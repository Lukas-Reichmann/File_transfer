Earnings have exceeded $5 billion, and ROCE has been greater than 12 percent for nine consecutive quarters. Cash returned to shareholders totaled $20 billion year-to-date, 27 percent higher than last year’s record total for the same period. “The acquisition of PDC Energy strengthened our position in important U.S. production basins,” Wirth continued. The DJ Basin now ranks among Chevron’s top-five producing assets. “We also acquired a majority stake in ACES Delta, LLC, the United States’ largest green hydrogen production and storage hub,” Wirth commented. “Chevron is delivering strong financial results while also investing to profitably grow our traditional and new energy businesses to drive superior value for shareholders,” Wirth concluded.

This includes approximately $400 million of inorganic spend largely due to the acquisition of a majority stake in ACES Delta, LLC, but excludes the acquisition of PDC Energy, Inc. • Quarterly shareholder distributions were $6.2 billion during the quarter, including dividends of $2.9 billion and share repurchases of $3.4 billion. Share repurchases were lower than the prior quarter due to restrictions related to the acquisition of PDC Energy, Inc. • The company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of one dollar and fifty-one cents ($1.51) per share, payable December 11, 2023, to all holders of common stock as shown on the transfer records of the corporation at the close of business on November 17, 2023.

This includes approximately $400 million of inorganic spend largely due to the acquisition of a majority stake in ACES Delta, LLC, but excludes the acquisition of PDC Energy, Inc. • Quarterly shareholder distributions were $6.2 billion during the quarter, including dividends of $2.9 billion and share repurchases of $3.4 billion. Share repurchases were lower than the prior quarter due to restrictions related to the acquisition of PDC Energy, Inc. • The company’s Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of one dollar and fifty-one cents ($1.51) per share, payable December 11, 2023, to all holders of common stock as shown on the transfer records of the corporation at the close of business on November 17, 2023.

Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements. The reader should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this news release. Unless legally required, Chevron undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements are: changing crude oil and natural gas prices and demand for the company’s products, and production curtailments due to market conditions; crude oil production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producing countries; technological advancements; changes to government policies in the countries in which the company operates; public health crises, such as pandemics (including coronavirus (COVID-19)) and epidemics, and any related government policies and actions; disruptions in the company’s global supply chain, including supply chain constraints and escalation of the cost of goods and services; changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which the company operates; general domestic and international economic, market and political conditions, including the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the war between Israel and Hamas and the global response to these hostilities; changing refining, marketing and chemicals margins; actions of competitors or regulators; timing of exploration expenses; timing of crude oil liftings; the competitiveness of alternate-energy sources or product substitutes; development of large carbon capture and offset markets; the results of operations and financial condition of the company’s suppliers, vendors, partners and equity affiliates; the inability or failure of the company’s joint-venture partners to fund their share of operations and development activities; the potential failure to achieve expected net production from existing and future crude oil and natural gas development projects; potential delays in the development, construction or start-up of planned projects; the potential disruption or interruption of the company’s operations due to war (including the war between Israel and Hamas and related military operations), accidents, political events, civil unrest, severe weather, cyber threats, terrorist acts, or other natural or human causes beyond the company’s control; the potential liability for remedial actions or assessments under existing or future environmental regulations and litigation; significant operational, investment or product changes undertaken or required by existing or future environmental statutes and regulations, including international agreements and national or regional legislation and regulatory measures to limit or reduce greenhouse gas emissions; the potential liability resulting from pending or future litigation; the ability to successfully integrate the operations of the company and PDC Energy, Inc. and achieve the anticipated benefits from the transaction, including the expected incremental annual free cash flow; the risk that Hess Corporation (Hess) stockholders do not approve the potential transaction, and the risk that regulatory approvals are not obtained or are obtained subject to conditions that are not anticipated by the company and Hess; potential delays in consummating the potential transaction, including as a result of regulatory approvals; the company’s ability to integrate Hess’ operations in a successful manner and in the expected time period; the possibility that any of the anticipated benefits and projected synergies of the potential transaction will not be realized or will not be realized within the expected time period; the company’s future acquisitions or dispositions of assets or shares or the delay or failure of such transactions to close based on required closing conditions; the potential for gains and losses from asset dispositions or impairments; government mandated sales, divestitures, recapitalizations, taxes and tax audits, tariffs, sanctions, changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on scope of company operations; foreign currency movements compared with the U.S. dollar; higher inflation and related impacts; material reductions in corporate liquidity and access to debt markets; the receipt of required Board authorizations to implement capital allocation strategies, including future stock repurchase programs and dividend payments; the effects of changed accounting rules under generally accepted accounting principles promulgated by rule-setting bodies; the company’s ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent in operating in the global energy industry; and the factors set forth under the heading “Risk Factors” on pages 20 through 26 of the company’s 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K and in subsequent filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Emerging growth company ☐ If an emerging growth company, indicate by check mark if the registrant has elected not to use the extended transition period for complying with any new or revised financial accounting standards provided pursuant to Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act. ☐ On October 22, 2023, Chevron Corporation (“ Chevron ”) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “ Merger Agreement ”) with Hess Corporation (“ Hess ”) and Yankee Merger Sub Inc., a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Chevron (“ Merger Subsidiary ”). The Merger Agreement provides that, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Merger Subsidiary will be merged with and into Hess, with Hess surviving and continuing as the surviving corporation of the Merger and as a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Chevron (such transaction, the “ Merger ”). At the effective time of the Merger (the “ Effective Time ”), each outstanding share of common stock of Hess, par value $1.00 per share (the “ Hess Common Stock ”), will be converted into the right to receive 1.025 (the “ Exchange Ratio ”) shares of common stock of Chevron, par value $0.75 per share (“ Chevron Common Stock ”), plus cash in lieu of any fractional shares of Chevron Common Stock that otherwise would have been issued (the “ Merger Consideration ”). Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, at the Effective Time, (i) each then outstanding Hess stock option and restricted stock award and each then outstanding performance share unit (“ PSU ”) award granted on or after the date of the Merger Agreement will be converted into corresponding Chevron equity awards based on the Exchange Ratio, subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to such awards immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that any performance conditions applicable to such PSU award will be deemed to be achieved at the target level as of the Effective Time) and (ii) each then outstanding PSU award granted prior to the date of the Merger Agreement will be deemed to be earned at the maximum level and converted into a restricted cash award in an amount per PSU award equal to the average closing trading price of a share of Chevron Common Stock for the 20 business days ending on and including the second to last business day prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, and in each case shall remain subject to the same terms and conditions as applied to such awards immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the performance conditions). The board of directors of Hess has unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and resolved to recommend the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Hess stockholders, who will be asked to vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement at a stockholders meeting. The board of directors of Chevron also unanimously approved the Merger Agreement. The completion of the Merger is subject to satisfaction or waiver of certain customary mutual closing conditions, including (1) the receipt of the required approval from Hess stockholders, (2) the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “ HSR Act ”), (3) the absence of any order or law prohibiting consummation of the Merger, (4) the effectiveness of the Registration Statement on Form S-4 to be filed by Chevron pursuant to which the shares of Chevron Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger will be registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “ SEC ”), and (5) the authorization for listing on the New York Stock Exchange of the shares of Chevron Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger. The obligation of each party to consummate the Merger is also conditioned upon the other party having performed in all material respects its obligations under the Merger Agreement and the other party’s representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement being true and correct (subject to certain materiality qualifiers). The Merger Agreement contains customary representations and warranties of Chevron and Hess relating to their respective businesses, financial statements and public filings, in each case generally subject to customary materiality qualifiers. Additionally, the Merger Agreement provides for customary pre-closing covenants of Hess and Chevron, including a covenant of Hess relating to using all reasonable best efforts to conduct its business in the ordinary course, subject to certain exceptions, and covenants of each party to refrain from taking certain actions without the other party’s consent. Hess and Chevron also agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to be consummated, to avoid or eliminate impediments under any antitrust laws or other applicable laws, and to obtain expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, subject to certain exceptions. The Merger Agreement provides that, during the period from the date of the Merger Agreement until the Effective Time or the earlier termination of the Merger Agreement, Hess is subject to certain restrictions on its ability to solicit alternative acquisition proposals from third parties, provide non-public information to third parties and engage in negotiations with third parties regarding alternative acquisition proposals, subject to certain exceptions. The Merger Agreement contains termination rights for each of Hess and Chevron, including, among others, (1) if the consummation of the Merger does not occur on or before April 18, 2024 (the “ End Date ”); except that the End Date will automatically be successively extended to October 22, 2024, April 22, 2025 and October 22, 2025 if all required applicable regulatory approvals have not been obtained by what would otherwise be the End Date but all other conditions to closing have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing, each of which is capable of being satisfied) or (to the extent permitted by law) waived; and (2) subject to certain conditions, if Hess desires to terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement). Upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, including the termination by Chevron in the event of a change of recommendation by the board of directors of Hess or by Hess in order to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, Hess would be required to pay Chevron a termination fee of $1,715,000,000. The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby in this Current Report on Form 8-K is only a summary and does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto and incorporated by reference herein. The parties expect to file the registration statement on Form S-4 containing Chevron’s preliminary prospectus and Hess’s preliminary proxy statement as promptly as practicable. The Merger Agreement has been included to provide investors with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about Hess or Chevron. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Merger Agreement were made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement as of the specific dates therein, were solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement, may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Investors are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the parties thereto or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in Hess’s or Chevron’s public disclosures. Voting and Support Agreement Concurrently with the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, Chevron entered into a Voting and Support Agreement (the “ Voting Agreement ”) with Hess and John B. Hess, whereby Mr. Hess has agreed to vote 29,222,682 shares of Hess Common Stock of which he has sole or shared record and/or beneficial ownership (approximately 9.5% of the outstanding Hess Common Stock) in favor of, among other things, the adoption of the Merger Agreement. The foregoing description is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Voting Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

The Merger Agreement provides that, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Merger Subsidiary will be merged with and into Hess, with Hess surviving and continuing as the surviving corporation of the Merger and as a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of Chevron (such transaction, the “ Merger ”).

The board of directors of Hess has unanimously approved the Merger Agreement and resolved to recommend the adoption of the Merger Agreement by Hess stockholders, who will be asked to vote on the adoption of the Merger Agreement at a stockholders meeting. The board of directors of Chevron also unanimously approved the Merger Agreement. The completion of the Merger is subject to satisfaction or waiver of certain customary mutual closing conditions, including (1) the receipt of the required approval from Hess stockholders, (2) the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the “ HSR Act ”), (3) the absence of any order or law prohibiting consummation of the Merger, (4) the effectiveness of the Registration Statement on Form S-4 to be filed by Chevron pursuant to which the shares of Chevron Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger will be registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “ SEC ”), and (5) the authorization for listing on the New York Stock Exchange of the shares of Chevron Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger. The obligation of each party to consummate the Merger is also conditioned upon the other party having performed in all material respects its obligations under the Merger Agreement and the other party’s representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement being true and correct (subject to certain materiality qualifiers). The Merger Agreement contains customary representations and warranties of Chevron and Hess relating to their respective businesses, financial statements and public filings, in each case generally subject to customary materiality qualifiers. Additionally, the Merger Agreement provides for customary pre-closing covenants of Hess and Chevron, including a covenant of Hess relating to using all reasonable best efforts to conduct its business in the ordinary course, subject to certain exceptions, and covenants of each party to refrain from taking certain actions without the other party’s consent. Hess and Chevron also agreed to use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to be consummated, to avoid or eliminate impediments under any antitrust laws or other applicable laws, and to obtain expiration or termination of the waiting period under the HSR Act, subject to certain exceptions. The Merger Agreement provides that, during the period from the date of the Merger Agreement until the Effective Time or the earlier termination of the Merger Agreement, Hess is subject to certain restrictions on its ability to solicit alternative acquisition proposals from third parties, provide non-public information to third parties and engage in negotiations with third parties regarding alternative acquisition proposals, subject to certain exceptions. The Merger Agreement contains termination rights for each of Hess and Chevron, including, among others, (1) if the consummation of the Merger does not occur on or before April 18, 2024 (the “ End Date ”); except that the End Date will automatically be successively extended to October 22, 2024, April 22, 2025 and October 22, 2025 if all required applicable regulatory approvals have not been obtained by what would otherwise be the End Date but all other conditions to closing have been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the closing, each of which is capable of being satisfied) or (to the extent permitted by law) waived; and (2) subject to certain conditions, if Hess desires to terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement). Upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, including the termination by Chevron in the event of a change of recommendation by the board of directors of Hess or by Hess in order to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, Hess would be required to pay Chevron a termination fee of $1,715,000,000. The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby in this Current Report on Form 8-K is only a summary and does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is filed as Exhibit 2.1 hereto and incorporated by reference herein. The parties expect to file the registration statement on Form S-4 containing Chevron’s preliminary prospectus and Hess’s preliminary proxy statement as promptly as practicable. The Merger Agreement has been included to provide investors with information regarding its terms. It is not intended to provide any other factual information about Hess or Chevron. The representations, warranties and covenants contained in the Merger Agreement were made only for purposes of the Merger Agreement as of the specific dates therein, were solely for the benefit of the parties to the Merger Agreement, may be subject to limitations agreed upon by the contracting parties, including being qualified by confidential disclosures made for the purposes of allocating contractual risk between the parties to the Merger Agreement instead of establishing these matters as facts, and may be subject to standards of materiality applicable to the contracting parties that differ from those applicable to investors. Investors are not third-party beneficiaries under the Merger Agreement and should not rely on the representations, warranties and covenants or any descriptions thereof as characterizations of the actual state of facts or condition of the parties thereto or any of their respective subsidiaries or affiliates. Moreover, information concerning the subject matter of representations and warranties may change after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in Hess’s or Chevron’s public disclosures. Voting and Support Agreement Concurrently with the execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement, Chevron entered into a Voting and Support Agreement (the “ Voting Agreement ”) with Hess and John B. Hess, whereby Mr. Hess has agreed to vote 29,222,682 shares of Hess Common Stock of which he has sole or shared record and/or beneficial ownership (approximately 9.5% of the outstanding Hess Common Stock) in favor of, among other things, the adoption of the Merger Agreement. The foregoing description is not complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Voting Agreement, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

THE COCA-COLA COMPANY (REGISTRANT) Date: July 23, 2019 By: / s / MARK RANDAZZA Mark Randazza Vice President, Assistant Controller and Chief Accounting Officer -;-EX-99.1:EX-99.1 2 a2019q2earningsreleaseex-9.htm EXHIBIT 99.1 Exhibit Coca-Cola Reports Continued Momentum in Second Quarter; Updates Full Year Guidance Net Revenues Grew 6%; Organic Revenues (Non-GAAP) Grew 6% Operating Income Grew 8%; Comparable Currency Neutral Operating Income (Non-GAAP) Grew 14% Operating Margin Was 29.9%; Comparable Operating Margin (Non-GAAP) Was 30.3%, Including the Impact from Currency Headwinds and Acquisitions EPS Grew 12% to $0.61; Comparable EPS (Non-GAAP) Grew 4% to $0.63, Despite a 9% Currency Headwind ATLANTA, July 23, 2019 – The Coca-Cola Company today reported strong operating results in the second quarter of 2019, driven by consumer-centric innovation, solid core brand performance and improved execution in the marketplace. Reported net revenues and organic revenues (non-GAAP) both grew 6% through balanced volume and price/mix, with all operating segments contributing to organic revenue (non-GAAP) growth. The company continued to gain global value share. The company’s performance year-to-date led to an update in full year guidance. ""Our strategy to transform as a total beverage company has allowed us to continue to win in a growing and vibrant industry,"" said James Quincey, chairman and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company. ""Our progress is positioning the company to create more value for all of our stakeholders, including our shareowners."" Highlights Quarterly Performance • Revenues: Net revenues grew 6% to $10.0 billion. Organic revenues (non-GAAP) grew 6%. Revenue growth was driven by concentrate sales growth of 4% and price/mix growth of 2%. • Margin: Operating margin, which included items impacting comparability, was 29.9% versus 29.4% in the prior year. Comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) was 30.3% versus 30.6% in the prior year. Strong underlying operating margin (non-GAAP) expansion was offset by an approximate 185 basis point negative impact from currency headwinds and net acquisitions. • Earnings per share: EPS grew 12% to $0.61. Comparable EPS (non-GAAP) grew 4% to $0.63. Comparable EPS growth included the impact from a 9-point currency headwind. • Market share: The company continued to gain value share in total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink (NARTD) beverages. • Cash flow: Year-to-date cash from operations was $4.5 billion, up 68% largely due to strong underlying growth, working capital initiatives and the timing of tax payments. Year-to-date free cash flow (non-GAAP) was $3.7 billion, up 87%. 1 Company Updates • Driving sparkling: Strong performance for the quarter was driven by sparkling soft drinks, led by 4% volume and transaction growth in trademark Coca-Cola. Coca-Cola Zero Sugar continues to perform well, with a seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit volume growth globally. Quarterly performance was further driven by innovation, such as Coca-Cola Plus Coffee, and a modernized marketing strategy for today's consumers. The company reached a first-of-its-kind partnership with Netflix to temporarily bring back 1985’s New Coke for the July 4 debut of season 3 of the hit series ""Stranger Things."" • Growing coffee: During the quarter, the company launched the first-ever Costa Coffee ready-to-drink (RTD) chilled product in Great Britain, marking the first major introduction since Coca-Cola acquired Costa earlier this year. The company plans to roll out the product in additional markets in the second half of the year. The brand delivers an authentic coffee taste experience with 30% less sugar than most RTD coffees in Costa’s core market of Great Britain. The Costa Coffee brand is also expanding through a new agreement with Coca-Cola HBC AG. The agreement will address a broad range of consumer and customer needs across multiple channels and occasions, including roast and ground coffee, RTD offerings and vending. The bottler plans to introduce Costa Coffee in at least 10 markets in 2020. • Expanding energy: The first energy drink under the Coca-Cola brand launched in select European countries during the quarter. Coca-Cola Energy features caffeine from naturally derived sources, guarana extracts, B vitamins and no taurine, all with the great Coca-Cola taste and feeling that people know and love. The product has shown early signs of success. Coca-Cola Energy is now available in 14 countries, including recent launches in Japan, Australia and South Africa. The company expects to offer Coca-Cola Energy in 20 markets by the end of 2019, including Mexico and Brazil . • Lifting, shifting and scaling: Since the company's initial investment in the innocent business in 2009, the innocent team has taken the business from the #1 smoothie brand in the U.K. to the #1 chilled juice brand across Europe. The brand is now expanding into Asia for the first time through a targeted rollout, starting in Tokyo. Innocent is loved by consumers who want more functional and nutritional benefits in their daily diet, in addition to those who enjoy natural, delicious and healthy juices and smoothies. • Making progress in packaging: The company continues to make progress on its World Without Waste goals for recycling, recyclable packaging and the use of recycled materials, including these recent milestones: • Bottlers worldwide continue to introduce more brands in 100% recycled PET (rPET) packaging. Recent launches include the green tea brand Hajime Ichinichi Ippon in Japan; the Romerquelle and Valser water brands in Austria and Switzerland, respectively; Viva water in the Philippines; and San Luis water in Peru. In Western Europe, 100% rPET bottles will be launched for smartwater, Chaudfontaine and Honest by the end of 2019. • Coca-Cola Amatil and Coca-Cola Australia announced that 70% of all PET bottles in the market will be made from 100% rPET by the end of 2019. • Coca-Cola European Partners and Coca-Cola Great Britain announced a switch from green to clear bottles for Sprite in their markets as a way to improve recycling. Other markets are making this change as well. • Coca-Cola Beverages Philippines, the bottling arm of Coca-Cola in the Philippines, announced that it will lead the investment in a $19 million state-of-the-art, food-grade recycling facility that will collect, sort, clean and wash post-consumer recyclable plastic bottles and turn them into new bottles using advanced technology. It is Coca-Cola’s first major investment in a recycling facility in Southeast Asia. • Coca-Cola Vietnam led the launch of an industry-backed packaging recovery organization alongside other companies. The organization will initially focus on increasing recovery and recycling rates for three materials: PET, aluminum and Tetra Pak ® . Tetra Pak ® is a U.S. registered trademark of Tetra Laval Holdings & Finance S.A. 2 Operating Review – Three Months Ended June 28, 2019 Revenues and Volume Percent Change Concentrate Sales 1 Price/Mix Currency Impact Acquisitions, Divestitures and Structural Items, Net Reported Net Revenues Organic Revenues 2 Unit Case Volume Consolidated 4 2 (6) 6 6 6 3 Europe, Middle East & Africa 3 1 (10) 3 (4) 4 2 Latin America 4 5 (11) (1) (3) 9 1 North America (1) 4 0 0 3 3 (1) Asia Pacific 8 (3) (3) 0 2 5 7 Global Ventures 3 5 (3) (19) 218 201 2 5 Bottling Investments 14 3 (7) (1) 9 18 30 Operating Income and EPS Percent Change Reported Operating Income Items Impacting Comparability Currency Impact Comparable Currency Neutral 2 Consolidated 8 3 (8) 14 Europe, Middle East & Africa (5) 0 (14) 9 Latin America (1) 0 (13) 12 North America 10 6 0 4 Asia Pacific 4 0 (3) 7 Global Ventures 96 0 (4) 100 Bottling Investments — 4 — 4 — 4 — 4 Percent Change Reported EPS Items Impacting Comparability Currency Impact Comparable Currency Neutral 2 Consolidated EPS 12 8 (9) 13 Note: Certain rows may not add due to rounding. 1 For Bottling Investments, this represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume computed based on total sales (rather than average daily sales) in each of the corresponding periods after considering the impact of structural changes. 2 Organic revenues, comparable currency neutral operating income and comparable currency neutral EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to the Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures section. 3 With the exception of RTD products, Costa sales are not included in concentrate sales, price/mix or unit case volume. 4 Reported operating income for the three months ended June 28, 2019 was $119 million. Reported operating loss for the three months ended June 29, 2018 was $17 million. Therefore, the percentages are not calculable. In addition to the data in the preceding tables, operating results in the quarter included the following: Consolidated • Price/mix grew 2% for the quarter through solid pricing in the marketplace across all operating segments. Concentrate sales growth of 4% was ahead of unit case volume growth primarily due to the timing of shipments in Brazil. • Unit case volume grew 3%, driven by strong growth in developing and emerging markets. Category cluster performance was as follows: ◦ Sparkling soft drinks grew 3%, driven by strong 4% global growth in trademark Coca-Cola, including growth in original Coca-Cola and continued double-digit growth in Coca-Cola Zero Sugar. 3 ◦ Juice, dairy and plant-based beverages volume was even as strong performance in the Maaza brand in India and the innocent business across Europe was offset by a decline in Rani, the leading juice brand in the Middle East. ◦ Water, enhanced water and sports drinks grew 2%, led by the Ciel and Cristal brands in Mexico as well as the Kinley brand in India, partially offset by a decline in the company's water brands in Japan. The decline in Japan was primarily due to deprioritization of low-margin commodity water brands. ◦ Tea and coffee volume declined 3% as growth in Fuze Tea across Europe and Mexico was offset by a decline in the doğadan tea business in Turkey, in addition to the company's tea brands in Japan. • Operating income grew 8% including a negative impact from currency. Comparable currency neutral operating income (non-GAAP) grew 14%. Operating income growth was driven by strong organic revenue (non-GAAP) growth, a benefit from acquisitions and ongoing productivity initiatives. Europe, Middle East & Africa • Price/mix grew 1% for the quarter, which included a 2-point headwind from geographic mix due to strong growth across key African markets, including South Africa and Nigeria. • Unit case volume grew 2%, as growth across the majority of markets was partially offset by declines in Zimbabwe and the Middle East. Growth was led by sparkling soft drinks and Fuze Tea. • Operating income declined 5%, primarily due to a 14-point currency headwind. Comparable currency neutral operating income (non-GAAP) grew 9%, primarily driven by organic revenue (non-GAAP) growth in addition to a benefit from the timing of expenses . • The company gained value share in total NARTD beverages, led by solid share performance across Europe, in addition to gaining share across all category clusters. Latin America • Price/mix grew 5% for the quarter, largely driven by strong performance in Mexico and Brazil, in addition to inflationary pricing in Argentina. • Unit case volume grew 1% as growth across the majority of key markets, led by Brazil and Mexico, was partially offset by a decline in Argentina. • Operating income declined 1%, which included a 13-point currency headwind. Comparable currency neutral operating income (non-GAAP) grew 12%. Operating income growth was largely driven by the benefit of strong pricing in the marketplace. • The company lost value share in total NARTD beverages as a gain in sparkling soft drinks was offset by a loss in packaged water. North America • Price/mix grew 4% for the quarter, driven by sparkling soft drinks. • Unit case volume declined 1% partially due to the impact of pricing and package initiatives executed in the marketplace, which is driving positive price/mix performance. Positive performance in trademark Coca-Cola was driven by double-digit growth in Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and innovation such as Coca-Cola Orange Vanilla. 4 • Operating income grew 10%. Comparable currency neutral operating income (non-GAAP) grew 4%. Growth was largely driven by favorable product mix, with sparkling soft drinks as the main driver. • The company gained value share in total NARTD beverages led by strong performance in sparkling soft drinks; water, enhanced water and sports drinks; and juice, dairy and plant-based beverages. Asia Pacific • Price/mix declined 3% for the quarter, largely driven by geographic mix due to growth in emerging and developing markets outpacing developed markets. • Unit case volume grew 7% due to broad-based growth across nearly all key markets. Volume growth was led by India, Southeast Asia and China. • Operating income grew 4%. Comparable currency neutral operating income (non-GAAP) grew 7%. Operating income growth was primarily driven by organic revenue (non-GAAP) growth and a benefit from the timing of expenses. • The company gained value share in total NARTD beverages, driven by strong performance in China and Southeast Asia. Global Ventures • Reported net revenues benefited from the Costa acquisition. • Price/mix declined 3%, largely driven by innocent product mix as growth in juices outpaced smoothies, in addition to cycling strong 8% price/mix growth in the prior year. • Unit case volume grew 5% as strong growth in innocent and the energy category was partially offset by a decline in the doğadan tea business in Turkey. • Operating income growth benefited from the Costa acquisition. Bottling Investments • During the quarter, the company announced that it will maintain its majority stake in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa (CCBA) for the foreseeable future. As a result, CCBA is now presented within the company’s results from continuing operations and is included in the Bottling Investments operating segment. • Price/mix grew 3% for the quarter, largely driven by solid performance from CCBA and the company's bottling operations in India. • Operating income was favorably impacted by comparability items and the acquisition of bottling operations in the Philippines. 5 Operating Review – Six Months Ended June 28, 2019 Revenues and Volume Percent Change Concentrate Sales 1 Price/Mix Currency Impact Acquisitions, Divestitures and Structural Items, Net Reported Net Revenues Organic Revenues 2 Unit Case Volume Consolidated 3 3 (6) 6 5 6 2 Europe, Middle East & Africa 4 5 (11) 3 0 9 2 Latin America 0 7 (13) 0 (6) 7 0 North America (2) 4 0 0 2 2 (1) Asia Pacific 7 (2) (3) (1) 0 4 7 Global Ventures 3 1 0 (20) 220 201 1 3 Bottling Investments 9 3 (8) (2) 3 13 23 Operating Income and EPS Percent Change Reported Operating Income Items Impacting Comparability Currency Impact Comparable Currency Neutral 2 Consolidated 15 11 (9) 14 Europe, Middle East & Africa 0 0 (14) 15 Latin America (7) 0 (16) 9 North America 13 7 0 6 Asia Pacific 1 0 (3) 3 Global Ventures 110 0 (6) 116 Bottling Investments — 4 — 4 64 372 Percent Change Reported EPS Items Impacting Comparability Currency Impact Comparable Currency Neutral 2 Consolidated 16 13 (9) 13 Note: Certain rows may not add due to rounding. 1 For Bottling Investments, this represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume computed based on total sales (rather than average daily sales) in each of the corresponding periods after considering the impact of structural changes. 2 Organic revenues, comparable currency neutral operating income and comparable currency neutral EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to the Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures section. 3 With the exception of RTD products, Costa sales are not included in concentrate sales, price/mix or unit case volume. 4 Reported operating income for the six months ended June 28, 2019 was $219 million. Reported operating loss for the six months ended June 29, 2018 was $342 million. Therefore, the percentages are not calculable. 6 Outlook The 2019 outlook information provided below includes forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, which management uses in measuring performance. The company is not able to reconcile full year 2019 projected organic revenues (non-GAAP) to full year 2019 projected reported net revenues, full year 2019 projected comparable currency neutral net revenues (non-GAAP) to full year 2019 projected reported net revenues, full year 2019 projected comparable currency neutral operating income (non-GAAP) to full year 2019 projected reported operating income, or full year 2019 projected comparable EPS (non-GAAP) to full year 2019 projected reported EPS without unreasonable efforts because it is not possible to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the actual impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates; the exact timing and amount of acquisitions, divestitures and/or structural changes; and the exact timing and amount of comparability items throughout 2019. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on full year 2019 GAAP financial results. Full Year 2019 Revenues: • 5% growth in organic revenues (non-GAAP) – Updated • 12% growth in comparable currency neutral net revenues (non-GAAP), including a 7% tailwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural items – Updated • Comparable net revenues (non-GAAP): 4% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions – Updated Full Year 2019 Operating Income: • 11% to 12% growth in comparable currency neutral operating income (non-GAAP), including a low single-digit tailwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural items – Updated • Comparable operating income (non-GAAP): 7% to 8% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions – Updated Full Year 2019 EPS: • -1% to 1% growth versus $2.08 in 2018 in comparable EPS (non-GAAP) – No Change Full Year 2019 Other Items: • Underlying effective tax rate (non-GAAP): Estimated to be 19.5% – No Change • Cash from operations: At least $8.5 billion – Updated • Capital expenditures: Approximately $2.4 billion – Updated • Net share repurchases (non-GAAP): Share repurchases to offset dilution from employee stock-based compensation plans – No Change Third Quarter 2019 Considerations – New : • Comparable net revenues (non-GAAP): 6% tailwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural items; 3% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions • Comparable operating income (non-GAAP): 6% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions 7 Notes • All references to growth rate percentages and share compare the results of the period to those of the prior year comparable period. • All references to volume and volume percentage changes indicate unit case volume, unless otherwise noted. All volume percentage changes are computed based on average daily sales, unless otherwise noted. ""Unit case"" means a unit of measurement equal to 24 eight-ounce servings of finished beverage. ""Unit case volume"" means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of company beverages directly or indirectly sold by the company and its bottling partners to customers. • ""Concentrate sales"" represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, beverage bases, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in equivalent unit cases) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the company to its bottling partners or other customers. In the reconciliation of reported net revenues, ""concentrate sales"" represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in concentrate sales volume for the geographic operating segments and the Global Ventures operating segment (excluding Costa non-RTD sales) (expressed in equivalent unit cases) after considering the impact of structural changes. For the Bottling Investments operating segment, this represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume computed based on total sales (rather than average daily sales) in each of the corresponding periods after considering the impact of structural changes. The Bottling Investments operating segment reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only. • ""Price/mix"" represents the change in net operating revenues caused by factors such as price changes, the mix of products and packages sold, and the mix of channels and geographic territories where the sales occurred. • First quarter 2019 financial results were impacted by one less day as compared to the same period in 2018, and fourth quarter 2019 financial results will be impacted by one additional day as compared to the same period in 2018. Unit case volume results for the quarters are not impacted by the variances in days due to the average daily sales computation referenced above. Conference Call The company is hosting a conference call with investors and analysts to discuss second quarter 2019 operating results today, July 23, 2019, at 8:30 a.m. ET. The company invites participants to listen to a live webcast of the conference call on the company’s website, http://www.coca-colacompany.com, in the ""Investors"" section. An audio replay in downloadable digital format and a transcript of the call will be available on the website within 24 hours following the call.

To supplement our consolidated financial statements reported on a GAAP basis, we provide the following non-GAAP financial measures: ""comparable net revenues"", ""comparable currency neutral net revenues"", ""organic revenues"", ""comparable operating margin"", ""underlying operating margin"", ""comparable operating income"", ""comparable currency neutral operating income"", ""comparable EPS"", ""comparable currency neutral EPS"", ""underlying effective tax rate"", ""free cash flow"" and ""net share repurchases"", each of which are defined below. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with additional meaningful financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends. Further, management believes these non-GAAP financial measures also enhance investors' ability to compare period-to-period financial results. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the company's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures do not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. Therefore, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP information are also included. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating, compensation and planning decisions and in evaluating the company's performance. Disclosing these non-GAAP financial measures allows investors and company management to view our operating results excluding the impact of items that are not reflective of the underlying operating performance. DEFINITIONS • ""Currency neutral operating results"" are determined by dividing or multiplying, as appropriate, our current period actual U.S. dollar operating results, by the current period actual exchange rates (that include the impact of current period currency hedging activities), to derive our current period local currency operating results. We then multiply or divide, as appropriate, the derived current period local currency operating results by the foreign currency exchange rates (that also include the impact of the comparable prior period currency hedging activities) used to translate the company's financial statements in the comparable prior year period to determine what the current period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the foreign currency exchange rates had not changed from the comparable prior year period. • ""Structural changes"" generally refer to acquisitions and divestitures of bottling and distribution operations including the impact of intercompany transactions among our operating segments. In 2019, the company acquired bottling operations in Zambia. In 2018, the company acquired controlling interests in the Philippine bottling operations and Oman bottling operations, both of which were previously accounted for as equity method investees, as well as bottling operations in Botswana and Zambia. The impact of these acquisitions has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Europe, Middle East and Africa, Asia Pacific and Bottling Investments operating segments. In 2018, the company refranchised our Canadian and Latin American bottling operations. The impact of these refranchising activities has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the North America, Latin America and Bottling Investments operating segments. • ""Comparable net revenues"" is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability (discussed further below). ""Comparable currency neutral net revenues"" is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability (discussed further below) as well as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Management believes the comparable net revenues (non-GAAP) growth measure and the comparable currency neutral net revenues (non‑GAAP) growth measure provide investors with useful supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the company's revenue performance and trends by improving their ability to compare our period-to-period results. ""Organic revenues"" is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and structural items, as applicable, and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Management believes the organic revenue (non-GAAP) growth measure provides users with useful supplemental information regarding the company's ongoing revenue performance and trends by presenting revenue growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange as well as the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and structural items. The adjustments related to acquisitions, divestitures and structural items for the three and six months ended June 28, 2019 and June 29, 2018 consisted of the structural changes discussed above. Additionally, in 2019, the 15 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures (UNAUDITED) company acquired Costa Limited (""Costa""). The impact of this acquisition has been included in acquisitions and divestitures in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Global Ventures operating segment. In 2019, the company also acquired the remaining equity interest in C.H.I. Limited (""CHI""). The impact of this acquisition has been included in acquisitions and divestitures in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Europe, Middle East and Africa operating segment. • ""Comparable operating income"" is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability (discussed further below). ""Comparable currency neutral operating income"" is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability (discussed further below) and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. ""Comparable operating margin"" is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability (discussed further below). ""Underlying operating margin"" is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability (discussed further below), the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and structural items, as applicable. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the company's performance and make resource allocation decisions. Further, management believes the comparable operating income (non-GAAP) growth measure, comparable currency neutral operating income (non-GAAP) growth measure, comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) measure and underlying operating margin (non-GAAP) measure enhance its ability to communicate the underlying operating results and provide investors with useful supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the company's underlying business performance and trends by improving their ability to compare our period-to-period financial results. • ""Comparable EPS"" and ""comparable currency neutral EPS"" are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude or have otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability (discussed further below). Comparable currency neutral EPS (non-GAAP) has also been adjusted for the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the company's performance and make resource allocation decisions. Further, management believes the comparable EPS (non-GAAP) and comparable currency neutral EPS (non-GAAP) growth measures enhance its ability to communicate the underlying operating results and provide investors with useful supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the company's underlying business performance and trends by improving their ability to compare our period-to-period financial results. • ""Underlying effective tax rate"" is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents the estimated annual effective income tax rate on income before income taxes, which excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability (discussed further below). • ""Free cash flow"" is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate the company's performance and make resource allocation decisions. • ""Net share repurchases"" is a non-GAAP financial measure that reflects the net amount of purchases of stock for treasury after considering proceeds from the issuances of stock, the net change in stock issuance receivables (related to employee stock options exercised but not settled prior to the end of the period) and the net change in treasury stock payables (for treasury shares repurchased but not settled prior to the end of the period). ITEMS IMPACTING COMPARABILITY The following information is provided to give qualitative and quantitative information related to items impacting comparability. Items impacting comparability are not defined terms within GAAP. Therefore, our non-GAAP financial information may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We determine which items to consider as ""items impacting comparability"" based on how management views our business; makes financial, operating, compensation and planning decisions; and evaluates the company's ongoing performance. Items such as charges, gains and accounting changes which are viewed by management as impacting only the current period or the comparable period, but not both, or as pertaining to different and unrelated underlying activities or events across comparable periods, are generally considered ""items impacting comparability."" Items impacting comparability include, but are not limited to, asset impairments, charges related to our productivity and reinvestment initiatives, and transaction 16 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures (UNAUDITED) gains/losses, in each case when exceeding a U.S. dollar threshold. Also included are our proportionate share of similar items incurred by our equity method investees, timing differences related to our economic (nondesignated) hedging activities, and timing differences related to unrealized mark-to-market adjustments of equity securities and trading debt securities, regardless of size. In addition, we provide the impact that changes in foreign currency exchange rates had on our financial results (""currency neutral operating results"" defined above). Asset Impairments During the three and six months ended June 28, 2019 , the company recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $49 million related to one of our equity method investees in Latin America. During the six months ended June 28, 2019 , the company recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $286 million related to Coca-Cola Bottlers Japan Holdings Inc. (""CCBJHI""), an equity method investee. Based on the length of time and the extent to which the market value of our investment in CCBJHI has been less than our carrying value and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, management determined that the decline in fair value was other than temporary in nature. During the six months ended June 28, 2019 , we also recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $57 million related to one of our equity method investees in North America. This charge was primarily driven by revised projections of future operating results. During the three and six months ended June 29, 2018, the company recorded charges of $60 million and $450 million, respectively, related to the impairment of Coca-Cola Refreshments (""CCR"") assets that are recorded in our Bottling Investments operating segment, primarily as a result of management's view of the proceeds that are expected to be received for the remaining bottling territories upon their refranchising. These charges were determined by comparing the fair values of the assets to their carrying values. The company also recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $52 million during the three and six months ended June 29, 2018 related to one of our equity method investees in Latin America. Productivity and Reinvestment During the three and six months ended June 28, 2019 , the company recorded charges of $55 million and $123 million, respectively, related to our productivity and reinvestment initiatives. During the three and six months ended June 29, 2018 , the company recorded charges of $150 million and $245 million, respectively, which included $39 million due to pension settlements. These initiatives are focused on four key areas: restructuring the company's global supply chain; implementing zero-based work, an evolution of zero-based budget principles across the organization; streamlining and simplifying the company's operating model; and further driving increased discipline and efficiency in direct marketing investments. Under this operating model, our business units will be supported by an expanded enabling services organization and a corporate center focused on a few strategic initiatives, policy and governance. The expanded enabling services organization will focus on both simplifying and standardizing key transactional processes and providing support to business units through global centers of excellence. The savings realized from the program will enable the company to fund marketing initiatives and innovation required to deliver sustainable net revenue growth. The savings will also support margin expansion and increased returns on invested capital over time. Equity Investees During the three and six months ended June 28, 2019 , the company recorded net charges of $26 million and $68 million, respectively. During the three and six months ended June 29, 2018 , the company recorded net charges of $33 million and $84 million, respectively. These amounts represent the company’s proportionate share of significant operating and nonoperating items recorded by certain of our equity method investees. Transaction Gains/Losses During the three and six months ended June 28, 2019 , the company recorded an adjustment to reduce the carrying amount of Coca-Cola Beverages Africa's (""CCBA"") fixed assets and definite-lived intangible assets by $160 million as a result of the company's change in plans for CCBA as it now intends to maintain its controlling stake in CCBA for the foreseeable future. During the three and six months ended June 28, 2019 , the company recorded charges of $29 million and $40 million, respectively, primarily related to costs incurred to refranchise certain of our North America bottling operations. The 17 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures (UNAUDITED) company also recorded charges of $34 million and $79 million during the three and six months ended June 29, 2018 , respectively. These costs include, among other items, internal and external costs for individuals directly working on the refranchising efforts, severance, special termination benefits, and costs associated with the implementation of information technology systems to facilitate consistent data standards and availability throughout our bottling systems. During the six months ended June 28, 2019 , the company recorded charges of $4 million related to North America refranchising. During the three and six months ended June 29, 2018 , the company recorded net charges of $102 million and $104 million, respectively. These net charges were primarily related to post-closing adjustments as contemplated by the related agreements. During the six months ended June 28, 2019 , the company recorded charges of $4 million. During the three and six months ended June 29, 2018 , the company recorded charges of $2 million and $21 million, respectively. These charges were primarily related to payments made to certain of our unconsolidated bottling partners in North America in order to convert their bottling agreements to a comprehensive beverage agreement with additional requirements. During the three and six months ended June 28, 2019 , the company recorded charges of $8 million. The company also recorded charges of $3 million during the three and six months ended June 29, 2018 . These charges were for noncapitalizable transaction costs associated with pending and closed transactions. During the six months ended June 28, 2019 , the company recognized a $121 million loss in conjunction with our acquisition of the remaining equity ownership interest in CHI, which included the remeasurement of our previously held equity interest in CHI to fair value and the reversal of the related cumulative translation adjustments. During the six months ended June 28, 2019 , the company incurred $46 million of transaction costs associated with the purchase of Costa, which we acquired in January 2019. During the six months ended June 28, 2019 , the company recorded a gain of $39 million related to the sale of a portion of our equity ownership interest in Embotelladora Andina S.A. (""Andina""). During the three and six months ended June 29, 2018, the company recorded charges of $47 million due to pension settlements. During the three and six months ended June 29, 2018 , the company recorded a net gain of $36 million due to the refranchising of our Latin American bottling operations. During the six months ended June 29, 2018 , the company recorded a net loss of $33 million primarily related to the reversal of the cumulative translation adjustments resulting from the substantial liquidation of the company's former Russian juice operations. CCBA Unrecognized Depreciation and Amortization These amounts represent the depreciation and amortization that the company would have recorded during the periods presented had CCBA not been classified as held for sale. Other Items Economic (Nondesignated) Hedges The company uses derivatives as economic hedges primarily to mitigate the foreign exchange risk for certain currencies and the price risk associated with the purchase of materials used in the manufacturing process as well as the purchase of vehicle fuel. Although these derivatives were not designated and/or did not qualify for hedge accounting, they are effective economic hedges. The changes in fair values of these economic hedges are immediately recognized into earnings. The company excludes the net impact of mark-to-market adjustments for outstanding hedges and realized gains/losses for settled hedges from our non-GAAP financial information until the period in which the underlying exposure being hedged impacts our condensed consolidated statement of income. Management believes this adjustment provides meaningful information related to the impact of our economic hedging activities. During the three and six months ended June 28, 2019 , the net impact of the company's adjustment related to our economic hedging activities resulted in an increase of $9 million and a decrease of $10 million, respectively, to our non-GAAP income before income taxes. 18 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures (UNAUDITED) During the three and six months ended June 29, 2018 , the net impact of the company's adjustment related to our economic hedging activities resulted in decreases of $22 million and $32 million, respectively, to our non-GAAP income before income taxes. Unrealized Gains and Losses on Equity and Trading Debt Securities The company excludes the net impact of unrealized gains and losses resulting from mark-to-market adjustments on our equity and trading debt securities from our non-GAAP financial information until the period in which the underlying securities are sold and the associated gains or losses are realized. Management believes this adjustment provides meaningful information related to the impact of our investments in equity and trading debt securities. During the three and six months ended June 28, 2019 , the net impact of the company's adjustment related to unrealized gains and losses on our equity and trading debt securities resulted in an increase of $23 million and a decrease of $138 million, respectively, to our non-GAAP income before income taxes. During the three and six months ended June 29, 2018 , the net impact of the company's adjustment related to unrealized gains and losses on our equity and trading debt securities resulted in a decrease of $25 million and an increase of $72 million, respectively, to our non-GAAP income before income taxes. Other During the six months ended June 28, 2019 , the company recorded other charges of $2 million related to tax litigation expense. During the three and six months ended June 29, 2018 , the company recorded other charges of $22 million and $27 million, respectively. These charges were primarily related to tax litigation expense. Certain Tax Matters and Tax Reform Certain Tax Matters During the three and six months ended June 28, 2019 , the company recorded $108 million and $135 million, respectively, related to excess tax benefits associated with the company's share-based compensation arrangements and the reversal of a U.S. state valuation allowance. During the three and six months ended June 28, 2019 , the excess tax benefits were partially offset by net tax charges of $98 million and $103 million, respectively, for changes to our uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, as well as for agreed-upon tax matters. During the three and six months ended June 29, 2018 , the company recorded $42 million of income tax benefit and $134 million of income tax expense, respectively, primarily as a result of adjustments to our provisional remeasurement of deferred taxes recorded as of December 31, 2017 related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""Tax Reform Act"") signed into law on December 22, 2017. During the three and six months ended June 29, 2018 , the company also recorded net tax charges of $8 million and $42 million, respectively, for changes to our uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, as well as for agreed-upon tax matters. In addition, during the three and six months ended June 29, 2018 , the company recorded $3 million and $87 million, respectively, of excess tax benefits associated with the company's share‑based compensation arrangements. 2019 OUTLOOK The 2019 outlook information provided in this earnings release includes forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, which management uses in measuring performance. The company is not able to reconcile full year 2019 projected organic revenues (non-GAAP) to full year 2019 projected reported net revenues, full year 2019 projected comparable currency neutral net revenues (non-GAAP) to full year 2019 projected reported net revenues, full year 2019 projected comparable currency neutral operating income (non-GAAP) to full year 2019 projected reported operating income, or full year 2019 projected comparable EPS (non-GAAP) to full year 2019 projected reported EPS without unreasonable efforts because it is not possible to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the actual impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates; the exact timing and amount of acquisitions, divestitures and/or structural changes; and the exact timing and amount of comparability items throughout 2019. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on full year 2019 GAAP financial results. 19 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures (UNAUDITED) (In millions except per share data) Three Months Ended June 28, 2019 Net operating revenues Cost of goods sold Gross profit Gross margin Selling, general and administrative expenses Other operating charges Operating income Operating margin Reported (GAAP) $ 9,997 $ 3,921 $ 6,076 60.8 % $ 2,996 $ 92 $ 2,988 29.9 % Items Impacting Comparability: Asset Impairments — — — — — — Productivity and Reinvestment — — — — (55 ) 55 Equity Investees — — — — — — Transaction Gains/Losses — — — — (37 ) 37 CCBA Unrecognized Depreciation and Amortization — 16 (16 ) 44 — (60 ) Other Items — (10 ) 10 — — 10 Certain Tax Matters — — — — — — Comparable (Non-GAAP) $ 9,997 $ 3,927 $ 6,070 60.7 % $ 3,040 $ — $ 3,030 30.3 % Three Months Ended June 29, 2018 Net operating revenues Cost of goods sold Gross profit Gross margin Selling, general and administrative expenses Other operating charges Operating income Operating margin Reported (GAAP) $ 9,421 $ 3,543 $ 5,878 62.4 % $ 2,887 $ 225 $ 2,766 29.4 % Items Impacting Comparability: Asset Impairments — — — — (60 ) 60 Productivity and Reinvestment — — — — (111 ) 111 Equity Investees — — — — — — Transaction Gains/Losses — — — — (37 ) 37 CCBA Unrecognized Depreciation and Amortization — 24 (24 ) 73 — (97 ) Other Items (24 ) (1 ) (23 ) (1 ) (17 ) (5 ) Certain Tax Matters — — — — — — Comparable (Non-GAAP) $ 9,397 $ 3,566 $ 5,831 62.0 % $ 2,959 $ — $ 2,872 30.6 % Net operating revenues Cost of goods sold Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Other operating charges Operating income % Change — Reported (GAAP) 6 11 3 4 (59) 8 % Currency Impact (6) (4) (7) (5) — (10) % Change — Currency Neutral (Non-GAAP) 12 14 10 9 — 18 % Change — Comparable (Non-GAAP) 6 10 4 3 — 6 % Comparable Currency Impact (Non-GAAP) (6) (4) (7) (5) — (8) % Change — Comparable Currency Neutral (Non-GAAP) 12 14 11 8 — 14 Note: Certain columns may not add due to rounding.

Reported net revenues and organic revenues (non-GAAP) both grew 6% through balanced volume and price/mix, with all operating segments contributing to organic revenue (non-GAAP) growth. The company continued to gain global value share. The company’s performance year-to-date led to an update in full year guidance. ""Our strategy to transform as a total beverage company has allowed us to continue to win in a growing and vibrant industry,"" said James Quincey, chairman and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company. ""Our progress is positioning the company to create more value for all of our stakeholders, including our shareowners."" Highlights Quarterly Performance • Revenues: Net revenues grew 6% to $10.0 billion. Organic revenues (non-GAAP) grew 6%. Revenue growth was driven by concentrate sales growth of 4% and price/mix growth of 2%. • Margin: Operating margin, which included items impacting comparability, was 29.9% versus 29.4% in the prior year. Comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) was 30.3% versus 30.6% in the prior year. Strong underlying operating margin (non-GAAP) expansion was offset by an approximate 185 basis point negative impact from currency headwinds and net acquisitions. • Earnings per share: EPS grew 12% to $0.61. Comparable EPS (non-GAAP) grew 4% to $0.63. Comparable EPS growth included the impact from a 9-point currency headwind. • Market share: The company continued to gain value share in total nonalcoholic ready-to-drink (NARTD) beverages. • Cash flow: Year-to-date cash from operations was $4.5 billion, up 68% largely due to strong underlying growth, working capital initiatives and the timing of tax payments. Year-to-date free cash flow (non-GAAP) was $3.7 billion, up 87%. 1 Company Updates • Driving sparkling: Strong performance for the quarter was driven by sparkling soft drinks, led by 4% volume and transaction growth in trademark Coca-Cola. Coca-Cola Zero Sugar continues to perform well, with a seventh consecutive quarter of double-digit volume growth globally. Quarterly performance was further driven by innovation, such as Coca-Cola Plus Coffee, and a modernized marketing strategy for today's consumers. The company reached a first-of-its-kind partnership with Netflix to temporarily bring back 1985’s New Coke for the July 4 debut of season 3 of the hit series ""Stranger Things."" • Growing coffee: During the quarter, the company launched the first-ever Costa Coffee ready-to-drink (RTD) chilled product in Great Britain, marking the first major introduction since Coca-Cola acquired Costa earlier this year. The company plans to roll out the product in additional markets in the second half of the year. The brand delivers an authentic coffee taste experience with 30% less sugar than most RTD coffees in Costa’s core market of Great Britain. The Costa Coffee brand is also expanding through a new agreement with Coca-Cola HBC AG. The agreement will address a broad range of consumer and customer needs across multiple channels and occasions, including roast and ground coffee, RTD offerings and vending. The bottler plans to introduce Costa Coffee in at least 10 markets in 2020. • Expanding energy: The first energy drink under the Coca-Cola brand launched in select European countries during the quarter. Coca-Cola Energy features caffeine from naturally derived sources, guarana extracts, B vitamins and no taurine, all with the great Coca-Cola taste and feeling that people know and love. The product has shown early signs of success. Coca-Cola Energy is now available in 14 countries, including recent launches in Japan, Australia and South Africa. The company expects to offer Coca-Cola Energy in 20 markets by the end of 2019, including Mexico and Brazil . • Lifting, shifting and scaling: Since the company's initial investment in the innocent business in 2009, the innocent team has taken the business from the #1 smoothie brand in the U.K. to the #1 chilled juice brand across Europe. The brand is now expanding into Asia for the first time through a targeted rollout, starting in Tokyo. Innocent is loved by consumers who want more functional and nutritional benefits in their daily diet, in addition to those who enjoy natural, delicious and healthy juices and smoothies. • Making progress in packaging: The company continues to make progress on its World Without Waste goals for recycling, recyclable packaging and the use of recycled materials, including these recent milestones: • Bottlers worldwide continue to introduce more brands in 100% recycled PET (rPET) packaging. Recent launches include the green tea brand Hajime Ichinichi Ippon in Japan; the Romerquelle and Valser water brands in Austria and Switzerland, respectively; Viva water in the Philippines; and San Luis water in Peru. In Western Europe, 100% rPET bottles will be launched for smartwater, Chaudfontaine and Honest by the end of 2019. • Coca-Cola Amatil and Coca-Cola Australia announced that 70% of all PET bottles in the market will be made from 100% rPET by the end of 2019. • Coca-Cola European Partners and Coca-Cola Great Britain announced a switch from green to clear bottles for Sprite in their markets as a way to improve recycling. Other markets are making this change as well. • Coca-Cola Beverages Philippines, the bottling arm of Coca-Cola in the Philippines, announced that it will lead the investment in a $19 million state-of-the-art, food-grade recycling facility that will collect, sort, clean and wash post-consumer recyclable plastic bottles and turn them into new bottles using advanced technology. It is Coca-Cola’s first major investment in a recycling facility in Southeast Asia. • Coca-Cola Vietnam led the launch of an industry-backed packaging recovery organization alongside other companies. The organization will initially focus on increasing recovery and recycling rates for three materials: PET, aluminum and Tetra Pak ® . Tetra Pak ® is a U.S. registered trademark of Tetra Laval Holdings & Finance S.A. 2 Operating Review – Three Months Ended June 28, 2019 Revenues and Volume Percent Change Concentrate Sales 1 Price/Mix Currency Impact Acquisitions, Divestitures and Structural Items, Net Reported Net Revenues Organic Revenues 2 Unit Case Volume Consolidated 4 2 (6) 6 6 6 3 Europe, Middle East & Africa 3 1 (10) 3 (4) 4 2 Latin America 4 5 (11) (1) (3) 9 1 North America (1) 4 0 0 3 3 (1) Asia Pacific 8 (3) (3) 0 2 5 7 Global Ventures 3 5 (3) (19) 218 201 2 5 Bottling Investments 14 3 (7) (1) 9 18 30 Operating Income and EPS Percent Change Reported Operating Income Items Impacting Comparability Currency Impact Comparable Currency Neutral 2 Consolidated 8 3 (8) 14 Europe, Middle East & Africa (5) 0 (14) 9 Latin America (1) 0 (13) 12 North America 10 6 0 4 Asia Pacific 4 0 (3) 7 Global Ventures 96 0 (4) 100 Bottling Investments — 4 — 4 — 4 — 4 Percent Change Reported EPS Items Impacting Comparability Currency Impact Comparable Currency Neutral 2 Consolidated EPS 12 8 (9) 13 Note: Certain rows may not add due to rounding. 1 For Bottling Investments, this represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume computed based on total sales (rather than average daily sales) in each of the corresponding periods after considering the impact of structural changes. 2 Organic revenues, comparable currency neutral operating income and comparable currency neutral EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to the Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures section. 3 With the exception of RTD products, Costa sales are not included in concentrate sales, price/mix or unit case volume. 4 Reported operating income for the three months ended June 28, 2019 was $119 million. Reported operating loss for the three months ended June 29, 2018 was $17 million. Therefore, the percentages are not calculable. In addition to the data in the preceding tables, operating results in the quarter included the following: Consolidated • Price/mix grew 2% for the quarter through solid pricing in the marketplace across all operating segments. Concentrate sales growth of 4% was ahead of unit case volume growth primarily due to the timing of shipments in Brazil. • Unit case volume grew 3%, driven by strong growth in developing and emerging markets. Category cluster performance was as follows: ◦ Sparkling soft drinks grew 3%, driven by strong 4% global growth in trademark Coca-Cola, including growth in original Coca-Cola and continued double-digit growth in Coca-Cola Zero Sugar. 3 ◦ Juice, dairy and plant-based beverages volume was even as strong performance in the Maaza brand in India and the innocent business across Europe was offset by a decline in Rani, the leading juice brand in the Middle East. ◦ Water, enhanced water and sports drinks grew 2%, led by the Ciel and Cristal brands in Mexico as well as the Kinley brand in India, partially offset by a decline in the company's water brands in Japan. The decline in Japan was primarily due to deprioritization of low-margin commodity water brands. ◦ Tea and coffee volume declined 3% as growth in Fuze Tea across Europe and Mexico was offset by a decline in the doğadan tea business in Turkey, in addition to the company's tea brands in Japan. • Operating income grew 8% including a negative impact from currency. Comparable currency neutral operating income (non-GAAP) grew 14%. Operating income growth was driven by strong organic revenue (non-GAAP) growth, a benefit from acquisitions and ongoing productivity initiatives. Europe, Middle East & Africa • Price/mix grew 1% for the quarter, which included a 2-point headwind from geographic mix due to strong growth across key African markets, including South Africa and Nigeria. • Unit case volume grew 2%, as growth across the majority of markets was partially offset by declines in Zimbabwe and the Middle East. Growth was led by sparkling soft drinks and Fuze Tea. • Operating income declined 5%, primarily due to a 14-point currency headwind. Comparable currency neutral operating income (non-GAAP) grew 9%, primarily driven by organic revenue (non-GAAP) growth in addition to a benefit from the timing of expenses . • The company gained value share in total NARTD beverages, led by solid share performance across Europe, in addition to gaining share across all category clusters. Latin America • Price/mix grew 5% for the quarter, largely driven by strong performance in Mexico and Brazil, in addition to inflationary pricing in Argentina. • Unit case volume grew 1% as growth across the majority of key markets, led by Brazil and Mexico, was partially offset by a decline in Argentina. • Operating income declined 1%, which included a 13-point currency headwind. Comparable currency neutral operating income (non-GAAP) grew 12%. Operating income growth was largely driven by the benefit of strong pricing in the marketplace. • The company lost value share in total NARTD beverages as a gain in sparkling soft drinks was offset by a loss in packaged water. North America • Price/mix grew 4% for the quarter, driven by sparkling soft drinks. • Unit case volume declined 1% partially due to the impact of pricing and package initiatives executed in the marketplace, which is driving positive price/mix performance. Positive performance in trademark Coca-Cola was driven by double-digit growth in Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and innovation such as Coca-Cola Orange Vanilla. 4 • Operating income grew 10%. Comparable currency neutral operating income (non-GAAP) grew 4%. Growth was largely driven by favorable product mix, with sparkling soft drinks as the main driver. • The company gained value share in total NARTD beverages led by strong performance in sparkling soft drinks; water, enhanced water and sports drinks; and juice, dairy and plant-based beverages. Asia Pacific • Price/mix declined 3% for the quarter, largely driven by geographic mix due to growth in emerging and developing markets outpacing developed markets. • Unit case volume grew 7% due to broad-based growth across nearly all key markets.

Bottling Investments • During the quarter, the company announced that it will maintain its majority stake in Coca-Cola Beverages Africa (CCBA) for the foreseeable future. As a result, CCBA is now presented within the company’s results from continuing operations and is included in the Bottling Investments operating segment. • Price/mix grew 3% for the quarter, largely driven by solid performance from CCBA and the company's bottling operations in India. • Operating income was favorably impacted by comparability items and the acquisition of bottling operations in the Philippines. 5 Operating Review – Six Months Ended June 28, 2019 Revenues and Volume Percent Change Concentrate Sales 1 Price/Mix Currency Impact Acquisitions, Divestitures and Structural Items, Net Reported Net Revenues Organic Revenues 2 Unit Case Volume Consolidated 3 3 (6) 6 5 6 2 Europe, Middle East & Africa 4 5 (11) 3 0 9 2 Latin America 0 7 (13) 0 (6) 7 0 North America (2) 4 0 0 2 2 (1) Asia Pacific 7 (2) (3) (1) 0 4 7 Global Ventures 3 1 0 (20) 220 201 1 3 Bottling Investments 9 3 (8) (2) 3 13 23 Operating Income and EPS Percent Change Reported Operating Income Items Impacting Comparability Currency Impact Comparable Currency Neutral 2 Consolidated 15 11 (9) 14 Europe, Middle East & Africa 0 0 (14) 15 Latin America (7) 0 (16) 9 North America 13 7 0 6 Asia Pacific 1 0 (3) 3 Global Ventures 110 0 (6) 116 Bottling Investments — 4 — 4 64 372 Percent Change Reported EPS Items Impacting Comparability Currency Impact Comparable Currency Neutral 2 Consolidated 16 13 (9) 13 Note: Certain rows may not add due to rounding. 1 For Bottling Investments, this represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume computed based on total sales (rather than average daily sales) in each of the corresponding periods after considering the impact of structural changes. 2 Organic revenues, comparable currency neutral operating income and comparable currency neutral EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. Refer to the Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures section. 3 With the exception of RTD products, Costa sales are not included in concentrate sales, price/mix or unit case volume. 4 Reported operating income for the six months ended June 28, 2019 was $219 million. Reported operating loss for the six months ended June 29, 2018 was $342 million. Therefore, the percentages are not calculable. 6 Outlook The 2019 outlook information provided below includes forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, which management uses in measuring performance. The company is not able to reconcile full year 2019 projected organic revenues (non-GAAP) to full year 2019 projected reported net revenues, full year 2019 projected comparable currency neutral net revenues (non-GAAP) to full year 2019 projected reported net revenues, full year 2019 projected comparable currency neutral operating income (non-GAAP) to full year 2019 projected reported operating income, or full year 2019 projected comparable EPS (non-GAAP) to full year 2019 projected reported EPS without unreasonable efforts because it is not possible to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the actual impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates; the exact timing and amount of acquisitions, divestitures and/or structural changes; and the exact timing and amount of comparability items throughout 2019. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on full year 2019 GAAP financial results. Full Year 2019 Revenues: • 5% growth in organic revenues (non-GAAP) – Updated • 12% growth in comparable currency neutral net revenues (non-GAAP), including a 7% tailwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural items – Updated • Comparable net revenues (non-GAAP): 4% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions – Updated Full Year 2019 Operating Income: • 11% to 12% growth in comparable currency neutral operating income (non-GAAP), including a low single-digit tailwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural items – Updated • Comparable operating income (non-GAAP): 7% to 8% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions – Updated Full Year 2019 EPS: • -1% to 1% growth versus $2.08 in 2018 in comparable EPS (non-GAAP) – No Change Full Year 2019 Other Items: • Underlying effective tax rate (non-GAAP): Estimated to be 19.5% – No Change • Cash from operations: At least $8.5 billion – Updated • Capital expenditures: Approximately $2.4 billion – Updated • Net share repurchases (non-GAAP): Share repurchases to offset dilution from employee stock-based compensation plans – No Change Third Quarter 2019 Considerations – New : • Comparable net revenues (non-GAAP): 6% tailwind from acquisitions, divestitures and structural items; 3% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions • Comparable operating income (non-GAAP): 6% currency headwind based on the current rates and including the impact of hedged positions 7 Notes • All references to growth rate percentages and share compare the results of the period to those of the prior year comparable period. • All references to volume and volume percentage changes indicate unit case volume, unless otherwise noted. All volume percentage changes are computed based on average daily sales, unless otherwise noted. ""Unit case"" means a unit of measurement equal to 24 eight-ounce servings of finished beverage. ""Unit case volume"" means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of company beverages directly or indirectly sold by the company and its bottling partners to customers. • ""Concentrate sales"" represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, beverage bases, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in equivalent unit cases) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the company to its bottling partners or other customers. In the reconciliation of reported net revenues, ""concentrate sales"" represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in concentrate sales volume for the geographic operating segments and the Global Ventures operating segment (excluding Costa non-RTD sales) (expressed in equivalent unit cases) after considering the impact of structural changes. For the Bottling Investments operating segment, this represents the percent change in net revenues attributable to the increase (decrease) in unit case volume computed based on total sales (rather than average daily sales) in each of the corresponding periods after considering the impact of structural changes. The Bottling Investments operating segment reflects unit case volume growth for consolidated bottlers only. • ""Price/mix"" represents the change in net operating revenues caused by factors such as price changes, the mix of products and packages sold, and the mix of channels and geographic territories where the sales occurred. • First quarter 2019 financial results were impacted by one less day as compared to the same period in 2018, and fourth quarter 2019 financial results will be impacted by one additional day as compared to the same period in 2018. Unit case volume results for the quarters are not impacted by the variances in days due to the average daily sales computation referenced above. Conference Call The company is hosting a conference call with investors and analysts to discuss second quarter 2019 operating results today, July 23, 2019, at 8:30 a.m. ET. The company invites participants to listen to a live webcast of the conference call on the company’s website, http://www.coca-colacompany.com, in the ""Investors"" section.

During the six months ended June 29, 2018 , intersegment revenues were $273 million for Europe, Middle East & Africa, $38 million for Latin America, $124 million for North America, $224 million for Asia Pacific, $2 million for Global Ventures and $4 million for Bottling Investments. 14 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures (UNAUDITED) The company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""GAAP"" or referred to herein as ""reported""). To supplement our consolidated financial statements reported on a GAAP basis, we provide the following non-GAAP financial measures: ""comparable net revenues"", ""comparable currency neutral net revenues"", ""organic revenues"", ""comparable operating margin"", ""underlying operating margin"", ""comparable operating income"", ""comparable currency neutral operating income"", ""comparable EPS"", ""comparable currency neutral EPS"", ""underlying effective tax rate"", ""free cash flow"" and ""net share repurchases"", each of which are defined below. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with additional meaningful financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends. Further, management believes these non-GAAP financial measures also enhance investors' ability to compare period-to-period financial results. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the company's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures do not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. Therefore, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP information are also included. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating, compensation and planning decisions and in evaluating the company's performance. Disclosing these non-GAAP financial measures allows investors and company management to view our operating results excluding the impact of items that are not reflective of the underlying operating performance. DEFINITIONS • ""Currency neutral operating results"" are determined by dividing or multiplying, as appropriate, our current period actual U.S. dollar operating results, by the current period actual exchange rates (that include the impact of current period currency hedging activities), to derive our current period local currency operating results. We then multiply or divide, as appropriate, the derived current period local currency operating results by the foreign currency exchange rates (that also include the impact of the comparable prior period currency hedging activities) used to translate the company's financial statements in the comparable prior year period to determine what the current period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the foreign currency exchange rates had not changed from the comparable prior year period. • ""Structural changes"" generally refer to acquisitions and divestitures of bottling and distribution operations including the impact of intercompany transactions among our operating segments. In 2019, the company acquired bottling operations in Zambia. In 2018, the company acquired controlling interests in the Philippine bottling operations and Oman bottling operations, both of which were previously accounted for as equity method investees, as well as bottling operations in Botswana and Zambia. The impact of these acquisitions has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Europe, Middle East and Africa, Asia Pacific and Bottling Investments operating segments. In 2018, the company refranchised our Canadian and Latin American bottling operations. The impact of these refranchising activities has been included as a structural change in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the North America, Latin America and Bottling Investments operating segments. • ""Comparable net revenues"" is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability (discussed further below). ""Comparable currency neutral net revenues"" is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability (discussed further below) as well as the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Management believes the comparable net revenues (non-GAAP) growth measure and the comparable currency neutral net revenues (non‑GAAP) growth measure provide investors with useful supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the company's revenue performance and trends by improving their ability to compare our period-to-period results. ""Organic revenues"" is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and structural items, as applicable, and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Management believes the organic revenue (non-GAAP) growth measure provides users with useful supplemental information regarding the company's ongoing revenue performance and trends by presenting revenue growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange as well as the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and structural items. The adjustments related to acquisitions, divestitures and structural items for the three and six months ended June 28, 2019 and June 29, 2018 consisted of the structural changes discussed above. Additionally, in 2019, the 15 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures (UNAUDITED) company acquired Costa Limited (""Costa""). The impact of this acquisition has been included in acquisitions and divestitures in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Global Ventures operating segment. In 2019, the company also acquired the remaining equity interest in C.H.I. Limited (""CHI""). The impact of this acquisition has been included in acquisitions and divestitures in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the Europe, Middle East and Africa operating segment. • ""Comparable operating income"" is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability (discussed further below). ""Comparable currency neutral operating income"" is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability (discussed further below) and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. ""Comparable operating margin"" is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability (discussed further below). ""Underlying operating margin"" is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability (discussed further below), the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, and the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and structural items, as applicable. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the company's performance and make resource allocation decisions. Further, management believes the comparable operating income (non-GAAP) growth measure, comparable currency neutral operating income (non-GAAP) growth measure, comparable operating margin (non-GAAP) measure and underlying operating margin (non-GAAP) measure enhance its ability to communicate the underlying operating results and provide investors with useful supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the company's underlying business performance and trends by improving their ability to compare our period-to-period financial results. • ""Comparable EPS"" and ""comparable currency neutral EPS"" are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude or have otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability (discussed further below). Comparable currency neutral EPS (non-GAAP) has also been adjusted for the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the company's performance and make resource allocation decisions. Further, management believes the comparable EPS (non-GAAP) and comparable currency neutral EPS (non-GAAP) growth measures enhance its ability to communicate the underlying operating results and provide investors with useful supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the company's underlying business performance and trends by improving their ability to compare our period-to-period financial results. • ""Underlying effective tax rate"" is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents the estimated annual effective income tax rate on income before income taxes, which excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability (discussed further below). • ""Free cash flow"" is a non-GAAP financial measure that represents net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment. Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate the company's performance and make resource allocation decisions. • ""Net share repurchases"" is a non-GAAP financial measure that reflects the net amount of purchases of stock for treasury after considering proceeds from the issuances of stock, the net change in stock issuance receivables (related to employee stock options exercised but not settled prior to the end of the period) and the net change in treasury stock payables (for treasury shares repurchased but not settled prior to the end of the period). ITEMS IMPACTING COMPARABILITY The following information is provided to give qualitative and quantitative information related to items impacting comparability. Items impacting comparability are not defined terms within GAAP. Therefore, our non-GAAP financial information may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We determine which items to consider as ""items impacting comparability"" based on how management views our business; makes financial, operating, compensation and planning decisions; and evaluates the company's ongoing performance. Items such as charges, gains and accounting changes which are viewed by management as impacting only the current period or the comparable period, but not both, or as pertaining to different and unrelated underlying activities or events across comparable periods, are generally considered ""items impacting comparability."" Items impacting comparability include, but are not limited to, asset impairments, charges related to our productivity and reinvestment initiatives, and transaction 16 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures (UNAUDITED) gains/losses, in each case when exceeding a U.S. dollar threshold. Also included are our proportionate share of similar items incurred by our equity method investees, timing differences related to our economic (nondesignated) hedging activities, and timing differences related to unrealized mark-to-market adjustments of equity securities and trading debt securities, regardless of size. In addition, we provide the impact that changes in foreign currency exchange rates had on our financial results (""currency neutral operating results"" defined above). Asset Impairments During the three and six months ended June 28, 2019 , the company recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $49 million related to one of our equity method investees in Latin America. During the six months ended June 28, 2019 , the company recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $286 million related to Coca-Cola Bottlers Japan Holdings Inc. (""CCBJHI""), an equity method investee. Based on the length of time and the extent to which the market value of our investment in CCBJHI has been less than our carrying value and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer, management determined that the decline in fair value was other than temporary in nature. During the six months ended June 28, 2019 , we also recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $57 million related to one of our equity method investees in North America. This charge was primarily driven by revised projections of future operating results. During the three and six months ended June 29, 2018, the company recorded charges of $60 million and $450 million, respectively, related to the impairment of Coca-Cola Refreshments (""CCR"") assets that are recorded in our Bottling Investments operating segment, primarily as a result of management's view of the proceeds that are expected to be received for the remaining bottling territories upon their refranchising. These charges were determined by comparing the fair values of the assets to their carrying values. The company also recorded an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $52 million during the three and six months ended June 29, 2018 related to one of our equity method investees in Latin America. Productivity and Reinvestment During the three and six months ended June 28, 2019 , the company recorded charges of $55 million and $123 million, respectively, related to our productivity and reinvestment initiatives. During the three and six months ended June 29, 2018 , the company recorded charges of $150 million and $245 million, respectively, which included $39 million due to pension settlements. These initiatives are focused on four key areas: restructuring the company's global supply chain; implementing zero-based work, an evolution of zero-based budget principles across the organization; streamlining and simplifying the company's operating model; and further driving increased discipline and efficiency in direct marketing investments. Under this operating model, our business units will be supported by an expanded enabling services organization and a corporate center focused on a few strategic initiatives, policy and governance. The expanded enabling services organization will focus on both simplifying and standardizing key transactional processes and providing support to business units through global centers of excellence. The savings realized from the program will enable the company to fund marketing initiatives and innovation required to deliver sustainable net revenue growth. The savings will also support margin expansion and increased returns on invested capital over time. Equity Investees During the three and six months ended June 28, 2019 , the company recorded net charges of $26 million and $68 million, respectively. During the three and six months ended June 29, 2018 , the company recorded net charges of $33 million and $84 million, respectively. These amounts represent the company’s proportionate share of significant operating and nonoperating items recorded by certain of our equity method investees. Transaction Gains/Losses During the three and six months ended June 28, 2019 , the company recorded an adjustment to reduce the carrying amount of Coca-Cola Beverages Africa's (""CCBA"") fixed assets and definite-lived intangible assets by $160 million as a result of the company's change in plans for CCBA as it now intends to maintain its controlling stake in CCBA for the foreseeable future. During the three and six months ended June 28, 2019 , the company recorded charges of $29 million and $40 million, respectively, primarily related to costs incurred to refranchise certain of our North America bottling operations. The 17 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures (UNAUDITED) company also recorded charges of $34 million and $79 million during the three and six months ended June 29, 2018 , respectively. These costs include, among other items, internal and external costs for individuals directly working on the refranchising efforts, severance, special termination benefits, and costs associated with the implementation of information technology systems to facilitate consistent data standards and availability throughout our bottling systems. During the six months ended June 28, 2019 , the company recorded charges of $4 million related to North America refranchising. During the three and six months ended June 29, 2018 , the company recorded net charges of $102 million and $104 million, respectively. These net charges were primarily related to post-closing adjustments as contemplated by the related agreements. During the six months ended June 28, 2019 , the company recorded charges of $4 million. During the three and six months ended June 29, 2018 , the company recorded charges of $2 million and $21 million, respectively. These charges were primarily related to payments made to certain of our unconsolidated bottling partners in North America in order to convert their bottling agreements to a comprehensive beverage agreement with additional requirements. During the three and six months ended June 28, 2019 , the company recorded charges of $8 million. The company also recorded charges of $3 million during the three and six months ended June 29, 2018 . These charges were for noncapitalizable transaction costs associated with pending and closed transactions. During the six months ended June 28, 2019 , the company recognized a $121 million loss in conjunction with our acquisition of the remaining equity ownership interest in CHI, which included the remeasurement of our previously held equity interest in CHI to fair value and the reversal of the related cumulative translation adjustments. During the six months ended June 28, 2019 , the company incurred $46 million of transaction costs associated with the purchase of Costa, which we acquired in January 2019. During the six months ended June 28, 2019 , the company recorded a gain of $39 million related to the sale of a portion of our equity ownership interest in Embotelladora Andina S.A. (""Andina""). During the three and six months ended June 29, 2018, the company recorded charges of $47 million due to pension settlements. During the three and six months ended June 29, 2018 , the company recorded a net gain of $36 million due to the refranchising of our Latin American bottling operations. During the six months ended June 29, 2018 , the company recorded a net loss of $33 million primarily related to the reversal of the cumulative translation adjustments resulting from the substantial liquidation of the company's former Russian juice operations. CCBA Unrecognized Depreciation and Amortization These amounts represent the depreciation and amortization that the company would have recorded during the periods presented had CCBA not been classified as held for sale. Other Items Economic (Nondesignated) Hedges The company uses derivatives as economic hedges primarily to mitigate the foreign exchange risk for certain currencies and the price risk associated with the purchase of materials used in the manufacturing process as well as the purchase of vehicle fuel. Although these derivatives were not designated and/or did not qualify for hedge accounting, they are effective economic hedges. The changes in fair values of these economic hedges are immediately recognized into earnings. The company excludes the net impact of mark-to-market adjustments for outstanding hedges and realized gains/losses for settled hedges from our non-GAAP financial information until the period in which the underlying exposure being hedged impacts our condensed consolidated statement of income. Management believes this adjustment provides meaningful information related to the impact of our economic hedging activities. During the three and six months ended June 28, 2019 , the net impact of the company's adjustment related to our economic hedging activities resulted in an increase of $9 million and a decrease of $10 million, respectively, to our non-GAAP income before income taxes. 18 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures (UNAUDITED) During the three and six months ended June 29, 2018 , the net impact of the company's adjustment related to our economic hedging activities resulted in decreases of $22 million and $32 million, respectively, to our non-GAAP income before income taxes. Unrealized Gains and Losses on Equity and Trading Debt Securities The company excludes the net impact of unrealized gains and losses resulting from mark-to-market adjustments on our equity and trading debt securities from our non-GAAP financial information until the period in which the underlying securities are sold and the associated gains or losses are realized. Management believes this adjustment provides meaningful information related to the impact of our investments in equity and trading debt securities. During the three and six months ended June 28, 2019 , the net impact of the company's adjustment related to unrealized gains and losses on our equity and trading debt securities resulted in an increase of $23 million and a decrease of $138 million, respectively, to our non-GAAP income before income taxes. During the three and six months ended June 29, 2018 , the net impact of the company's adjustment related to unrealized gains and losses on our equity and trading debt securities resulted in a decrease of $25 million and an increase of $72 million, respectively, to our non-GAAP income before income taxes. Other During the six months ended June 28, 2019 , the company recorded other charges of $2 million related to tax litigation expense. During the three and six months ended June 29, 2018 , the company recorded other charges of $22 million and $27 million, respectively. These charges were primarily related to tax litigation expense. Certain Tax Matters and Tax Reform Certain Tax Matters During the three and six months ended June 28, 2019 , the company recorded $108 million and $135 million, respectively, related to excess tax benefits associated with the company's share-based compensation arrangements and the reversal of a U.S. state valuation allowance. During the three and six months ended June 28, 2019 , the excess tax benefits were partially offset by net tax charges of $98 million and $103 million, respectively, for changes to our uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, as well as for agreed-upon tax matters. During the three and six months ended June 29, 2018 , the company recorded $42 million of income tax benefit and $134 million of income tax expense, respectively, primarily as a result of adjustments to our provisional remeasurement of deferred taxes recorded as of December 31, 2017 related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""Tax Reform Act"") signed into law on December 22, 2017. During the three and six months ended June 29, 2018 , the company also recorded net tax charges of $8 million and $42 million, respectively, for changes to our uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties, as well as for agreed-upon tax matters. In addition, during the three and six months ended June 29, 2018 , the company recorded $3 million and $87 million, respectively, of excess tax benefits associated with the company's share‑based compensation arrangements. 2019 OUTLOOK The 2019 outlook information provided in this earnings release includes forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures, which management uses in measuring performance. The company is not able to reconcile full year 2019 projected organic revenues (non-GAAP) to full year 2019 projected reported net revenues, full year 2019 projected comparable currency neutral net revenues (non-GAAP) to full year 2019 projected reported net revenues, full year 2019 projected comparable currency neutral operating income (non-GAAP) to full year 2019 projected reported operating income, or full year 2019 projected comparable EPS (non-GAAP) to full year 2019 projected reported EPS without unreasonable efforts because it is not possible to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty the actual impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates; the exact timing and amount of acquisitions, divestitures and/or structural changes; and the exact timing and amount of comparability items throughout 2019. The unavailable information could have a significant impact on full year 2019 GAAP financial results. 19 THE COCA-COLA COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures (UNAUDITED) (In millions except per share data) Three Months Ended June 28, 2019 Net operating revenues Cost of goods sold Gross profit Gross margin Selling, general and administrative expenses Other operating charges Operating income Operating margin Reported (GAAP) $ 9,997 $ 3,921 $ 6,076 60.8 % $ 2,996 $ 92 $ 2,988 29.9 % Items Impacting Comparability: Asset Impairments — — — — — — Productivity and Reinvestment — — — — (55 ) 55 Equity Investees — — — — — — Transaction Gains/Losses — — — — (37 ) 37 CCBA Unrecognized Depreciation and Amortization — 16 (16 ) 44 — (60 ) Other Items — (10 ) 10 — — 10 Certain Tax Matters — — — — — — Comparable (Non-GAAP) $ 9,997 $ 3,927 $ 6,070 60.7 % $ 3,040 $ — $ 3,030 30.3 % Three Months Ended June 29, 2018 Net operating revenues Cost of goods sold Gross profit Gross margin Selling, general and administrative expenses Other operating charges Operating income Operating margin Reported (GAAP) $ 9,421 $ 3,543 $ 5,878 62.4 % $ 2,887 $ 225 $ 2,766 29.4 % Items Impacting Comparability: Asset Impairments — — — — (60 ) 60 Productivity and Reinvestment — — — — (111 ) 111 Equity Investees — — — — — — Transaction Gains/Losses — — — — (37 ) 37 CCBA Unrecognized Depreciation and Amortization — 24 (24 ) 73 — (97 ) Other Items (24 ) (1 ) (23 ) (1 ) (17 ) (5 ) Certain Tax Matters — — — — — — Comparable (Non-GAAP) $ 9,397 $ 3,566 $ 5,831 62.0 % $ 2,959 $ — $ 2,872 30.6 % Net operating revenues Cost of goods sold Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Other operating charges Operating income % Change — Reported (GAAP) 6 11 3 4 (59) 8 % Currency Impact (6) (4) (7) (5) — (10) % Change — Currency Neutral (Non-GAAP) 12 14 10 9 — 18 % Change — Comparable (Non-GAAP) 6 10 4 3 — 6 % Comparable Currency Impact (Non-GAAP) (6) (4) (7) (5) — (8) % Change — Comparable Currency Neutral (Non-GAAP) 12 14 11 8 — 14 Note: Certain columns may not add due to rounding.

Coca-Cola Beverages Africa Proprietary Limited (“CCBA”) has been accounted for as a discontinued operation of The Coca-Cola Company (the “company”) since the company became the controlling shareowner of CCBA in October 2017, due to the company’s original intent to refranchise CCBA. CCBA continued to meet the criteria for being classified as a discontinued operation until the company updated its plans for CCBA in the second quarter of 2019. The company now intends to maintain its majority stake in CCBA for the foreseeable future. As a result, the company will begin presenting the financial results of CCBA within its results from continuing operations in the second quarter of 2019. Therefore, the financial results for prior periods have been retrospectively reclassified herein. CCBA will be included in the company’s Bottling Investments operating segment. Attached as Exhibit 99.1 is a schedule of unaudited reclassified financial data on a consolidated basis, as well as for the company’s operating segments and Corporate, reflecting the change described above.

To supplement our financial results reported on a GAAP basis, we provide the following non-GAAP financial measures: ""comparable net revenues"", ""comparable operating income"" and ""comparable EPS,"" each of which are defined below. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with additional meaningful financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures also enhance investors' ability to compare period-to-period financial results. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the company's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures do not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. Therefore, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP information are also included. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating, compensation and planning decisions and in evaluating the company's performance. Disclosing these non-GAAP financial measures allows investors and company management to view our operating results excluding the impact of items that are not reflective of the underlying operating performance. DEFINITIONS • ""Comparable net revenues"" is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability (discussed further below). Management believes the comparable net revenues (non-GAAP) measure provides investors with useful supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the company's revenue performance and trends by improving their ability to compare our period-to-period results. • ""Comparable operating income"" is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability (discussed further below). Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate the company's performance and make resource allocation decisions. Further, management believes the comparable operating income (non-GAAP) measure enhances its ability to communicate the underlying operating results and provides investors with useful supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the company's underlying business performance and trends by improving their ability to compare our period-to-period financial results. • ""Comparable EPS"" is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability (discussed further below). Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate the company's performance and make resource allocation decisions. Further, management believes the comparable EPS (non-GAAP) measure enhances its ability to communicate the underlying operating results and provides investors with useful supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the company's underlying business performance and trends by improving their ability to compare our period-to-period financial results. ITEMS IMPACTING COMPARABILITY The following information is provided to give qualitative and quantitative information related to items impacting comparability. Items impacting comparability are not defined terms within GAAP. Therefore, our non-GAAP financial information may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We determine which items to consider as ""items impacting comparability"" based on how management views our business; makes financial, operating, compensation and planning decisions; and evaluates the company's ongoing performance. Items such as charges, gains and accounting changes which are viewed by management as impacting only the current period or the comparable period, but not both, or as pertaining to different and unrelated underlying activities or events across comparable periods, are generally considered ""items impacting comparability."" Items impacting comparability include, but are not limited to, asset impairments, charges related to our productivity and reinvestment initiatives, and transaction gains/losses, in each case when exceeding a U.S. dollar threshold. Also included are our proportionate share of similar items incurred by our equity method investees, timing differences related to our economic (nondesignated) hedging activities, and timing differences related to unrealized mark-to-market adjustments of equity securities and trading debt securities, regardless of size. 6 Exhibit 99.1 The Coca-Cola Company and Subsidiaries Reclassified Data within Statements of Income Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures Unaudited Productivity and Reinvestment During the periods presented, the company incurred costs related to our productivity and reinvestment initiatives. These initiatives are focused on four key areas: restructuring the company's global supply chain; implementing zero-based work, an evolution of zero-based budget principles across the organization; streamlining and simplifying the company's operating model; and further driving increased discipline and efficiency in direct marketing investments. The savings realized from the program will enable the company to fund marketing initiatives and innovation required to deliver sustainable net revenue growth. The savings will also support margin expansion and increased returns on invested capital over time. Equity Investees During the periods presented, the company recorded net charges or net gains representing the company's proportionate share of significant operating and nonoperating items recorded by certain of our equity method investees. Transaction Gains/Losses Transaction gains/losses represent the gains and losses the company incurs when acquiring or divesting of certain operations and investments. North America Refranchising Throughout the periods presented, the company refranchised its North America bottling territories to certain of its bottling partners. In conjunction with these refranchising transactions, the company incurred net losses, primarily related to the derecognition of the intangible assets transferred or reclassified as held for sale during the periods and certain post-closing adjustments. The company also incurred certain costs to refranchise these bottling territories. These costs include, among other items, internal and external costs for individuals directly working on the refranchising efforts, severance, special termination benefits, and costs associated with the implementation of information technology systems to facilitate consistent data standards and availability throughout our bottling system (""North America refranchising costs""). The company also made payments to certain of our unconsolidated bottling partners in North America in order to convert their bottling agreements to a comprehensive beverage agreement with additional requirements (""North America conversion costs""). CCBA Unrecognized Depreciation and Amortization These amounts represent the depreciation and amortization that the company would have recorded during the periods presented had CCBA not been classified as held for sale. Other Items Economic (Nondesignated) Hedges The company uses derivatives as economic hedges primarily to mitigate the foreign exchange risk for certain currencies and the price risk associated with the purchase of materials used in the manufacturing process as well as the purchase of vehicle fuel. Although these derivatives were not designated and/or did not qualify for hedge accounting, they are effective economic hedges. The changes in fair values of these economic hedges are immediately recognized into earnings. The company excludes the net impact of mark-to-market adjustments for outstanding hedges and realized gains/losses for settled hedges from our non-GAAP financial information until the period in which the underlying exposure being hedged impacts our condensed consolidated statement of income. Management believes this adjustment provides meaningful information related to the impact of our economic hedging activities. Unrealized Gains and Losses on Equity and Trading Debt Securities The company excludes the net impact of unrealized gains and losses resulting from mark-to-market adjustments on our equity and trading debt securities from our non-GAAP financial information until the period in which the underlying securities are sold and the associated gains or losses are realized. Management believes this adjustment provides meaningful information related to the impact of our investments in equity and trading debt securities. 7 Exhibit 99.1 The Coca-Cola Company and Subsidiaries Reclassified Data within Statements of Income Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures Unaudited (In millions except per share data) Three Months Ended March 29, 2019 Net operating revenues Cost of goods sold Gross profit Gross margin Selling, general and administrative expenses Other operating charges Operating income Operating margin Reported (GAAP) $ 8,694 $ 3,365 $ 5,329 61.3 % $ 2,767 $ 127 $ 2,435 28.0 % Items Impacting Comparability: Productivity and Reinvestment — — — — (68 ) 68 Transaction Gains/Losses — — — — (57 ) 57 CCBA Unrecognized Depreciation and Amortization — 23 (23 ) 65 — (88 ) Other Items 4 22 (18 ) — (2 ) (16 ) Comparable (Non-GAAP) $ 8,698 $ 3,410 $ 5,288 60.8 % $ 2,832 $ — $ 2,456 28.2 % Three Months Ended March 29, 2019 Interest expense Equity income (loss) — net Other income (loss) — net Income before income taxes Income taxes 1 Effective tax rate Net income 2 Diluted net income per share Reported (GAAP) $ 245 $ 133 $ (231 ) $ 2,225 $ 522 23.5 % $ 1,678 $ 0.39 Items Impacting Comparability: Asset Impairments — — 343 343 36 307 0.07 Productivity and Reinvestment — — — 68 16 52 0.01 Equity Investees — 42 — 42 1 41 0.01 Transaction Gains/Losses — — 90 147 (23 ) 170 0.04 CCBA Unrecognized Depreciation and Amortization — — — (88 ) (25 ) (40 ) (0.01 ) Other Items — — (162 ) (178 ) (40 ) (138 ) (0.03 ) Certain Tax Matters — — — — 22 (22 ) (0.01 ) Comparable (Non-GAAP) $ 245 $ 175 $ 40 $ 2,559 $ 509 19.9 % $ 2,048 $ 0.48 Note: Certain columns may not add due to rounding.

The company now intends to maintain its majority stake in CCBA for the foreseeable future. As a result, the company will begin presenting the financial results of CCBA within its results from continuing operations in the second quarter of 2019. Therefore, the financial results for prior periods have been retrospectively reclassified herein. CCBA will be included in the company’s Bottling Investments operating segment.

CCBA is included in the Bottling Investments operating segment. 5 Exhibit 99.1 The Coca-Cola Company and Subsidiaries Reclassified Data within Statements of Income Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures Unaudited The company reports its financial results in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""GAAP"" or referred to herein as ""reported""). To supplement our financial results reported on a GAAP basis, we provide the following non-GAAP financial measures: ""comparable net revenues"", ""comparable operating income"" and ""comparable EPS,"" each of which are defined below. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with additional meaningful financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends. Management believes these non-GAAP financial measures also enhance investors' ability to compare period-to-period financial results. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the company's reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures do not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. Therefore, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP information are also included. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in making financial, operating, compensation and planning decisions and in evaluating the company's performance. Disclosing these non-GAAP financial measures allows investors and company management to view our operating results excluding the impact of items that are not reflective of the underlying operating performance. DEFINITIONS • ""Comparable net revenues"" is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability (discussed further below). Management believes the comparable net revenues (non-GAAP) measure provides investors with useful supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the company's revenue performance and trends by improving their ability to compare our period-to-period results. • ""Comparable operating income"" is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability (discussed further below). Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate the company's performance and make resource allocation decisions. Further, management believes the comparable operating income (non-GAAP) measure enhances its ability to communicate the underlying operating results and provides investors with useful supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the company's underlying business performance and trends by improving their ability to compare our period-to-period financial results. • ""Comparable EPS"" is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes or has otherwise been adjusted for items impacting comparability (discussed further below). Management uses this non-GAAP financial measure to evaluate the company's performance and make resource allocation decisions. Further, management believes the comparable EPS (non-GAAP) measure enhances its ability to communicate the underlying operating results and provides investors with useful supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the company's underlying business performance and trends by improving their ability to compare our period-to-period financial results. ITEMS IMPACTING COMPARABILITY The following information is provided to give qualitative and quantitative information related to items impacting comparability. Items impacting comparability are not defined terms within GAAP. Therefore, our non-GAAP financial information may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We determine which items to consider as ""items impacting comparability"" based on how management views our business; makes financial, operating, compensation and planning decisions; and evaluates the company's ongoing performance. Items such as charges, gains and accounting changes which are viewed by management as impacting only the current period or the comparable period, but not both, or as pertaining to different and unrelated underlying activities or events across comparable periods, are generally considered ""items impacting comparability."" Items impacting comparability include, but are not limited to, asset impairments, charges related to our productivity and reinvestment initiatives, and transaction gains/losses, in each case when exceeding a U.S. dollar threshold. Also included are our proportionate share of similar items incurred by our equity method investees, timing differences related to our economic (nondesignated) hedging activities, and timing differences related to unrealized mark-to-market adjustments of equity securities and trading debt securities, regardless of size. 6 Exhibit 99.1 The Coca-Cola Company and Subsidiaries Reclassified Data within Statements of Income Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures Unaudited Productivity and Reinvestment During the periods presented, the company incurred costs related to our productivity and reinvestment initiatives. These initiatives are focused on four key areas: restructuring the company's global supply chain; implementing zero-based work, an evolution of zero-based budget principles across the organization; streamlining and simplifying the company's operating model; and further driving increased discipline and efficiency in direct marketing investments. The savings realized from the program will enable the company to fund marketing initiatives and innovation required to deliver sustainable net revenue growth. The savings will also support margin expansion and increased returns on invested capital over time. Equity Investees During the periods presented, the company recorded net charges or net gains representing the company's proportionate share of significant operating and nonoperating items recorded by certain of our equity method investees. Transaction Gains/Losses Transaction gains/losses represent the gains and losses the company incurs when acquiring or divesting of certain operations and investments. North America Refranchising Throughout the periods presented, the company refranchised its North America bottling territories to certain of its bottling partners. In conjunction with these refranchising transactions, the company incurred net losses, primarily related to the derecognition of the intangible assets transferred or reclassified as held for sale during the periods and certain post-closing adjustments. The company also incurred certain costs to refranchise these bottling territories. These costs include, among other items, internal and external costs for individuals directly working on the refranchising efforts, severance, special termination benefits, and costs associated with the implementation of information technology systems to facilitate consistent data standards and availability throughout our bottling system (""North America refranchising costs""). The company also made payments to certain of our unconsolidated bottling partners in North America in order to convert their bottling agreements to a comprehensive beverage agreement with additional requirements (""North America conversion costs""). CCBA Unrecognized Depreciation and Amortization These amounts represent the depreciation and amortization that the company would have recorded during the periods presented had CCBA not been classified as held for sale. Other Items Economic (Nondesignated) Hedges The company uses derivatives as economic hedges primarily to mitigate the foreign exchange risk for certain currencies and the price risk associated with the purchase of materials used in the manufacturing process as well as the purchase of vehicle fuel. Although these derivatives were not designated and/or did not qualify for hedge accounting, they are effective economic hedges. The changes in fair values of these economic hedges are immediately recognized into earnings. The company excludes the net impact of mark-to-market adjustments for outstanding hedges and realized gains/losses for settled hedges from our non-GAAP financial information until the period in which the underlying exposure being hedged impacts our condensed consolidated statement of income. Management believes this adjustment provides meaningful information related to the impact of our economic hedging activities. Unrealized Gains and Losses on Equity and Trading Debt Securities The company excludes the net impact of unrealized gains and losses resulting from mark-to-market adjustments on our equity and trading debt securities from our non-GAAP financial information until the period in which the underlying securities are sold and the associated gains or losses are realized. Management believes this adjustment provides meaningful information related to the impact of our investments in equity and trading debt securities. 7 Exhibit 99.1 The Coca-Cola Company and Subsidiaries Reclassified Data within Statements of Income Reconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Financial Measures Unaudited (In millions except per share data) Three Months Ended March 29, 2019 Net operating revenues Cost of goods sold Gross profit Gross margin Selling, general and administrative expenses Other operating charges Operating income Operating margin Reported (GAAP) $ 8,694 $ 3,365 $ 5,329 61.3 % $ 2,767 $ 127 $ 2,435 28.0 % Items Impacting Comparability: Productivity and Reinvestment — — — — (68 ) 68 Transaction Gains/Losses — — — — (57 ) 57 CCBA Unrecognized Depreciation and Amortization — 23 (23 ) 65 — (88 ) Other Items 4 22 (18 ) — (2 ) (16 ) Comparable (Non-GAAP) $ 8,698 $ 3,410 $ 5,288 60.8 % $ 2,832 $ — $ 2,456 28.2 % Three Months Ended March 29, 2019 Interest expense Equity income (loss) — net Other income (loss) — net Income before income taxes Income taxes 1 Effective tax rate Net income 2 Diluted net income per share Reported (GAAP) $ 245 $ 133 $ (231 ) $ 2,225 $ 522 23.5 % $ 1,678 $ 0.39 Items Impacting Comparability: Asset Impairments — — 343 343 36 307 0.07 Productivity and Reinvestment — — — 68 16 52 0.01 Equity Investees — 42 — 42 1 41 0.01 Transaction Gains/Losses — — 90 147 (23 ) 170 0.04 CCBA Unrecognized Depreciation and Amortization — — — (88 ) (25 ) (40 ) (0.01 ) Other Items — — (162 ) (178 ) (40 ) (138 ) (0.03 ) Certain Tax Matters — — — — 22 (22 ) (0.01 ) Comparable (Non-GAAP) $ 245 $ 175 $ 40 $ 2,559 $ 509 19.9 % $ 2,048 $ 0.48 Note: Certain columns may not add due to rounding.
