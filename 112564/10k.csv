Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), are made available free of charge through our website, www.gentherm.com , as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file them with or furnish them to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). These reports are also available on the SEC’s website, www.sec.gov . Impact of Supply Chain Disruptions and Other Matters Our sales are driven by the number of vehicles produced by the automotive manufacturers, which is ultimately dependent on consumer demand for automotive vehicles, and our content per vehicle, and other factors that may limit or otherwise impact production by us, our supply chain and our customers. According to the forecasting firm S&P Global Mobility (February 2023 release), global light vehicle production in 2022 in the Company’s key markets of North America, Europe, China, Japan and Korea, was up 4.7%, as compared to 2021. The production growth in 2022 primarily is due to the significant decrease in vehicle production in 2020 that was driven by the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic continuing into 2021, and the impacts of the 2021 global supply chain disruptions, including the worldwide semiconductor supply shortage. In 2022 and 2021, the Company's semiconductor suppliers, along with most automotive component supply companies that use semiconductors, including Gentherm, were unable to fully meet the vehicle production demands of the OEMs largely due to events outside the control of the Company and its suppliers and customers, as well as the automotive industry generally. Supply shortages of semiconductor chips and other components not only resulted in decreased global automotive vehicle production but also caused significant volatility in customer vehicle production schedules. Sudden changes in the production schedules of OEMs and Tier 1s resulted in operating inefficiencies that adversely affected our profitability and results of operations. In addition, we experienced inflationary cost increases in certain component parts, raw materials, labor and transportation as a result of the supply-constrained environment and general economic conditions. While these broad-based operational and inflationary impacts are easing, they continued to impact the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows as of this filing. In response to the global supply chain instability and inflationary cost increases, the Company has taken several actions to reduce any potential and actual adverse impacts by working closely with its suppliers and customers to closely monitor the availability of semiconductor microchips and other component parts and raw materials, customer vehicle production schedules and any other supply chain inefficiencies that may arise. We expect global supply chain instability will continue to have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance for the foreseeable future, and such adverse impact may be material. The consequences of macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions, global supply chain instability and inflationary cost increases and their adverse impact to the global economy continue to evolve. Accordingly, the significance of the future adverse impact on our business and financial statements remains subject to significant uncertainty. See further discussion of risks in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report.

Core Technologies In Automotive, Gentherm is the global market leader of innovative thermal management and pneumatic comfort technologies. For our Medical business, our expertise in thermal management is focused on managing the thermal conditions of people. ClimateSense® ClimateSense® is an integrated comfort system we are designing to create a personalized microclimate for passengers using localized convective, conductive and radiative heating and cooling products. Using automatic regulation technology in combination with our unique occupant-centric control algorithm, ClimateSense® offers the ability to personalize and improve overall occupant thermal comfort, improve time to comfort with (all-electric) pre-conditioning, provide comfort with less energy consumption thereby lowering greenhouse gas emissions by conventional internal combustion and hybrid powertrains, and extend range for electrified powertrains through a reduction in central heating, ventilation and air conditioning (“HVAC”) system usage. In July 2021, we received the first production vehicle award for our ClimateSense® technology that will launch on the all-new 2024 Cadillac CELESTIQ. In June 2022, we received our second ClimateSense® technology award on a battery electric version of a popular SUV launching in 2025 and is a strong validation of the progress we are making with General Motors. Electronics The electronics in our core climate comfort solution products are manufactured by us. We also supply value-added electronic products to third parties for adjacent areas within the automotive interior. In addition, Gentherm manufacturers and supplies electronic control units for memory seat modules that include electric motor position sensing technology. This technology further applies to other automotive products requiring fine motor controls. Air Moving Devices Our highly durable and quiet air moving devices, some of which include our proprietary blower and fan designs, are essential to all of our products that require air movement. We have a broad portfolio of these products that are tailored to various automotive applications, including seat ventilation and electric vehicle battery cooling. 7 Thermoelectric Technologies Many of our thermal products manage the thermal conditions of people using our internally developed advanced thermoelectric device technology (“TED”). A TED is a solid-state circuit that has the capability to produce both hot and cold thermal conditions by use of the Peltier effect. The advantages of advanced TED over conventional compressed gas systems include a reduced environmental impact and less complexity as they have no moving parts and are compact and light weight. Our work on this technology has yielded improvements in areas of functionality, efficiency, durability and performance. Resistive Heaters Resistive heater technologies are comprised of wire, carbon fiber or positive thermal coefficient (“PTC”) heating elements that quickly and effectively deliver heat to people and objects. Wire heating elements are designed from stainless steel, copper, our proprietary carbon fiber woven lattice technology called Carbotex® or printed circuit PTC heaters based on the specifications for a particular product application. Resistive heaters have multiple automotive applications, including seat heating, steering wheel heating, interior panel heating and battery heating. Pneumatic Pneumatic massage and lumbar operate by inflation and deflation of air bladders to achieve desired comfort effect. Our products' differentiation is that our underlying technology is based on shape memory alloy valves (""SMA""). Gentherm has developed actuators and valves with SMA technology that replace heavy, noisy and less accurate electromagnetic valves. Our innovative control elements produce precise mechanical forces and movements using the finest wires made of memory metals and without the labor-intensive use of additional sensors. Products Climate Comfort Solutions – Seat Comfort CCS Gentherm offers a range of CCS products utilizing proprietary technologies for regulating temperature and enhancing the comfort of vehicle passengers. Our ventilated CCS products move air through the seat to provide conditioning. Our active CCS products utilize TEDs to heat and cool air used to condition the seat. The conditioning air circulates by one of our specially designed air moving devices through an air distribution system installed in the seat cushion and seat back, so that the seat surface can be heated, ventilated or cooled. Each seat has individual electronic controls to adjust the level of heating, ventilating or cooling. Our CCS products improve comfort compared with conventional vehicle cabin air conditioners by focusing heating and cooling directly on the passenger through the seat. Our CCS products can be combined with our resistive heating elements to increase heating capacity and reduce time to comfort. By offering different models of the CCS product, our customers have the opportunity to purchase a wider range of climate control products at different price points. Sales of CCS products, primarily ventilated CCS products, contributed 35%, 38% and 38% to our total product revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Heated Seat Heated seats, based on our resistive heater core technology, are seamlessly integrated into automotive seat designs, and are constructed using materials that offer the best capacity, installation characteristics and durability. Our design and manufacturing capabilities allow customers to choose among a variety of resistive heater materials based on their individual vehicle specifications. Sales of heated seat products contributed 24%, 26% and 27% to our total product revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Intelligent Neck Conditioner Intelligent neck conditioning systems ventilate warm or temperature-controlled air directly onto the passenger’s neck and shoulder area. The system combines electronics, air moving device technologies and a heating element into a compact, integrated headrest design that can be adjusted to suit the body size of the passenger. 8 Climate Comfort Solutions – Surface Climate Control Systems Heated Steering Wheel Heated steering wheels deliver heating comfort to automobile drivers through resistive elements. This product can be applied to both leather and wood steering wheels. A solution for drivers in cold and mild weather climates, the heated steering wheel is designed for the global automotive market. Heated Surfaces Gentherm’s thermally conductive or radiative surfaces, such as door panel armrest and center console armrest products, are powered by our core technologies. The system is thermally managed by a heating control system which can be discretely located in the door panel or seat of the vehicle. Heated door panels and armrests complement our climate-controlled seat and steering wheel products and provide a superior level of thermal comfort to the driving experience. Pneumatic Seat Massage Gentherm's seat ergonomics system consists primarily of pneumatic lifting elements (air bladders) which are mounted under the surface of seat cushion and back. Through the cyclical inflation and deflation of the lifting elements, the contour of the seat cushion is selectively modified. The lifting elements are controlled by valves, utilizing software that can be enabled in modes by the vehicle occupant in accordance with their preferences and specific body types. Electronics Solutions Memory Seat Modules Gentherm has developed a unique way to control certain electrical motors in a vehicle. Our Intelligent Positioning System, IPS ® product suite utilizes proprietary software to determine the position of a power seat and control the memory seat module. Hands-On Detection All vehicles manufactured with autonomous driving level 2 or higher capabilities are required to ensure that the driver stays in control of the vehicle during operation. In order to accomplish this task, Gentherm developed PilotSense TM – a sensor integrated into the steering wheel that monitors whether the driver’s hands are maintaining contact with the steering wheel. This product is available for both heated and non-heated steering wheels. Battery Performance Solutions Cell Connecting Systems Cell connecting systems provide secure connections between advanced automotive batteries to transmit a continuous flow of information about battery temperature and cell voltage during the charging and discharging process to monitor battery system performance. Gentherm has developed a range of cell connecting system products, including flexible foil cell connecting boards that offer improved packaging, weight and functionality. We offer these products in a variety of materials to cover customers’ requirements. Thermoelectric Battery Thermal Management Thermal management is critically important for the long-term operation of advanced automotive batteries. The expansion of electrified vehicle applications, such as electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids and mild hybrids, have increased the demand for battery thermal management (“BTM”) systems that enable wider operating temperature ranges, enhanced driving range and prolonged life of the battery. Gentherm’s BTM system can provide precision battery cooling of 48-volt mild hybrid systems on pack or cell-level using patented TED technology. The BTM system maintains the temperature of the lithium-ion battery or other advanced chemistry battery within an acceptable temperature range without the use of chilled liquids or refrigerant loops, making it a light weight, highly scalable, compact solution ideal for automotive applications. Gentherm’s proprietary BTM system is compact and energy efficient, resulting in a minimal energy usage, which is important for an electrified vehicle. Aside from battery cooling, Gentherm’s BTM portfolio includes battery heating applications. Based on our proprietary technology, we offer solutions to our customers that enable efficient heating of lithium-ion batteries for most electrified vehicles. 9 Climate Comfort Solutions – Thermal Convenience TrueTherm TM Cup Holder The TrueTherm TM Cup Holder applies Gentherm’s patented TED technologies to keep beverages of automobile drivers and passengers either warm or cool. We have developed a range of cup holder models with varying degrees of functionality, designed to be manufactured in multiple configurations to accommodate different console environments. Our dual independent design provides separate temperature settings in each holder allowing the driver and passenger to individually maintain a heated or cooled beverage.

Automotive Customers Our Automotive segment customers include primarily light vehicle OEMs and Tier 1s, including automotive seat manufacturers. We also directly supply CCS products to aftermarket seat distributors and installers. The Company’s automotive marketing is directed primarily at the OEMs and their Tier 1s and focuses on the enhanced value consumers attribute to vehicles with thermal and pneumatic solutions. In many cases, the OEMs direct us to work with their suppliers, primarily their Tier 1s, to integrate our products into the vehicle’s seat or interior design. 10 Once the integration work is complete, prototypes are sent to the OEMs for evaluation and testing. If an OEM accepts our product, a program can then be launched for a particular model on a production basis, but it normally takes one to three years from the time an OEM decides to include any of our products in a vehicle model to actual production for that vehicle. During this process, we derive funding from prototype sales but obtain no significant revenue until mass production begins. Upon commencement of mass production, our products are sold by Tier 1s to the OEMs. Inherent to the automotive supplier market are costs and commitments that are incurred well in advance of the receipt of orders and resulting revenues from customers. The volume of products we sell is significantly affected by global and regional automotive production levels and the general business conditions in the automotive industry. Our product revenues are generally based upon purchase orders issued by our customers, with updated production schedules for volume adjustments. As such, we typically do not have a backlog of firm orders at any point in time. Once we are selected to supply products for a particular platform, we typically supply those products for the platform life, which is normally five to seven years, although there is no guarantee that this will occur. In addition, when we are the incumbent supplier to a given platform, we believe we have a competitive advantage in winning the redesign or replacement platform, although there is no guarantee that this will occur. For 2022, our revenues from sales to our two largest customers, Lear Corporation (“Lear”) and Adient plc (“Adient”) were $189 million and $179 million, respectively, representing 16% and 15% of our product revenues, respectively. Revenues from Lear and Adient represent sales of our climate comfort and pneumatic comfort products. Lear acquired the Interior Comfort Systems business unit of Kongsberg Automotive ASA (“Kongsberg”) in February 2022, and entered into an agreement to acquire I.G. Bauerhin (""IGB"") in May 2022, which are both key competitors of the Company’s climate comfort and pneumatic comfort products. In 2022 we believe there was an immaterial impact to our business as a result of the Kongsberg acquisition. Lear has expressed an intent to become a leading provider of thermal comfort solutions as part of a vertical integration strategy, and the magnitude of the future adverse impact on our business and financial statements remains subject to significant uncertainty. The loss of or significant reduction of business from Lear or Adient would likely have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and cash flows. However, as noted above, in many cases automotive OEMs direct their suppliers such as Lear and Adient to work with us for our climate comfort solutions, pneumatic comfort solutions, battery performance solutions and cable technology products. It is, therefore, relevant to understand how our revenues are divided among the OEMs, as shown below. Our total product revenues for each of the past three years were divided among the OEMs as follows: 2022 2021 2020 General Motors 15 % 14 % 14 % Hyundai 11 % 13 % 12 % Volkswagen 9 % 10 % 9 % Ford Motor Company 8 % 8 % 9 % Stellantis (a) 8 % 8 % 9 % BMW 7 % 6 % 6 % Daimler 7 % 5 % 6 % Honda 4 % 5 % 6 % Mazda 3 % 3 % 3 % Jaguar/Land Rover 3 % 2 % 3 % Toyota Motor Corporation 2 % 3 % 3 % Renault/Nissan 2 % 3 % 2 % Other (including Medical) 21 % 20 % 18 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % Automotive Market Trends The Gentherm automotive product portfolio aligns well with near-term and long-term consumer and technological trends: 11 Production and Suppliers Our global manufacturing and distribution facilities are located close to our key customers. In Automotive, we operate four manufacturing sites in Europe located within North Macedonia, Ukraine, Germany and Czech Republic and one distribution center located in Hungary. In North America, we operate three manufacturing sites in Mexico and one manufacturing site in the United States. In Asia, we operate three manufacturing sites in China and one in Vietnam, and one distribution center in South Korea. For Medical, we operate three manufacturing sites within China, Germany and the United States. We procure our raw materials from a variety of suppliers around the world. In the normal course of business, we do not carry substantial inventories of these raw materials in excess of levels reasonably required to meet our near-term production requirements. The automotive industry is highly reliant on semiconductors and there has been a supply shortage of semiconductors since 2021. See further discussion of the risks relating to the supply shortage of semiconductors and related risks, as well as certain mitigating activities we have undertaken, above in “—Impact of Supply Chain Disruptions and Other Matters”, in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report. Proprietary Rights and Patents The development of new or improved technologies is critical to the execution of our business strategy. Currently owned patents and patents obtained for new or improved technologies form an important basis for the success of the Company and underpin the success of our research and development efforts. We have adopted a policy of obtaining, where practical, the exclusive rights to use technology related to our products through patents or licenses for proprietary technologies or processes. We adapt and commercialize such technologies in products for mass production. We also have developed technologies or furthered the development of acquired technologies through internal research and development efforts. As of December 31, 2022, Gentherm held 531 issued patents, of which 261 were U.S. patents and 270 were non-U.S. patents. Gentherm held 265 patents directed to climate control products and thermoelectric technologies (including 5 patents directed to ClimateSense®), 74 patents directed to battery cell connecting and cable technologies, 44 patents directed to massage and lumbar technologies, 37 patents directed to air moving devices, 34 patents directed to medical technologies, 30 patents directed to heating elements and technologies, 24 patents directed to occupant sensing technologies, 18 patents directed to fluid valve technologies, and 5 patents directed to electronics technologies. The Company continued to evaluate its patents during 2022 and made strategic decisions 12 to reduce low-value patents and patents unrelated to current or planned business strategies. The acquisitions of Alfmeier and Dacheng added 68 issued patents to the Company’s patent portfolio. Competition Gentherm faces competition from other automotive suppliers and, with respect to certain products, from the OEMs and Tier 1s who manufacture or have the capability to manufacture certain products that Gentherm manufactures and supplies. The automotive supply industry competes on the basis of technology, quality, reliability of supply and price. Design, engineering capability and competitive pricing are increasingly important factors. Although the overall number of our automotive competitors has decreased due to ongoing industry consolidation, the automotive technology and components industry remains extremely competitive. The competitive landscape for patient temperature management systems includes patient thermal management medical device manufactures. We believe our expertise in core thermal management and pneumatic comfort technologies, as well as our capability in applying specific component design, global footprint and broad product offerings make us well positioned to compete against the traditional thermal management systems and pneumatic comfort suppliers, global Tier 1s and component specialists. See further discussion of the risks relating to competition in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report. Seasonality Our principal operations are directly related to the automotive industry. Consequently, we have historically experienced seasonal fluctuations to the extent automotive vehicle production slows, such as in the summer months when many customer plants close for model year changeovers and in December when many customer plants close for the holidays. Human Capital Management Employees At Gentherm, our mission is to “ create and deliver extraordinary thermal solutions that make meaningful differences in everyday life, by improving health, wellness, comfort and energy efficiency .” Our people are the foundation for making our mission come to life every day. Our human capital focus is to inspire people to achieve their aspirations and achieve strong business results. We also strive to promote a safe work environment and a culture that values fairness, diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging. Our global workforce creates a competitive advantage and operates in 14 countries in over 32 locations. As of December 31, 2022, and 2021, Gentherm’s employment levels worldwide were as follows: 2022 (a) 2021 Mexico 5,047 3,293 Macedonia 2,503 1,845 China 2,070 1,456 Ukraine 1,761 1,906 Vietnam 986 858 Germany 739 264 United States and Canada 676 488 Hungary 352 285 Czech Republic 351 — Korea 49 45 Japan 20 21 Malta 10 9 United Kingdom 4 4 Total 14,568 10,474 Notable statistics as of December 31, 2022: 13 Racially and Ethnically Diverse (Self-reported) 2022 2021 All Employees 36 % 36 % Leadership 23 % 23 % Key Highlights of our Human Capital Strategy In November 2021, we completed our first global engagement survey with a best-in-class response rate of 97%. In 2022, we developed action plans at every location to ensure we are creating a culture of feedback and continual improvement. We plan to complete another benchmark survey in 2023, including employees from our Alfmeier and Dacheng acquisitions. Health and Safety At Gentherm, our “Safety Culture” has become a core strength. Our Vision Zero strategy helped us achieve significant progress in reducing accidents across our sites. We had fewer than 20 lost time accidents in 2022. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE+I) Our DE+I mission “Embracing Diversity Inspires Innovation” cascades from our corporate mission. Our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council has built strong momentum. In 2022, we set a robust goal for talent acquisition. Such focus helped us increase diversity candidate slates, and through this effort we increased Director and VP population of Gentherm (excluding acquisitions of Alfmeier and Dacheng) representation by over 3%. We took another step forward on our DE+I journey with scaling our inclusion trainings to all global salaried-professional employees with the purpose of building local and global awareness of DE+I at Gentherm. We also held several sessions to educate our employees on unconscious bias. Our goal is ensuring all team members are educated on consistent standards, identifying feedback mechanisms to solve for conflict, and creating a culture that unites us all. Total Rewards Gentherm’s compensation and benefits programs are designed to attract and retain our employees in the locations where we compete for talent using a mix of elements that allow us to achieve our Company’s short and long-term goals. Total Talent Development At Gentherm, we provide foundational leadership development programs to ensure our current and future people leaders are well equipped to engage and lead in today’s complex business environment. We have offered additional training programs to provide 14 on-demand, flexible learning solutions for our global workforce. We continue to invest in our Accelerator program for high potential employee development to retain our future leaders. In 2022, our workforce completed over 500,000 hours of training. Environmental, Social, and Governance In 2022, we issued our third sustainability report and continued to incorporate ESG into our everyday business operations and future strategies. Our sustainability efforts are based on three pillars: People, Planet, and Places. These actions indicate the strength of our commitment to sustainability across Gentherm. Environmental and Regulatory Compliance Applicable laws and regulations, and significant changes to such laws and regulations, will potentially lead to increases in costs and complexity, and failure to comply with global and specific country regulations could subject us to civil penalties, production disruptions, or limitations on the sale of affected products. We believe we are materially in compliance with substantially all these requirements or expect to be materially in compliance by the required dates. Chemical Regulation There are numerous global laws and regulations that prohibit or restrict the selection and use of certain chemicals for product development and manufacturing and potentially impact an automobile manufacturer’s responsibility for vehicle components at the end of a vehicle’s life. New chemical regulations continue to be introduced and passed, such as the new European requirements that require suppliers of parts and vehicles to the European market to disclose certain substances of concern in parts. Further, increases in the use of circuit boards and other electronics may require additional assessment under the directives related to certain hazardous substances and waste from electrical and electronic equipment. Vehicle Safety In the U.S., the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (the “Safety Act”) regulates motor vehicle equipment that we manufacture and sell as well as vehicles. The Safety Act prohibits the sale in the United States of any new vehicle or equipment that does not conform to applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards established by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”). The Safety Act further requires that if a vehicle manufacturer or NHTSA determine a vehicle or an item of vehicle equipment does not comply with a safety standard, or that vehicle or equipment contains a defect that poses an unreasonable safety risk, the vehicle manufacturer must conduct a safety recall to remedy that condition in the affected vehicles. Should a vehicle manufacturer or NHTSA determine a safety defect or noncompliance issue exists with respect to any of our products, the cost of such recall campaigns could be substantial. Further, many other countries have established vehicle and vehicle equipment safety standards and regulations. Meeting or exceeding the many safety standards is costly as global compliance and non-governmental assessment requirements continue to evolve and grow more complex, and lack harmonization globally. 15 I TEM 1A. RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider each of the risks, assumptions, uncertainties and other factors described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, as well as any amendments or updates reflected in subsequent filings or furnishings with the SEC. We believe these risks, assumptions, uncertainties and other factors, individually or in the aggregate, could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results and could materially and adversely affect our business operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Industry and Operational Risks The automotive industry, our primary market, is cyclical and is significantly impacted by macroeconomic, geopolitical and similar global factors, and a decline in the production levels of our major customers and OEMs, particularly with respect to models for which we supply significant amounts of product, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our Automotive segment represents 96%, 96% and 95% of our product revenues for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Demand for our automotive products is directly related to automotive vehicle production, which is ultimately dependent on consumer demand for automotive vehicles, our content per vehicle, and other factors that may limit or otherwise impact production by us, our supply chain and our customers. Automotive sales and production are cyclical and are materially affected by macroeconomic, geopolitical and industry conditions that are outside of our control and the control of our customers and suppliers, including monetary fiscal policy, economic recessions, inflation, political instability, labor relations issues, energy prices, regulatory requirements, government initiatives, trade restrictions and agreements, capital and liquidity constraints, acts or war and terrorism, and natural and man-made disasters. Our operational costs are similarly impacted by such macroeconomic, geopolitical and industry conditions, which has and may continue to adversely impact our margins and profitability. In recent years, macroeconomic, geopolitical and industry conditions were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and related government actions and restrictions, as well as health and safety measures implemented by companies and persons; any future impacts from such pandemic are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic materially adversely affects the Company's business and financial results, it may also have the effect of significantly heightening many of the other risks associated with the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and stock price, including in ways that we cannot predict. If we fail to manage our growth effectively or to integrate successfully any new or future business ventures, acquisitions, investments or strategic alliance into our business, including our recent acquisitions, our business and financial performance could be materially adversely harmed. We regularly consider opportunities to pursue business ventures, acquisitions, investments and strategic alliances that could leverage our products, technologies and capabilities, as well as, enhance our customer base, geographic penetration and scale, to complement our current businesses, some of which could be material. We completed two acquisitions in 2022, Alfmeier and Dacheng, and we have completed other acquisitions and investments in recent years. Finding and assessing a potential growth opportunity and completing a transaction involves extensive due diligence, management time and expense; however, the amount of information we can obtain about a potential growth opportunity may be limited, and we may not be able to identify suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate terms, obtain financing on acceptable terms, complete proposed acquisitions, or expand into new geographies or markets. Further, we can give no assurance that new business ventures, acquisitions, investments and strategic alliances will positively affect our financial performance or will perform as planned, including regarding anticipated synergies or other financial or operational benefits. For significant transactions, we would expect to incur additional debt, issue equity and/or increase capital expenditures, which may increase leverage risks, result in dilution or reduce capital available for other investments in ongoing operations. If we fail to identify and complete suitable acquisition and investment opportunities in a timely and successful manner, our business, growth strategy reputation and results of operations could be materially impacted. Furthermore, the success of our acquisitions is dependent, in part, on our ability to realize the expected benefits from the integration of the acquired businesses or assets. We may incur an unexpected amount of liabilities or make incorrect estimates regarding the planned accounting for acquisitions, such as the need to record non-recurring charges or write-off of significant amounts of goodwill or other assets that could adversely affect our results of operations, and we could have unexpected challenges due to the limitations of our due diligence process or contractual provisions. Further, the integration of acquired businesses is a complex, costly and time-consuming process that requires significant management attention and resources. It is possible that the integration process 16 could result in the loss of key employees, the disruption of our operations, the inability to maintain or increase its competitive presence, inconsistencies in and incompatibility of information technology and accounting systems, as well as other compliance standards, controls, procedures and policies, difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from the acquisition, additional litigation, compliance or regulatory risk, the diversion of management’s attention to integration matters and difficulties in the assimilation of employees and corporate cultures, especially if the acquisition involves a business, supply chain or operations in one or more countries in which we have a limited history and lack of experience. Any or all of these factors and our increased debt leverage following the closing of any significant transaction, such as the acquisition of Alfmeier, could have an adverse effect on our business and financial performance. In addition, many of these factors are outside of our control, and any one of these factors could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and additional diversion of management’s time and energy, which could materially adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. Likewise, our failure to integrate and manage acquired companies successfully may lead to reduced profitability and future impairment of any associated goodwill and intangible asset balances. Our inability to effectively manage the development, timing, quality and costs of new product launches could adversely affect our financial performance. Gentherm develops and launches new products and related technologies through internal research and development, and from acquisitions and investments in joint ventures. Further, winning new business awards will include specific customer requirements regarding, among other things, timing, performance and quality standards. The launch of new products and technologies is complex, the success of which depends on a wide range of factors, including the robustness of our product and manufacturing process development, success in sourcing new components and commodities with suitable suppliers, readiness of our and our suppliers' manufacturing facilities and manufacturing processes, as well as factors related to tooling, equipment, employees, initial product quality and other factors. New launches have become even more complicated given the increased use of advanced electronics that must be integrated throughout a vehicle. Given the complexity of new product and technology launches, we may experience difficulties managing product quality, timeliness and associated costs. In addition, new program launches require a significant ramp up of costs up to a few years prior to sales of such products. However, our sales related to these new programs generally are dependent upon the timing and success of our customers’ introduction of new vehicles. Our inability to effectively manage the timing, quality and costs of these new program launches could have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. To the extent we are not able to successfully launch new business, vehicle production at our customers could be significantly delayed or shut down. Such operating failures could result in significant financial penalties to us or a diversion of personnel and financial resources to improving launches rather than investment in continuous process improvement or other growth initiatives, and could result in our customers shifting work away from us to a competitor. Any of the foregoing matters could result in a significant loss of revenue and market share and could have an adverse effect on our profitability and cash flows. We operate in a highly competitive industry and efforts by our competitors, as well as new non-traditional entrants to the industry could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The automotive component supply industry is subject to intense competition. Business is typically awarded to the supplier offering the most favorable combination of cost, quality, timely delivery, technological innovation and service. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully with the products of our competitors. Further, our competitors’ efforts to grow market share could exert downward pressure on our product pricing and margins. Many of our competitors are substantially larger in size and have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do, and therefore may be more effective in adapting to customer requirements while being more profitable. In addition, our customers may increase levels of production insourcing and compete directly with us for a variety of reasons, such as shifts in business strategies or the emergence of low-cost production opportunities in other countries, which may adversely affect our sales as well as the profit margins on our products. The global automotive supply chain has been adversely impacted by raw material and component shortages, manufacturing disruptions and delays, logistics challenges and inflationary and other cost pressures, and we expect such conditions to continue to adversely affect our business, profitability and results of operations. Our products contain a significant number of components that we source globally from suppliers who, in turn, source components from their global suppliers. If our supply chain fails to deliver products to us in sufficient quality and quantity on a timely 17 basis, we will be challenged to meet our production schedules and fulfill our orders due to the “just-in-time” manufacturing process that is broadly utilized in our industry, which would decrease sales and profits and could damage our commercial reputation and customer relationships. Similarly, OEMs and Tier 1s to whom we supply our products are dependent on an ever-greater number of global suppliers to manufacture and sell their products to consumers, which drives sales of our products. We and our customers, and our respective supply chains, have operated in a supply-constrained environment for over one year and are continuing to manage through raw material and component shortages, manufacturing disruptions and delays, logistics challenges and inflationary and other operational challenges and costs pressures, each of which is described in the risk factors below and has adversely affected, and is expected to continue to adversely effect, our business, profitability and results of operations. We have taken certain mitigation efforts to address such matters, which has led to increased operating costs and carrying costs due to the build-up of inventory. Raw material and component shortages and pricing impacts have adversely impacted our business and financial performance and we expect these conditions to continue. The availability of raw materials and product components fluctuates due to factors outside of our control, including supply and demand imbalances, geopolitical and macroeconomic factors, trade laws and tariffs, natural disasters, and global pandemics such as COVID-19, which has and we expect will continue to impact the ability of our supply chain to meet our production requirements and therefore our ability to meet the production demands of our customers. Even a single small subcomponent necessary to manufacture our product could force us to cease production, potentially for a prolonged period. In particular, since 2021, the automotive industry is continuing to navigate through a significant shortage of semiconductors, a critical component in the automotive industry. We, the OEMs and Tier 1s must compete among the automotive supply chain and with other industries to satisfy current and near-term requirements for semiconductors, and such allocation is not within our control even though we have continued to attempt various mitigating actions. Certain semiconductors we utilize are sourced from a very limited number of suppliers and many suppliers are based in Taiwan (and therefore such supply may be impacted by China-Taiwan geopolitical matters), which further exacerbates the risks to our operations. The shortage of semiconductors and other key components (historically, such as TEDs), has disrupted our production schedule and has caused us to procure components on the open market, from time to time, at prices significantly above the contractual pricing we have with our current long-term suppliers. OEM and Tier 1 production also has been impacted by the shortage, which has resulted in reduced sales of our products. While the global semiconductor supply shortage is easing, it has had, and is continuing to have, wide-ranging effects. Furthermore, sudden changes in the production schedules of OEMs and Tier 1s caused by raw material and component shortages also have resulted and may continue to result in operating inefficiencies, which could adversely affect our profitability and results of operations. If we were to fail to make timely deliveries in accordance with contractual obligations, we generally must absorb our own costs for identifying and solving the problem as well as expeditiously producing replacement components or products. Generally, we must also carry the costs associated with catching up, such as overtime and premium freight. Additionally, if we are the primary cause for a customer being forced to halt production, the customer may seek to recoup all of its losses and expenses from the Company. The raw material and component shortages have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, profitability and results of operations. We also have experienced and we may continue to experience margin pressure due to the pricing of components and certain other raw materials. Some of our products contain certain components, such as semiconductor chips, tellurium, a raw material used in TEDs, and other key raw materials including copper, silver and petroleum-based engineered plastics and raw materials, which generally cannot be substituted. The prices for these components and raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions. The automotive industry has seen a period of sustained price increases for commodities, primarily related to steel, and to a lesser extent petrochemicals. If the market prices and related logistics costs (in particular for imported goods) for these components and raw materials remain higher than normal or they further increase, our gross profit may continue to be adversely impacted, including to the extent our suppliers pass cost increases on to us that we cannot pass on in full to our customers in spite of our mitigation efforts. Inflationary pressures impacting our suppliers, customers, transportation companies and other third parties have increased our costs to manufacture and deliver our products, and therefore adversely impacted our margins and profitability. The automotive industry has experienced a period of sustained price increases for various material components and transportation and other logistics services. These price increases are expected to continue into the foreseeable future due to continuing challenges with supply-demand imbalances. Although the Company has developed and implemented strategies to mitigate the impact 18 of higher material component costs and transportation and other logistics costs, these strategies, together with commercial negotiations with Gentherm's customers and suppliers, have not historically and may not in the future fully offset our price increases, which may result in adverse impacts to the Company’s profitability and results of operations. A highly inflationary environment also can have a negative impact on customers’ willingness to purchase our products. We generally have been unable to raise prices to address in full the foregoing inflationary pricing pressures, together with price downs for our products that are customary in our industry, and therefore our margins and profitability have been and may continue to be adversely impacted. The supply-constrained environment has led to a significant increase in inventory, which has had an adverse impact on profitability and could lead to future impairment. In order to secure components for our products, we have and may continue to strategically purchase components in advance of demand to take advantage of favorable pricing or to address concerns about future availability. If we fail to anticipate customer demand properly, a temporary oversupply could result in excess or obsolete components, which could adversely affect our business and financial performance, including due to impairment of such assets. Our global operations subject us to risks that may harm our operations and financial results. In 2022, 61% of our product revenue was generated from sales to customers outside the United States. We have significant personnel, property, equipment and operations in a number of countries outside of the United States, including China, Germany, Hungary, North Macedonia, Mexico, South Korea, Czech Republic, Ukraine and Vietnam. Our exposure to the risks described below is substantial. We also derive a significant portion of revenues from Europe and Asia and conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies. In addition to the general risks relating to our operations, our international operations are subject to unique risks inherent in doing business abroad, including: 19 Additionally, our primary manufacturing locations are in Mexico, China, Vietnam, North Macedonia, Czech Republic and Ukraine, all countries that have historically experienced a heightened degree of political, civil and labor uncertainty. In China, continued U.S.-China trade tensions and weakening economic conditions, among other factors, may result in reduced sales, profitability and margins, increased operating costs and challenges to gaining or holding market share. Furthermore, certain risks and uncertainties of doing business in China are solely within the control of the Chinese government, including Chinese regulation of the scope of our business and investments in China, as well as our ability to provide cash to and repatriate cash from our business entities in China. In order to maintain access to the Chinese market, we may be required to comply with significant technical and other regulatory requirements that are unique to the Chinese market, at times with challenging lead times. These actions may increase the cost of doing business in China or limit how and under what conditions we may do business in China, which could materially and adversely affect our profitability and financial condition. Our operations within Ukraine subject us to risks that may harm our operations and financial results. The United States and global markets are experiencing volatility and disruption due to the escalation of geopolitical tensions and the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. The conflict and certain measures taken in response have impacted the availability and prices of certain raw materials and energy (especially in Europe), and could have a lasting impact on regional and global economies. For example in response to Russia’s invasion in Ukraine, a number of countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom and members of the European Union, have implemented economic sanctions on Russia, Belarus and nearby regions, as well as numerous Russian individuals and enterprises including several large banks and state-owned entities. Our facility in Vynohradiv is on the far western corner within the Transcarpathia region of Ukraine near the Hungary border. In 2022, products manufactured at our Ukraine facility represented approximately 8% of the Company’s total revenue, including automotive cables, seat heaters and steering wheel heaters, compared to 11% in 2021. At this time, our Ukraine facility is operating at normal levels and we continue to execute contingency plans and, in coordination with certain customers, specific equipment and production relocations leveraging our flexible global manufacturing footprint. Certain of our employees in Ukraine are routinely conscripted into the military and/or sent to the Russian border to fight in the ongoing conflict. We have incurred, and will likely continue to incur costs to support our employees and relocate equipment and production based on customer and company needs. We have also experienced and may continue to experience interruptions in power supply at our Ukraine facility. We have contingency measures in place to address intermittent power supply interruptions, however, extended interruptions could significantly impact our ability to operate the facility. Further, most of our products manufactured in Ukraine are shipped across the border from Ukraine to Hungary for further delivery to our customers. If that border crossing were to be closed or restricted for any reason, we may experience a significant disruption to our operations. Our response to the ongoing conflict is based on a severity level contingency response plan that has been developed with certain customers. As the situation in Ukraine is very fluid, we continue to monitor its effects on our business and we continue to work closely with our customers to adjust our contingency response as necessary. Although the length and impact of the ongoing military conflict is highly unpredictable, the conflict in Ukraine has led to and could lead to further market disruptions, including significant volatility in the prices and availability of certain commodities and energy, volatility in credit and capital markets, interruptions in our supply chain, increased costs and reduced availability of labor, materials and components, result in impairment of tangible assets and implementation of restructuring activities, and may impair our ability to complete financial or banking transactions. Any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial results and stock price. Labor shortages, work stoppages and additional workforce disruptions impacting us, our suppliers or customers periodically have disrupted our operations and our growth strategies, and resulting increases in labor and related operating costs may adversely impact our financial performance. Labor shortages, work stoppages and additional workforce disruptions due to illness, quarantines and absenteeism, including ours and those at our suppliers or customers, periodically have disrupted our business and adversely impacted our financial performance. Because the automotive industry relies heavily on “just-in-time” delivery of components, labor shortages or work stoppages at one or more of Gentherm's production facilities or those of our suppliers could have adverse effects on the business and financial results, including if the OEMs elect to manufacture and sell cars without our products if we are unable to deliver our products on a timely basis or at all. Similarly, if one or more of our direct customers or an OEM were to experience labor shortages or work stoppages, such as what occurred during the General Motors labor strike occurring in the Fall of 2019 or the prolonged work stoppages that occurred in the first half of 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, they likely would halt or limit purchases of our products, which could result in the temporary shutdown of the related Gentherm production facilities or other restructuring initiatives. 20 Approximately 31% of the Company's workforce are members of industrial trade unions and we believe a significant percentage of employees of our largest customers and suppliers are members of industrial trade unions, all of whom are employed under the terms of various labor agreements. A union strike or inability to enter into a new labor agreement prior to expiration of an existing agreement could have an adverse impact on us or our suppliers or customers. In addition, competition for skilled workers due to labor shortages has increased labor costs and created employee retention and recruitment challenges, which has adversely impacted our profitability and operations and ability to execute on certain strategic initiatives. Our inability to achieve product cost reductions which offset customer-imposed price reductions could adversely affect our financial performance. Downward pricing pressure is customarily applied by automotive manufacturers to the automotive supply chain. Our customer contracts generally provide for annual price reductions over the production life of the vehicle, while requiring us to assume significant responsibility for the design, development and engineering of our products, as well as the costs incurred through our supply chain. Prices may also be adjusted on an ongoing basis to reflect changes in product content/costs and other commercial factors. Our inability to achieve product cost reductions that offset customer-imposed price reductions could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology networks and systems, including a disruption related to cybersecurity, could interfere with our operations and could compromise the confidentiality of our proprietary information or personal information. We rely on our information technology systems and networks in connection with many of our business activities. Some of these networks and systems are managed by third-party service providers and are not under our direct control. Our operations routinely involve receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business, customers, suppliers, employees and other sensitive matters. We rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our IT and data security infrastructure, as well as our ability to expand and continually update this infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business. If we experience a problem with the functioning of an important IT system or a security breach of our IT systems, due to failure to timely upgrade systems or during system upgrades and/or new system implementations, or resulting from failures of our third-party service providers, the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business. As with most companies, we have experienced cyber-attacks, attempts to breach our systems and other similar incidents, none of which were material in 2022. Any future cyber incidents could, however, materially disrupt operational systems; result in loss of trade secrets or other proprietary or competitively sensitive information; compromise personally identifiable information regarding customers or employees; delay our ability to deliver products to customers; and jeopardize the security of our facilities. A cyber incident could be caused by malicious outsiders (including state-sponsored espionage or cyberwarfare) or insiders using sophisticated methods to circumvent firewalls, encryption and other security defenses. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Information technology security threats, including security breaches, computer malware, “ransomware” and other cyber-attacks, are increasing in both frequency and sophistication. Many victims of ransomware are forced to pay significant ransoms to regain access to their critical business data, and we may not be permitted under various regulations and laws to make such payments. With more of our employees working part-time remotely and in periods of significant acquisition integration activity such as we are currently undertaking, there may be increased opportunities for unauthorized access and cyber-attacks. Further, the United States government has warned of the potential risk of Russian cyberattacks stemming from the ongoing Russian-Ukraine conflict. We continuously seek to maintain a robust program of information security and controls, but the impact of a material information technology event could subject us to legal or regulatory sanctions and have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Despite our implementation of security measures, our IT systems, like those of other companies, are vulnerable to damages from computer viruses, natural disasters (which may become more frequent due to climate change), unauthorized access, cyber-attack and other similar disruptions. Any system failure, accident or security breach could result in disruptions to our operations and include the theft of our intellectual property, trade secrets, customer information, human resources information or other confidential information. The foregoing matters could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with its customers, lead to claims against us, fines and other penalties assessed upon us by governmental authorities, and ultimately harm our business and financial performance. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to remediate and protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future. 21 There is ongoing significant competition to address the evolution of the automotive industry towards electric vehicles, autonomous vehicles and mobility on demand services, and our failure to adapt our strategies and operations successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The global automotive industry is experiencing a period of significant technological change, and we are making significant investments to develop and acquire technologies and products that will enhance our competitiveness. Future automotive vehicle production is expected to be affected significantly by additional industry or consumer behaviors, including the development and use of autonomous and electric vehicles and increasing use of car and ridesharing and on-demand transportation as a service, as well as related regulations. Our future success is dependent on our ability to execute our long-term strategies addressing the evolution of the automotive industry and customer utilization of personal transportation. The rapidly evolving nature of the markets in which we compete has attracted, and may continue to attract, new entrants, including new entrants from outside the traditional automotive supply industry. Further, in comparison to us, our competitors may foresee the course of market developments more accurately, develop superior products and technologies, produce similar products at a lower cost, or adapt quicker to new industry technologies. If we do not accurately predict, prepare for and respond to new kinds of technological innovations, market developments and changing customer needs, our long-term competitiveness could be harmed significantly and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely impacted. Our ability to market our products successfully depends on acceptance of our products by existing and potential customers and consumers, as well as the success of our customers. We have been, and will continue to be, required to educate potential customers and demonstrate that the merits of our existing products justify the costs associated with them. Similar and enhanced efforts will be required with existing and potential customers for additional products and technologies we develop, acquire or license. Customers will only include our products if there appears to be consumer demand. For our automotive products, we rely on OEMs and applicable dealer networks to market our products to consumers, and we do not have any control over the marketing budget or messaging nor the training of employees and agents regarding our products. Further, OEMs and dealer networks may market products offered by our competitors, including products manufactured by such OEMs. If customers or consumers conclude that our automotive products are unnecessary or too expensive or that our competitors offer more favorable sales terms or better products, OEMs and other customers may reduce availability or decline to include our products in their vehicles. Our ongoing efforts to optimize our global supply chain could cause supply disruptions and be more costly, time-consuming and resource-intensive than expected. Our ongoing efforts to optimize the efficiency of our global supply chain could cause supply disruptions and could be more expensive, time-consuming and resource-intensive than expected. Furthermore, certain of our suppliers may decide to discontinue business with us or limit the allocation of products to us or we may become too dependent on one or more suppliers, which could result in our inability to fill our supply needs and jeopardize our ability to fulfill our contractual obligations, which could in turn, result in a decrease in revenues and profitability, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships. We manage our business based on projected future sales volume, which is highly dependent on information received from customers and general market data, and any inaccuracies or changes in such information could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We manage our business based upon projected future sales volumes, which are based upon many factors, including awarded business and assumptions of conversion rates thereof, customers’ forecasts and general macroeconomic and industry market data. Our product revenues generally are based upon purchase orders issued by our customers, with updated production schedules for volume adjustments, and our customers generally do not guarantee sales volumes. As such, we typically do not have a backlog of firm orders at any point in time. In addition, awarded business may include business under arrangements that our customers have the right to terminate without penalty at any time. Further, our customers’ forecasts are subject to numerous assumptions, and such forecasts often are changed rapidly with limited notice. Therefore, our actual sales volumes, and thus the ultimate amount of revenue that we derive from such sales, are not committed. We also must incur costs and make commitments well in advance of the receipt of orders and resulting revenues from customers. If actual production orders from our customers are not consistent with our projected future sales volumes, especially for our higher-margin products, we could realize substantially less revenue and incur greater expenses over the life of vehicle programs. 22 The receipt of orders and resulting revenues from customers is significantly affected by global automotive production levels. Recent macroeconomic, geopolitical and industry factors noted above have made it particularly challenging for us to project future sales volumes and manage our business. The material reduction in sales from any of our principal customers, due to acquisition activity, insolvency or otherwise, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. For the year ended December 31, 2022, our top two customers were Lear and Adient, which comprised 16% and 15%, respectively, of our product revenues. Combined, approximately 70% of product revenues to these customers was sourced directly by the OEMs. Our products supplied to General Motors and Hyundai represented 15% and 11% of our total product revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022. The continued growth, viability and financial stability of our principal customers, as well as the OEMs to which our products are supplied, are critical to our success. The loss of any significant portion of our sales from either of these customers or other significant customers, whether due to acquisition activity, insolvency or otherwise, would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We sometimes experience, and we expect to continue to experience, a delay in our collection of accounts receivable balances from our customers, which may be significant and could be at risk in the event of their bankruptcy or other restructuring. In addition, if any of our significant customers successfully insources products that we currently manufacture, whether by the acquisition of one of our competitors or otherwise, the discontinuation or loss of business as a result would have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance. For example, Lear recently has acquired certain companies that have competed with us historically and has announced its intent to insource more products and technologies in the future, and Lear may compete with us directly in the future. The impact of Lear’s acquisitions on our business with Lear, as well as with OEMs and other Tier 1s, is unknown and could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our business is subject to risks associated with manufacturing processes. If certain of our existing production facilities become incapable of manufacturing products or production capacity is limited for any reason, such as terror attacks, war, or other civil disturbances, natural disasters (which may be more frequent due to climate change), other catastrophic events, public health crises, labor shortages, work stoppages, or other events that cause facility closures or production disruptions, we may be unable to meet production requirements, sales and profits could decline, and our commercial reputation could be damaged. For example, we experienced extended work stoppages in the first half of 2020 as the pandemic spread and governmental authorities initiated “lock-down” orders for all non-essential activities. Without operation of certain existing production facilities, we may be limited in our ability to deliver products until we restore the manufacturing capability at the particular facility, find an alternative manufacturing facility or arrange an alternative source of supply. We maintain property damage insurance that we believe to be adequate to provide for reconstruction of facilities and equipment, as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from any production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss. However, any recovery under our insurance policies may not offset the lost sales, harm to our business reputation or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations. Further, any such proceeds may be received and accounted for in a different reporting period, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow generally or for a specific reporting period. We use important intellectual property in our business. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if a third party makes assertions against us or our customers relating to intellectual property rights, our business could be adversely affected . We own important intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets. Our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in many of the markets that we serve. We cannot guarantee, however, that we will be able to secure all desired protection, nor that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate, to prevent infringement of our rights or misappropriation or theft of our technology, trade secrets or know-how. For example, effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some of the countries in which we operate. In addition, while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our trade secrets, know-how, business strategy and other proprietary information, such confidentiality agreements could be breached or otherwise may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and know-how related to the design, manufacture or operation of our products. If it became necessary for us to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights, any proceedings could be burdensome and costly, and we may not prevail. Further, adequate remedies may not be available in 23 the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise. Finally, for those products in our portfolio that rely on patent protection, once a patent has expired, the product is generally open to competition. Products under patent protection usually generate higher revenues and profitability than those not protected by patents. If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could suffer, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, our competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies or design around the patents we own or license. Further, as we expand our operations in jurisdictions where the protection of intellectual property rights is less robust, the risk of others duplicating our proprietary technologies increases, despite efforts we undertake to protect them. Foreign governments may adopt regulations, and foreign governments or courts may render decisions, requiring compulsory licensing of intellectual property rights, or foreign governments may require products to meet standards that serve to favor local companies or provide reduced protection relative to other countries. Our Board approved the Company’s plan to exit its non-automotive electronics business, including a potential sale or wind-down of the business, and will incur significant non-cash expenses. In December 2022, our Board approve the Company’s plan to exit its non-automotive electronics business to strengthen the Company’s core business and focus its resources and equipment with businesses and investments that are more strategic and profitable. The Company will continue to sell certain business products until the exit is complete. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the Company’s product revenues from the business were $17.1 million. In connection with approval of the plan to exit the non-automotive electronics business, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $9.4 million, $5.6 million and $0.7 million for write-downs of inventory, intangible assets, and property and equipment, respectively. The Company is expected to incur total non-cash expenses of between $13 million and $18 million. The Company may be unable sell the business or substantially all of its assets on a timely basis, for a reasonable purchase price or at all, any wind-down of the business may not occur on a timely basis or require more of the Company’s resources than anticipated, the Company’s incurred expense related to the exit from or wind-down of the business may exceed the Company’s projections and there may be additional expense and costs in future periods. Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks Economic and trade policy, including tariffs and customs regulations, could have a material and adverse effect on our business. The U.S. has established free trade laws and regulations that set certain duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports, subject to compliance with the applicable classification and other requirements. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products, such as China and Mexico, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. In recent years, the U.S. and Chinese governments have imposed a series of significant incremental retaliatory tariffs to certain imported products. Most notably with respect to the automotive industry, the U.S. imposed tariffs on imports of certain steel, aluminum and automotive components, and China imposed retaliatory tariffs on imports of U.S. vehicles and certain automotive components. Depending upon their duration and implementation, as well as our ability to mitigate their impact, these tariffs and any other future regulatory actions implemented on a broader range of products or raw materials could materially affect our business, including in the form of increased cost of goods sold, decreased margins, increased pricing for customers, reduced sales and disruption in our supply chain. In addition, various countries regulate cross-border transactions of certain products through import permitting and licensing requirements. The exportation, re-exportation, transfers within foreign countries and importation of our products, including by our suppliers and vendors, must comply with these laws and regulations, and any violations may result in reputational harm, government investigations and penalties, and a denial or curtailment of importing or exporting activities. Complying with export control and sanctions laws may be time consuming, may increase our costs, and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. If we are found to be in violation of U.S. sanctions or export control laws, or similar laws in other jurisdictions, we and the individuals working for us could incur substantial fines and penalties. Changes in export, sanctions or import laws or regulations may delay the introduction and sale of our products in the U.S. and international markets, require us to spend resources to seek necessary government authorizations or to develop different versions of our products, or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our products to certain countries, regions, governments, persons or entities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. 24 We may face particular privacy, data security and data protection risks. We are subject to several data privacy and data security laws and regulations in the various jurisdictions that we operate. An increasing number of U.S. states have enacted data privacy and security laws and regulations that govern the collection, use, disclosure, transfer, storage, disposal, and protection of personal information, such as social security numbers, financial information and other information. For example, several U.S. territories and all 50 states have adopted data breach rules that require timely notification if a company has experienced the unauthorized access or acquisition of personal information. Similarly, many of the requirements mandated by the California Consumer Protection Act (“CCPA”) that went into effect on January 1, 2020 have not yet been interpreted by courts, and best practices are still being developed by the industry, all of which increase the risk of compliance failure and related adverse impacts. Furthermore, on January 1, 2023, substantive provisions of the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) became effective, in some cases requiring new or modified practices and operations. Other states enacted similar privacy laws in recent years and other states are considering doing so. These privacy laws may impose substantial penalties for violations, impose significant costs for investigations and compliance, allow private class-action litigation and carry significant potential liability for our business. Legislators and/or regulators in foreign countries in which we operate are increasingly adopting or revising privacy, information security and data protection laws as well. In particular, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective on May 25, 2018, imposes additional obligations and risk upon our business and which increases substantially the penalties to which we could be subject in the event of any non-compliance. Many countries have enacted similar types of legislative and regulatory requirements concerning data protection, and additional countries are considering similar legal frameworks. The CCPA, CPRA, GDPR and other similar laws and regulations including those recently or soon to be enacted (such as the SECs proposed cybersecurity disclosure regulations), as well as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions, may be costly to comply with, result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention to monitor and be in compliance with, and subject us to remedies that may harm our business, including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices. Defects or quality issues associated with our automotive and medical products, as well as a significant product liability lawsuit, warranty claim or product recall involving us or one of our major customers, or an investigation regarding vehicle safety generally, could adversely affect the results of our operations. Our design, manufacture and marketing of automotive products may subject us to warranty claims and product liability in the event that our products (or the products of our customers that incorporate our products) fail to perform as expected and, in the case of product liability, such failure of our products (or the products of our customers that incorporate our products) results or is alleged to result in bodily injury or property damage. This risk may be enhanced for any new developed products or recently acquired products, which has been a significant part of our growth in recent years. If any of our products are or are alleged to be defective, we also may be required by our customers or regulators to participate in a recall or other corrective action involving such products, which we have been subject to periodically. Automotive manufacturers are increasingly looking to their suppliers for contribution when faced with recalls and product liability claims, as well as requiring their suppliers to guarantee or warrant their products and bear the costs of repair and replacement of such products under new vehicle warranties. OEMs historically have recalled vehicles for perceived defects in seat heaters, and we have incurred liabilities in connection with the recalls and other field actions. In addition, governmental regulatory agencies throughout the world, such as NHTSA in the U.S., have safety standards that require manufacturers to remedy defects related to vehicle safety through safety recall campaigns, and a manufacturer is obligated to recall vehicles if it determines that the vehicles do not comply with a safety standard. Any large liability claims, if made, could exceed our insurance coverage limits and insurance may not continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, and we may incur significant costs to defend these claims. In addition, we may not be successful in recovering amounts from third parties, including suppliers, in connection with these claims. In certain instances, allegedly defective products may be the result of components supplied by our supply chain, and we may be limited in our ability to obtain recovery from our suppliers of materials or services included within our products that are associated with product liability and warranty claims, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. A recall, product liability or warranty claim brought against us that is not insured or is in excess of our available insurance, and if other third parties do not contribute or indemnify us, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and reputation or market acceptance of our products. 25 The design, manufacture and marketing of medical products involve certain inherent risks. Manufacturing or design defects, component failures, unapproved or improper use of our products, or inadequate disclosure of risks or other information relating to the use of our products can lead to regulatory action, injury or other serious adverse events. These events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products (either voluntary or as required by the FDA or similar governmental authorities in other countries), and could result, in certain cases, in the removal of a product from the market. A recall, inadequate disclosure or defect could result in significant costs and lost sales and customers, enforcement actions and/or investigations by state and federal governments or other enforcement bodies, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce future demand for our products. Personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in significant product liability claims being brought against us. In some circumstances, such adverse events could also cause delays in regulatory approval of new products or the imposition of post-market approval requirements, such as further clinical testing. Such clinical testing is costly and time-consuming and could delay market approval or the meeting of additional post-market requirements. Our business may be negatively impacted by the effects of climate change and by regulatory and stakeholder-imposed requirements to address climate change and other sustainability issues. As evidenced by shifting industry and consumer behaviors, including the development and use of electric vehicles, the automotive industry and consumers have a heightened focus on climate change and the environmental impact of product manufacturing and end use. This increased focus on sustainability and the environmental impact of the automotive industry and manufacturing processes has caused our customers and other stakeholders to impose additional requirements on us and our suppliers, which often exceed regulatory standards. These customer requirements include increased tracking and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental metrics, reduced waste and wastewater from operations, increased use of sustainable materials in our products, and the use of renewable energy sources in our factory operations. We expect to incur increased operating costs and capital expenditures to procure renewable energy and additional equipment or make operational and process changes to comply with customer requirements. To the extent we are unable to meet or exceed customer sustainability requirements, demand for our products and our revenues could be adversely impacted. A failure to adequately meet other stakeholder expectations may result in the loss of business, diluted market valuation, an inability to attract customers or an inability to attract and retain top talent. Climate change is continuing to receive ever increasing attention worldwide. Many scientists, legislators and others attribute climate change to increased levels of greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, which has led to and we expect will continue to lead to legislative and regulatory efforts in many jurisdictions to limit greenhouse gas emissions. New federal or state restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide that may be imposed on vehicles and automobile fuels could adversely affect demand for vehicles, annual miles driven or the products we sell, lead to changes in automotive technology, and expedite the transition to electric vehicles. Compliance with any new or more stringent laws or regulations, or stricter interpretations of existing laws, could require increased capital expenditures to improve our product portfolio to meet such new laws, regulations and standards. Such legislative developments could adversely impact our business by increasing costs and could require us to make changes to our operations and result in substantial additional capital expenditures and operating costs. These additional costs, changes in operations, or loss of revenues could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Finally, the effects of climate change, such as increased intensity, frequency or duration of storms, droughts or other severe weather events may create financial or physical risk to us. Physical risks include disrupting the manufacturing, logistics and procurement activities and employee working conditions of us, our supply chain and our customers. Financial risks include the fluctuating demand for our products and technologies based on the climate where consumers live, since our business involves thermal management technologies, as well as potential additional costs of insurance and maintaining facilities in certain regions prone to climate risk. We could also face indirect financial risks passed through the supply chain, and process disruptions due to physical climate changes could result in price modifications for our products and the resources needed to produce them. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Our patient temperature management business is subject to extensive industry regulation and failure to comply with all applicable rules and regulation may adversely impact us. Our patient temperature management products are subject to extensive, complex, costly and evolving government regulation. In the United States, this is principally administered by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). Various regulatory agencies in foreign countries where our medical products are sold also regulate that business. Under both United States and foreign country regulations, we are subject to periodic inspection of our facilities (including third-party facilities that are performing services for us), procedures and operations and testing of our products. Following such FDA inspections, should any noncompliance with regulations 26 or other quality issues be noted, we may receive observations, notices, citations and/or warning letters that could require us to get FDA approval of a corrective action plan and modify certain activities identified during the inspection, possibly at a significant cost. We are also required to report adverse events associated with our medical products to the FDA and other foreign regulatory authorities where our products have been approved or received market clearance. Unexpected or serious health or safety concerns could result in liability claims, recalls, market withdrawals or other regulatory actions. Changes in laws or regulations could require us to change the way we operate or to utilize resources to maintain compliance, which could increase costs or otherwise disrupt operations. In addition, failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations could result in fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses or, in rare circumstances, market withdrawal of the product. The process for obtaining governmental approval to manufacture and market new medical devices is time-consuming and costly. We are dependent on receiving FDA and other governmental or third-party approvals prior to manufacturing, marketing and shipping any new medical products. We cannot be certain that any new medical products we develop will receive FDA or other necessary approvals. Also receipt of approval in one country does not guarantee approval by the FDA or any other foreign regulatory agency. Any failure to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations could have a material and adverse effect on our reputation, business and financial results. Our operations outside of the United States require us to comply with various anti-bribery and anti-corruption regulations, including but not limited to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act and the China Anti-Unfair Competition Law. Violations of these laws, which are complex and often difficult to interpret and apply, could result in significant criminal penalties or sanctions that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We are involved from time to time in various legal and regulatory proceedings and claims, which could adversely affect our financial performance. We are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings and claims that, from time to time, are significant. These are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business including, without limitation, commercial or contractual disputes, including disputes with our customers, suppliers or competitors, intellectual property matters, personal injury claims, environmental matters, tax matters and employment matters. Such legal and regulatory proceedings could result in an adverse outcome for the Company that would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Tax matters, including changes in the corporate tax rates, disagreement with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could impact our results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and internationally. We are also subject to regular reviews, examinations, and audits by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities with respect to our taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken, we could face additional tax liability, including interest and penalties. There can be no assurance that payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes will not have a material impact on our result of operations and financial position. We also need to comply with new, evolving or revised tax laws and regulations. The enactment of or increases in tariffs, or other changes in the application or interpretation of tax legislation and other initiatives, or on specific products that we sell or with which our products compete, may have an adverse effect on our business or on our results of operations. The value of our deferred tax assets may not be realized, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results . As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $49 million in net deferred tax assets, inclusive of a $37 million valuation allowance. These deferred tax assets include net operating loss carryovers and tax credits that can be used to offset taxable income in future periods and reduce income taxes payable in those future periods. Each quarter, we determine the probability of the realization of deferred tax assets, using significant judgments and estimates with respect to, among other things, historical operating results and expectations of future earnings and tax planning strategies. If we determine in the future that there is not sufficient positive evidence to support the valuation of these assets, due to the risk factors described herein or other factors, we may be required to further adjust the valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets. Such a reduction could result in material non-cash expenses in the period in which the valuation allowance is adjusted and could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements. 27 We are required to comply with environmental laws and regulations that could cause us to incur significant costs. Our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect the environment, and we expect that additional requirements with respect to environmental matters will be imposed on us in the future. We may also assume, or be deemed to assume, significant environmental liabilities in acquisitions. Environmental liability may be imposed without regard to fault, and under certain circumstances, can be joint and several, resulting in one party being held responsible for the entire obligation. Material future expenditures may be necessary if compliance standards change or material unknown conditions that require remediation are discovered. Environmental laws could also restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses in connection with our business. Violations of these requirements could result in fines or sanctions, obligations to investigate or remediate contamination, third party property damage or personal injury claims due to the migration of contaminants off-site, or modification or revocation of our operating permits, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Financial Risks We are subject to significant foreign currency risk and foreign exchange exposure related to our global operations. A significant portion of our global transactions is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, including the Euro, the Chinese Renminbi, the Vietnamese Dong, the Hungarian Forint, the North Macedonian Denar, the Ukrainian Hryvnia, the South Korean Won and the Mexican Peso. While we sometimes employ financial instruments to hedge some of our transactional foreign exchange exposure, developing an effective and economical foreign currency risk strategy is complex and expensive and no strategy can completely insulate us from those exposures. Exchange rates can be volatile and could adversely affect our financial results and comparability of results from period to period. Such exchange rate volatility could also increase the costs of raw materials or components from foreign suppliers, and as a result, our profitability could be adversely affected. Our existing indebtedness and the inability to access capital markets could restrict our business activities or our ability to execute our strategic objectives or adversely affect our financial performance. As of December 31, 2022, our total consolidated indebtedness was $235.1 million, with $264.9 million available for additional borrowings under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement subject to specified conditions that Gentherm currently satisfies. In 2022, we incurred significant indebtedness in connection with our acquisitions of Alfmeier and Dacheng. We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future, including in connection with additional acquisitions or significant capital expenditures. If our outstanding borrowings increase, including under existing availability of revolving credit or if we incur additional indebtedness, the amount of our outstanding debt could have important, adverse consequences to us and our investors, including: Our debt agreements contain certain restrictive covenants and customary events of default. These restrictive covenants limit our ability to take certain actions, such as, among other things: incur additional debt, create liens, make certain payments or distributions (including for the repurchase or redemption of our shares), engage in mergers or consolidations, make certain dispositions and transfers of assets, enter into transactions with affiliates and guarantee indebtedness. While not unusual for financings of the type that we have, the restrictions in our credit facilities may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and may make it difficult for us to execute our business plans, take advantage of business opportunities, or react to changing industry conditions. To the extent that we incur additional indebtedness, the risks described above could increase. In addition, our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness depends upon our future performance. If our cash flow from operations is not sufficient to service our outstanding debt or to repay the 28 outstanding debt as it becomes due, we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to service or refinance our debt and we may have to reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures. The occurrence of any of such events could have a material adverse effect upon our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. If an event of default would occur under our existing debt agreements or any additional indebtedness, our lenders could declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable, which may cause cross-defaults under our other debt obligations. If our lenders accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness, we may not have sufficient capital available at that time to pay the amounts due to all lenders on a timely basis, and there is no guarantee that we would be able to repay, refinance, or restructure the payments on such debt. Further, under our existing credit facilities, the lenders would have the right to foreclose on certain of our assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We utilize various strategies to move funds between countries to manage global liquidity needs without material adverse tax consequences. Any repatriation of cash to the U.S. may result in various tax consequences and the movement of capital remains subject to evolving government regulation, which could have an adverse impact on our liquidity and cash flows. We continue to expect to be able to move funds between different countries to manage our global liquidity needs without material adverse tax implications, subject to current monetary policies and the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. We utilize a combination of strategies and currently there are no significant restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to Gentherm Incorporated. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries totaled $108.6 million. If additional non-U.S. cash was needed for our U.S. operations, we may be required to accrue and pay withholding if we were to distribute such funds from non-U.S. subsidiaries to the U.S. In addition, the movement of capital between our subsidiaries and us in different countries remains subject to evolving government regulation and geopolitical stability, and our liquidity and cash flows could be impacted adversely upon regulatory and geopolitical changes in the future. We are exposed to risks related to accounts receivable sales agreements. We have entered into several receivables factoring arrangements, including acquired in connection with the Alfmeier acquisition, that permit us to sell certain accounts receivable on a revolving basis, subject to outstanding balances and concentration limits. These agreements permit us to recover on our accounts receivable for specific customers sooner than if they were not in place and help reduce the risk of non-payment by such customers. A limited number of our customers participate in these programs to date. If we do not enter into these agreements, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by delays or failures in collecting trade accounts receivables for the applicable customers. In addition, if any of the financial institutions with which we have these agreements experiences financial difficulties or otherwise modifies or terminates these agreements, such modification, termination or other loss of these arrangements could have a material and adverse effect upon our liquidity and cash flows. We may be unable to realize the expected benefits of our restructuring actions, which could adversely affect our profitability and operations. We have undertaken significant restructuring activities in recent years that remain ongoing and may take future restructuring actions to realign and resize our production capacity and cost structure, lower our cost base, improve our financial performance and cash flow generation, and create a simplified organization best positioned to deliver on our key financial and operational priorities. Charges related to these actions or any further restructuring actions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We cannot ensure that any current or future restructuring will be completed as planned, on a timely basis or at all, will be on budget, or achieve the desired results. Common Stock Investment Risks The price of our Common Stock may fluctuate significantly. The price of our Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market has experienced substantial price volatility and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the automotive industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced significant stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance. Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future 29 growth, profitability, share repurchases or other market expectations, its stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention. On December 11, 2020, the Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program, pursuant to which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $150 million of common stock over a three-year period. Repurchases may be made, from time to time, in amounts and at prices the Company deems appropriate, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, debt covenants and other considerations. Any Company stock repurchases under the program may result in stock price and volume fluctuations. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company did not make any repurchases under the 2020 Stock Repurchase Program and have a remaining repurchase authorization of $130.0 million as of December 31, 2022. I TEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. I TEM 2. PROPERTIES As of December 31, 2022, we operate in over 32 locations across 14 countries, which are primarily for manufacturing, assembly, distribution, warehousing, engineering and testing. The majority of our Automotive facilities located outside of the U.S. are principally used in manufacturing and distribution and are located in China, Hungary, Mexico, North Macedonia, South Korea, Ukraine, Czech Republic, Germany, and Vietnam. Our global headquarters is located in Northville, Michigan, our European headquarters is located in Odelzhausen, Germany and our Asia-Pacific headquarters is located in Shanghai, China. Our Medical business is principally comprised of our headquarters and manufacturing site located in Cincinnati, Ohio and our manufacturing sites in Germany and China. We also have sales offices, warehouses and engineering centers, strategically located throughout the world. Nearly all of our manufacturing and distribution sites in Mexico and Asia are leased, while most of our European sites are owned. I TEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are subject to litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of our business, however, there is no current material pending litigation to which we are a party and no material legal proceedings were terminated, settled or otherwise resolved during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. I TEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES. Not applicable. 30 P ART II I TEM 5. MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT’S COMMON STOCK, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Market Information Our Common Stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “THRM.” Holders As of February 17, 2023, our Common Stock was held by 32 shareholders of record. A substantially greater number of holders are beneficial owners whose shares of record are held by banks, brokers and other nominees. Dividends We have not paid any Common Stock cash dividends since formation, and we do not expect to pay any in the foreseeable future. The payment of future dividends is within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon business conditions, our earnings and financial condition and other factors. Currently, our bank credit facilities limit payment of dividends on our Common Stock. Stock Repurchase Program In December 2020, the Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program (the “2020 Stock Repurchase Program”). pursuant to which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $150 million of its issued and outstanding common stock over a three-year period, expiring December 15, 2023. Repurchases under the 2020 Stock Repurchase Program may be made, from time to time, in amounts and at prices the Company deems appropriate, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, debt covenants and other considerations. Any such repurchases may be executed using open market purchases, privately negotiated agreements or other transactions (including Rule 10b5-1 trading plans), and may be funded from cash on hand, available borrowings or proceeds from potential debt or other capital markets sources. The 2020 Stock Repurchase Program may be modified, extended or terminated at any time without prior notice.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, our consolidated financial statements (and notes related thereto) and other more detailed financial information appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report. Further, you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. See also “Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I of this Annual Report. Overview Gentherm Incorporated is the global market leader of innovative thermal management and pneumatic comfort technologies for the automotive industry. Automotive products include variable temperature Climate Control Seats, heated automotive interior systems (including heated seats, steering wheels, armrests and other components), battery performance solutions, cable systems, lumbar and massage comfort solutions, valve system technologies, and other electronic devices. Medical products include patient temperature management systems. The Company is also developing a number of new technologies and products that will help enable improvements to existing products and will lead to new product applications for existing and new markets. Our automotive products can be found on vehicles manufactured by nearly all the major OEMs operating in North America and Europe, and several major OEMs in Asia. We operate in locations aligned with our major customers’ product strategies to provide locally enhanced design, integration and production capabilities. Our sales are driven by the number of vehicles produced by the OEMs, which is ultimately dependent on consumer demand for automotive vehicles, our product content per vehicle, and other factors that may limit or otherwise impact production by us, our supply chain and our customers. Historically, new vehicle demand and product content (i.e. vehicle features) have been driven by macroeconomic and other factors, such as interest rates, automotive manufacturer and dealer sales incentives, fuel prices, consumer confidence, employment levels, income growth trends and government and tax incentives. Vehicle content has also been driven by trends in consumer preferences, such as preferences for smart devices and features, personalized user experience, and comfort, health and wellness. Economic volatility or weakness, as well as geopolitical factors, in North America, Europe or Asia, have had and could result in a significant reduction in automotive sales and production by our customers, which have had and would have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Since 2020, the automotive industry has experienced fluctuating demand and production disruptions related to supply chain challenges, facility closures, labor shortages, work stoppages and inflationary pressures, as described below. We believe our diversified OEM customer base and geographic revenue base, along with our flexible cost structure, have well positioned us to withstand the impact of industry downturns and benefit from industry upturns in the ordinary course. However, shifts in the mix of global automotive production to higher cost regions or to vehicles that contain less of our product content as well as continuing production challenges and inflationary pressures could adversely impact our profitability. In addition, we may be adversely impacted by volatility or weakness in markets for hybrid or electric vehicles specifically. We believe our products offer certain advantages for hybrid and electric vehicles, including improved energy efficiency, and position us well to withstand changes in the volume mix between vehicles driven by internal combustion engines and hybrid and other electric vehicles. We believe our industry is increasingly progressing towards a focus on human comfort and health, which is evidenced by increasing adoption rates for comfort products. We believe that products we are developing, such as ClimateSense® and our acquisition of Alfmeier’s pneumatic comfort solutions, position us well to address trends in consumer preferences such as personalized user experience, comfort, health and wellness. Recent Trends General Macroeconomic and Geopolitical Conditions Since 2020, the global economy has experienced significant volatility and disrupted supply chains, which has had a widespread adverse effect on the global automotive industry. These macroeconomic conditions have resulted in longer lead times and delays in procuring component parts and raw materials, and resulted in inflationary cost increases in certain raw materials, labor and transportation. These broad-based inflationary impacts have negatively impacted the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Although we are optimistic that the worst of the global macroeconomic volatility is in the past, the direct and indirect impacts on our markets, operations, and financial performance have been unpredictable. As a result of this continued uncertainty, there may still be impacts on our industry, operations, workforce, supply chains, distribution systems, and demand for our products in the future which cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. 33 Additionally, the United States and global markets are experiencing volatility and disruption following the escalation of geopolitical tensions and the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine. In February 2022, Russia launched a full-scale military invasion of Ukraine. As a result of the conflict, the United States, United Kingdom, European Union and other countries have levied economic sanctions and bans on Russia and Russia has responded with its own retaliatory measures. These measures have impacted the price of certain raw materials and energy and could have a lasting impact on regional and global economies. Our facility in Vynohradiv is on the far western corner within the Transcarpathia region of Ukraine near the Hungary border. In 2022, products manufactured at our Ukraine facility represented approximately 8% of the Company’s total revenue, including automotive cables, seat heaters and steering wheel heaters, compared to 11% in 2021. At this time, our Ukraine facility is operating at normal levels and we continue to execute contingency plans and, in coordination with certain customers, specific equipment and production relocations leveraging our flexible global manufacturing footprint. Certain of our employees in Ukraine are routinely conscripted into the military and/or sent to the Russian border to fight in the ongoing conflict. We have incurred, and will likely continue to incur costs to support our employees and relocate equipment and production based on customer and company needs. Further, most of our products manufactured in Ukraine are shipped across the border from Ukraine to Hungary for further delivery to our customers. If that border crossing were to be closed or restricted for any reason, we may experience a significant disruption to our operations. Our response to the ongoing conflict is based on a severity level contingency response plan that has been developed with certain customers. As the situation in Ukraine is very fluid, we continue to monitor its effects on our business and we continue to work closely with our customers to adjust our contingency response as necessary. Supply shortages of semiconductor chips and other components have resulted in decreases in global automotive vehicle production and significant volatility in customer vehicle production schedules. The Company's semiconductor suppliers, along with most automotive component supply companies that use semiconductors, including Gentherm, have been unable to fully meet the vehicle production demands of the OEMs due to events which are outside the Company's control, including but not limited to, the COVID-19 pandemic, the global semiconductor shortage, fires at suppliers’ facilities, significant weather events impacting semiconductor supplier facilities in the southern United States, and other extraordinary events. The Company has experienced and may continue to experience direct impacts of ongoing shortages of semiconductors. Our ability to meet customer orders without significant delay and/or expense remains subject to significant uncertainty. Global inflation has increased significantly over the past year. Changing costs of freight, materials, equipment, labor and other inputs used to manufacture and sell our products and logistics costs, in particular, have impacted and may in the future impact operating costs and, accordingly, may affect the prices of our products. We are involved in continuing programs to mitigate the impact of cost increases through identification of sourcing and manufacturing efficiencies where possible. However, there have been, and there may still be, impacts we are not able to fully mitigate or pass through the increases in our operating costs. We are exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and remeasurement of the results of certain international operations into U.S. Dollars as part of the consolidation process. Therefore, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can create volatility in the results of operations and may adversely affect our financial condition. In response to the global supply chain instability and inflationary cost increases, the Company has taken several actions to minimize any potential and actual adverse impacts by working closely with its suppliers and customers to closely monitor the availability of semiconductor microchips and other component parts and raw materials, customer vehicle production schedules and any other supply chain inefficiencies that may arise. We expect global supply chain instability will continue to have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance for the foreseeable future, and such adverse impact may be material. The consequences of the pandemic, global supply chain instability and inflationary cost increases and their adverse impact to the global economy continue to evolve. Accordingly, the significance of the future adverse impact on our business and financial statements remains subject to significant uncertainty as of the date of this filing. Acquisitions On July 13, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Jiangmen Dacheng Medical Equipment Co. Ltd (“Dacheng”) and its wholly owned subsidiary, IOB Medical, Inc. Dacheng, a privately held manufacturer of medical materials and medical equipment, including patient temperature management solutions, for numerous local and international customers. The acquisition provides Gentherm Medical a local presence in China’s high-growth market for patient warming devices and other medical device products, while also expanding overall manufacturing capacity to include a low-cost manufacturing site. The total consideration for this acquisition was $35.0 million, which is comprised of cash payments, net of cash acquired. The purchase agreement also includes future cash payments of up to $3.0 million, contingent upon the achievement of certain performance metrics and continued 34 employment of the former majority shareholder through a series of defined dates. These contingent payments will be accounted for as compensation expense and will be recorded as a component of selling, general and administrative. On August 1, 2022, the Company acquired 100% of the equity interests of Alfmeier Präzision SE (“Alfmeier”) a global leader in automotive lumbar and massage comfort solutions and a leading provider of advanced valve systems technology, integrated electronics and software. The acquisition further expands the Company's current value proposition beyond thermal in comfort, health, wellness, and energy efficiency and aligns well with global consumer demand for expanded offerings in vehicle passenger comfort. The total consideration for this acquisition was $170.7 million. The Company made cash payments of approximately $170.4 million, net of cash acquired. See Note 4, “Acquisitions” of the consolidated financial statements included in this Report for additional information. Impairments – Non-Automotive Electronics Business On December 31, 2022, the Company approved a plan to exit its non-automotive electronics business to strengthen the Company’s core business and focus its resources and equipment with businesses and investments that are more strategic and profitable. The Company will continue to sell certain non-automotive electronics products until the exit is complete. The Company is evaluating a potential sale of the non-automotive electronics business or substantially all of its assets. If such sale is not pursued or is unsuccessful, the Company intends to wind-down the operations of the business over approximately eight to twelve months, subject to discussions with customers and suppliers. In the event of a wind-down, certain property, plant and equipment will be utilized by other operations of the Company. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded non-cash impairment charges of $9.4 million, $5.6 million and $0.7 million for write downs of inventory, intangible assets and property and equipment, respectively, within the Automotive segment. Write downs of inventory are recorded in Cost of sales. Write downs of intangible assets and property and equipment are recorded in Impairment of intangible assets and property and equipment. Light Vehicle Production Volumes Our sales are driven by the number of vehicles produced by the automotive manufacturers, which is ultimately dependent on consumer demand for automotive vehicles, and our content per vehicle, and other factors that may limit or otherwise impact production by us, our supply chain and our customers. According to the forecasting firm S&P Global Mobility (February 2023 release), global light vehicle production in 2022 in the Company’s key markets of North America, Europe, China, Japan and Korea, as compared to 2021, are shown below (in millions of units): 2022 2021 % Change North America 14.3 13.0 9.7 % Europe 15.8 15.9 (0.5 )% Greater China 26.4 24.8 6.3 % Japan / South Korea 11.2 10.9 2.6 % Total light vehicle production volume in key markets 67.7 64.7 4.7 % The S&P Global Mobility report (February 2023 release) forecasted light vehicle production volume in the Company’s key markets for full year 2023 to increase to 70.0 million units, a 3.4% increase from full year 2022 light vehicle production volumes. Forecasted light vehicle production volumes are a component of the data we use in forecasting future business. However, these forecasts generally are updated monthly, and future forecasts have been and may continue to be significantly different from period to period due to changes in macroeconomic conditions or matters specific to the automotive industry. Further, due to differences in regional product mix at our manufacturing facilities, as well as material production schedules from our customers for our products on specific vehicle programs, our future forecasted results do not directly correlate with the global and/or regional light vehicle production forecasts of S&P Global Mobility or other third-party sources. New Business Awards We believe that innovation is an important element to gaining market acceptance of our products and strengthening our market position. During 2022, we secured an estimated $1,793 million of automotive new business awards (inclusive of three full quarters of Alfmeier), which is at the high end of the range of new business awards in recent years. Automotive new business awards represent the aggregate projected lifetime revenue of new awards provided by our customers to Gentherm in the applicable period, with the 35 value based on the price and volume projections received from each customer as of the award date. Although automotive new business awards are not firm customer orders, we believe that new business awards are an indicator of future revenue. New business awards are not projections of revenue or future business as of December 31, 2022, the date of this Annual Report or any other date. Customer projections regularly change over time, and we do not update our calculation of any new business award after the date initially communicated. Automotive new business awards in 2022 also do not reflect, in particular, the impact of macroeconomic and geopolitical challenges on future business. Revenues resulting from automotive new business awards also are subject to additional risks and uncertainties as described in Item 1 under “Forward-Looking Statements” of this Annual Report. Reportable Segments The Company has two reportable segments for financial reporting purposes: Automotive and Medical. See Note 19, “Segment Reporting,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for a description of our reportable segments as well as their proportional contribution to the Company’s reported product revenues and operating income. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2021 This section discusses our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021.

The results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, in thousands, were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Favorable / (Unfavorable) Product revenues $ 1,204,656 $ 1,046,150 $ 158,506 Cost of sales 931,006 742,519 (188,487 ) Gross margin 273,650 303,631 (29,981 ) Operating expenses: Net research and development expenses 85,722 75,214 (10,508 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses 132,693 109,554 (23,139 ) Impairment of intangible assets and property and equipment 6,291 — (6,291 ) Restructuring expenses 637 3,857 3,220 Total operating expenses 225,343 188,625 (36,718 ) Operating income 48,307 115,006 (66,699 ) Interest expense, net (4,294 ) (2,758 ) (1,536 ) Foreign currency (loss) gain (6,778 ) 1,487 (8,265 ) Other income 1,147 117 1,030 Earnings before income tax 38,382 113,852 (75,470 ) Income tax expense 13,941 20,418 6,477 Net income $ 24,441 $ 93,434 $ (68,993 ) 36 Product revenues by product category, in thousands, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 % Change Climate Control Seat $ 426,046 $ 393,816 8.2 % Seat Heaters 283,970 270,054 5.2 % Steering Wheel Heaters 120,949 102,496 18.0 % Automotive Cables 76,962 84,114 (8.5 )% Battery Performance Solutions 71,907 69,594 3.3 % Electronics 44,106 51,648 (14.6 )% Lumbar and Massage Comfort Solutions (a) 56,980 — 100.0 % Valve System Technologies (a) 41,980 — 100.0 % Other Automotive 38,716 32,911 17.6 % Subtotal Automotive segment 1,161,616 1,004,633 15.6 % Medical segment (a) 43,040 41,517 3.7 % Total Company $ 1,204,656 $ 1,046,150 15.2 % Product Revenues Below is a summary of our Product revenues, in thousands, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: Year Ended December 31, Variance Due To: 2022 2021 Favorable / (Unfavorable) Automotive Volume FX Acquisition Pricing/ Other Total Product revenues $ 1,204,656 $ 1,046,150 $ 158,506 $ 108,356 $ (55,109 ) $ 102,322 $ 2,937 $ 158,506 Product revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased 15.2% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Revenue increased in all product categories except Electronics and Automotive Cables. The increase in product revenues is due to favorable volumes in our Automotive segment, the inclusion of sales from Alfmeier and Dacheng since the acquisitions, and the negotiation of lower annual price reductions and cost recoveries from customers, partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency impacts, primarily related to the Euro, Chinese Renminbi and Korean Won. Cost of Sales Below is a summary of our Cost of sales and Gross margin, in thousands, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: Year Ended December 31, Variance Due To: 2022 2021 Favorable / (Unfavorable) Automotive Volume FX Operational Performance Acquisitions and Other Total Cost of sales $ 931,006 $ 742,519 $ (188,487 ) $ (65,942 ) $ 30,778 $ (34,056 ) $ (119,267 ) $ (188,487 ) Gross margin 273,650 303,631 (29,981 ) $ 42,414 $ (24,331 ) $ (29,696 ) $ (18,368 ) $ (29,981 ) Gross margin - Percentage of product revenues 22.7 % 29.0 % Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased by 25.4% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase in cost of sales is primarily related to increased volumes in our Automotive segment, the inclusion of expenses from Alfmeier and Dacheng since the acquisitions, inflation associated with wages, higher transportation costs and material costs, and impairment recorded related to the exit of the non-automotive electronics business. These increases were partially offset by favorable foreign currency impacts primarily attributable to the Euro and Chinese Renminbi. 37 Net Research and Development Expenses Below is a summary of our Net research and development expenses, in thousands, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Favorable / (Unfavorable) Research and development expenses $ 105,914 $ 91,807 $ (14,107 ) Reimbursed research and development expenses (20,192 ) (16,593 ) 3,599 Net research and development expenses $ 85,722 $ 75,214 $ (10,508 ) Percentage of product revenues 7.1 % 7.2 % Net research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2022 increased 14% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021.

Income Tax Expense Below is a summary of our Income tax expense, in thousands, for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021: Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Favorable / (Unfavorable) Income tax expense $ 13,941 $ 20,418 $ 6,477 Income tax expense was $13.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022, on earnings before income tax of $38.4 million, representing an effective tax rate of 36.3 %. The effective tax rate differed from the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the unfavorable impact of the global intangible low-tax income (“GILTI”), withholding taxes, other non-deductible expenses and acquisition costs and uncertain tax positions, offset by certain favorable tax effects on equity vesting, research and development credits in various jurisdictions and the impact of income taxes on foreign earnings taxed at rates varying from the U.S. statutory rate. Income tax expense was $20.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, on earnings before income tax of $113.9 million, representing an effective tax rate of 17.9%. The effective tax rate differed from the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to 39 certain favorable tax effects on equity vesting, intercompany transactions during the year and the impact of income taxes on foreign earnings taxed at rates varying from the U.S. statutory rate, offset by the unfavorable impact of the GILTI, withholding taxes, other non-deductible expenses and uncertain tax positions. Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows from operations and borrowings available under our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Our cash requirements consist principally of working capital, capital expenditures, research and development, operating lease payments, income tax payments and general corporate purposes. We generally reinvest available cash flows from operations into our business, while opportunistically utilizing our authorized stock repurchase program. Further, we continuously evaluate acquisition and investment opportunities that will enhance our business strategies. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $153.9 million of cash and cash equivalents and $264.9 million of availability under our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. See Note 13, “Financial Instruments” of the consolidated financial statements included in this Report for details regarding our factoring arrangements. Significant changes in our liquidity occurred during July 2022 in connection with the close of the Alfmeier and Dacheng acquisitions. See ""Material Cash Requirements"" below for further information. We may issue debt or equity securities, which may provide an additional source of liquidity. However, there can be no assurance equity or debt financing will be available to us when we need it or, if available, the terms will be satisfactory to us and not dilutive to our then-current shareholders. We continue to expect to be able to move funds between different countries to manage our global liquidity needs without material adverse tax implications, subject to current monetary policies and the terms of the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. We utilize a combination of strategies, including dividends, cash pooling arrangements, intercompany loan repayments and other distributions and advances to provide the funds necessary to meet our global liquidity needs. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to Gentherm Incorporated. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries totaled approximately $108.6 million. If additional non-U.S. cash was needed for our U.S. operations, we may be required to accrue and pay withholding if we were to distribute such funds from non-U.S. subsidiaries to the U.S.; however, based on our current liquidity needs and strategies, we do not anticipate a need to accrue and pay such additional amounts. We currently believe that our cash and cash equivalents and borrowings available under our Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, receivables factoring arrangements, and cash flows from operations will be adequate to meet anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months and the foreseeable future. Cash and Cash Flows The table below summarizes our cash activity for each of the last two fiscal years (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period $ 190,606 $ 268,345 Net cash provided by operating activities 14,947 143,076 Net cash used in investing activities (239,899 ) (48,830 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 189,927 (169,141 ) Foreign currency effect on cash and cash equivalents (1,690 ) (2,844 ) Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 153,891 $ 190,606 40 Cash Flows From Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $14.9 million and $143.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Cash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 consisted primarily of net income of $24.4 million, increased by $51.8 million for non-cash charges for depreciation, amortization, non-cash stock based compensation, and loss on disposition of property and equipment, $15.9 million for inventory provisions, and impairments of intangible assets and property and equipment of $6.3 million related to the planned exit of the non-automotive electronics business, partially offset by non-cash charges of $7.3 million for deferred income taxes and other, and $76.9 million related to changes in assets and liabilities. Cash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 consisted primarily of net income of $93.4 million, increased by $54.3 million for non-cash charges for depreciation, amortization, non-cash stock based compensation, and loss on disposition of property and equipment, partially offset by non-cash charges of $0.5 million for deferred income taxes and other, and $4.2 million related to changes i1n assets and liabilities. Cash Flows From Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $239.9 million and $48.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The increase in usage is primarily attributable to payments for the Alfmeier and Dacheng acquisitions of $205.5 million and increases in the purchases of property and equipment during the year ended December 31, 2022 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2021. Cash Flows From Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities totaled $189.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and net cash used in financing activities totaled $169.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2022 primarily included $207.0 million of debt borrowings to fund acquisitions and $1.7 million of proceeds from the exercise of common stock options, partially offset by $13.1 million of debt repayments and $5.5 million paid for employee taxes related to the net settlement of restricted stock units that vested during the year. Cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily included $153.2 million of debt repayments, $20.0 million paid to repurchase common stock and $4.1 million paid for employee taxes related to the net settlement of restricted stock units that vested during the year, partially offset by $8.3 million of proceeds from the exercise of common stock options. Debt The following table summarizes the Company’s debt at December 31, 2022 and 2021 (dollars in thousands): December 31, 2022 2021 Interest Rate Principal Balance Interest Rate Principal Balance Credit Agreement: U.S. Revolving Note (U.S. Dollar denominations) 5.80 % $ 232,000 1.35 % $ 35,000 Other loans 3.89% - 5.21% 2,011 5.21 % 3,750 Finance leases N/A 1,085 N/A — Total debt 235,096 38,750 Current maturities (2,443 ) (2,500 ) Long-term debt, less current maturities $ 232,653 $ 36,250 Credit Agreement Gentherm, together with certain of its subsidiaries, maintain a revolving credit note (“U.S. Revolving Note”) under its Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement”) with a consortium of lenders and Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement was entered into on June 10, 2022 and amends and restates in its entirety the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated June 27, 2019, by and among Gentherm, certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries, the lenders party thereto and the Agent. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement has a maximum borrowing capacity of $500 million and matures on June 10, 2027. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains covenants, that, among other things, (i) prohibit or limit the ability of the borrowers and any material subsidiary to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, pay dividends, make certain types of investments (including 41 acquisitions), enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates, prepay other indebtedness, sell assets or enter into certain other transactions outside the ordinary course of business, and (ii) require that Gentherm maintain a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio and a maximum Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio (based on consolidated EBITDA for the applicable trailing four fiscal quarters) as of the end of any fiscal quarter. Finance Leases As of December 31, 2022, there was $1.1 million of outstanding finance leases. Other Sources of Liquidity Receivable Factoring The Company is party to receivable factoring agreements with unrelated third parties under which we can sell receivables for certain account debtors, on a revolving basis, subject to outstanding balances and concentration limits. The receivable factoring agreements are transferred in their entirety to the acquiring entities and are accounted for as a sale. Some of the agreements, including those assumed through the acquisition of Alfmeier, have deferred purchase price arrangements. See Note 13, “Financial Instruments” of the consolidated financial statements included in this Report for further details regarding our factoring arrangements. Material Cash Requirements The following table summarizes current and long-term material cash requirements as of December 31, 2022, which we expect to fund primarily with operating cash flows. Payments Due by Period Material Cash Requirements (in thousands) Total Less than 1 year 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 years More than 5 years Long-term debt obligations (1) $ 2,011 $ 2,011 $ — $ — $ — Operating lease obligations (2) 31,352 8,074 11,987 4,753 6,538 Finance lease obligations (2) 1,085 432 585 68 — Purchase obligations (3) 40,130 34,809 5,321 — — Capital commitments (4) 6,853 6,853 — — — Other 200 50 50 50 50 Total $ 81,631 $ 52,229 $ 17,943 $ 4,871 $ 6,588 Additional cash payments may be required for contingent payments of up to $3.0 million related to the Dacheng acquisition. See Note 4, ""Acquisitions,"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information about the purchase prices associated with recent acquisition transactions. 42 Other Commitments In December 2021, the Company committed to make a $5 million investment in Autotech Fund III, L.P., pursuant to a limited partnership agreement. As a limited partner, the Company will periodically make capital contributions toward this total commitment amount over the expected ten year life of the fund. The Company has made contributions of approximately $0.5 million to the Autotech Fund III, LP as of December 31, 2022. Timing of the capital contributions is unknown and therefore amounts have been excluded from the Material Cash Requirements table above. Capital Expenditures We anticipate capital expenditures in fiscal year 2023 of approximately $60 million to $70 million. We will continue support organic growth through capacity expansion in our facilities and make capital improvements as necessary. We believe cash on hand, cash generated from operations, and the borrowing capacity available under our Credit Agreement will be sufficient to support our capital expenditures. Stock Repurchase Program On December 11, 2020, the Board of Directors authorized the 2020 Stock Repurchase Program, pursuant to which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $150 million of its issued and outstanding common stock over a three-year period, expiring December 15, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company did not make any repurchases under the 2020 Stock Repurchase Program. The 2020 Stock Repurchase Program has $130 million of repurchase authorization remaining as of December 31, 2022. Repurchases may be made, from time to time, in amounts and at prices the Company deems appropriate, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, debt covenants and other considerations. Any such repurchases may be executed using open market purchases, privately negotiated agreements or other transactions. Repurchases may be funded from cash on hand, available borrowings or proceeds from potential debt or other capital markets sources. For further information related to our stock repurchase program, see Note 15, ""Equity"" in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. Effects of Inflation The automotive component supply industry has historically been subject to inflationary pressures with respect to materials and labor. In 2021 and continuing in 2022, macroeconomic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in inflationary cost increases in certain materials and components, labor and transportation. These inflationary cost increases are expected to continue for the foreseeable future as demand remains elevated and supply remains constrained. Although the Company has developed and implemented strategies to mitigate the impact of higher material component costs and transportation costs, these strategies, together with commercial negotiations with Gentherm's customers and suppliers have not fully offset to date and may not fully offset our future cost increases. Such inflationary cost increase may increase the cash required to fund our operations by a material amount. Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). In preparing these consolidated financial statements, management was required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are based on our historical experience, the terms of existing contracts, our evaluation of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers and suppliers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. These estimates and assumptions are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material to our financial statements. We have identified the following estimates as our most critical accounting estimates, which are those that are most important to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the Company’s financial condition and results of operations, and that require management’s most subjective and complex judgments. Information regarding our other significant accounting estimates and policies are disclosed in Note 2, ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"", of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. 43 Impairments of Goodwill Critical estimates: Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually as of December 31 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In conducting our annual impairment assessment testing, we first perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. If not, no further goodwill impairment testing is performed. If it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, or if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit, we then compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the related net book value. If the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. The Company utilizes an income approach to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit and a market valuation approach to further support this analysis. The income approach is based on projected debt-free cash flow that is discounted to the present value using discount factors that consider the timing and risk of cash flows. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based on the reporting unit’s expected long-term operating cash flow performance. This approach also mitigates the impact of cyclical trends that occur in our industry. Fair value is estimated using internally developed forecasts, as well as commercial and discount rate assumptions. The discount rate used is the value-weighted average of our estimated cost of equity and of debt (“cost of capital”) derived using both known and estimated customary market metrics. Our weighted average cost of capital is adjusted to reflect a risk factor, if necessary. Other significant assumptions include terminal value growth rates and terminal value margin rates. To further support the fair value estimate determined by the income approach, the Company utilizes a market valuation approach to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. The market approach considers historical and/or anticipated financial metrics of a reporting unit and applies valuation multiples based on recent observed transactions involving companies similar enough to the reporting units from which to draw meaningful conclusions. Judgments and uncertainties: These fair value calculations contain uncertainties as they require management to make assumptions about future cash flows and appropriate discount rates to reflect the risk inherent in the future cash flows and to derive a reasonable enterprise value and related premium. Our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies. The estimated future cash flows reflect management's latest assumptions of the financial projections based on current and anticipated competitive landscape, including estimates of revenue based on production volumes over the foreseeable future and long-term growth rates, and operating margins based on historical trends and future cost containment activities. Also, the market valuation approach is highly subjective as it requires the selection of comparable companies and valuation multiples. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions: As of December 31, 2022, our goodwill balance included $73.1 million related to our Automotive segment and $46.7 million related to our Medical segment. These balances could be fully or partially impaired if management does not achieve the expected cash flows assumed in the fair value estimates or if assumptions and cash flow estimates change in future periods. The Company’s Medical segment is comprised of one reporting unit (the “Medical Reporting Unit”). The estimated fair value of the Medical Reporting Unit exceeded its carrying value by less than 10% as of December 31, 2022. The Medical Reporting Unit is at risk of failing future impairment tests, as the estimate of fair value does not substantially exceed its carrying value. The Company’s estimated future cash flow projections for the Medical Reporting Unit for the period of 2023 through 2025 assume a compound annual growth rate for revenue of approximately 24%, which we deem to be a critical assumption in the fair value determination as of December 31, 2022. This forecasted revenue growth, which is significantly higher than historical periods, is primarily driven by anticipated product launches that are expected to increase volume and price due to new features and product capabilities. Realization of this assumed revenue growth is dependent on the successful launch of these new products and product features and the acceptance of customers. If this revenue growth is not achieved or if the estimated growth rates are reduced because of new information or experience, the fair value of the Medical Reporting Unit could decrease, which could result in a material impairment of goodwill. Additionally, forecasted cash flows assume margin expansion as a direct result of the forecasted revenue growth. If we experience higher costs than assumed in our forecast or if we experience other deviations from forecasted results and/or external factors (e.g., continued increasing of interest rates), it could result in a material impairment. For the reporting units of the Company’s recently acquired Alfmeier, the estimated fair values at the acquisition date were determined to approximate the estimated fair values as of December 31, 2022. The Company had no other material reporting units in 44 its Automotive segment with a fair value that was not substantially in excess of its respective carrying value as of the fourth quarter of 2022. Income Taxes Critical estimates: The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous international jurisdictions. In calculating our effective income tax rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. When determining whether we will be able to realize deferred tax assets, judgment is used to evaluate the positive and negative evidence, including forecasting taxable income using historical and future operating results. The provision for income taxes includes current income taxes as well as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the difference between the financial statement and tax base of assets and liabilities at the applicable enacted tax rates. Judgments and uncertainties: We have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions, based on our interpretation of local tax laws, supported by external advisor review for material positions. Valuation allowances are established when necessary on a jurisdictional basis to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized when management considers it more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be realized is based on the evaluation of positive and negative evidence, which includes historical profitability, future market growth, future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. The Company assesses deferred taxes and the adequacy or need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. The Company is subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions. At any time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities and a number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which a liability has been established, is audited and fully resolved or clarified. In evaluating the exposures associated with various tax filing positions, the Company may record liabilities for such exposures. The Company generally adjusts its liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related indemnification obligations through earnings in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position, or when more information becomes available. Although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and may materially increase or decrease the effective tax rate, as well as impact the Company’s operating results. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions: Some or all of management’s judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities. If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. Further, if the Company is unable to generate sufficient future taxable income, there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates, a change to the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, or if the tax laws change unfavorably, then the Company could be required to increase the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, resulting in an increase in income tax expense and the effective tax rate. For the year ended December 31, 2022, each change of the effective tax rate by one percentage point would impact income tax expense by $0.4 million. Business combinations Critical estimates: The Company allocates the cost of an acquired business to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The excess value of the cost of an acquired business over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed is recognized as goodwill. The valuation of the acquired assets and liabilities will impact the determination of future operating results. Judgments and uncertainties: The Company uses a variety of information sources to determine the value of acquired assets and liabilities including: third-party appraisers for the values and lives of property, identifiable intangibles and inventories. Goodwill is assigned to reporting units as of the date of the related acquisition. If goodwill is assigned to more than one reporting unit, the Company utilizes a method that is consistent with the manner in which the amount of goodwill in a business combination is determined. Costs related to the acquisition of a business are expensed as incurred. 45 The Company estimates the fair value of acquired customer relationships using the multi-period excess earnings method. Value is estimated as the present value of the benefits anticipated from ownership of the asset, in excess of the returns required on the investment in contributory assets which are necessary to realize those benefits. The intangible asset’s estimated earnings are determined as the residual earnings after quantifying estimated earnings from contributory assets. Assumptions used in these calculations are considered from a market participant perspective and include revenue growth rates, estimated earnings, contributory asset charges, customer attrition and discount rates. The Company estimates the fair value of trade names and developed technology using the relief from royalty method, which calculates the cost savings associated with owning rather than licensing the assets. Assumed royalty rates are applied to projected revenue for the remaining useful lives of the assets to estimate the royalty savings. Assumptions in the determination of the fair value of the developed technology included revenue growth rates, royalty rates, obsolescence factors and discount rates. Assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of the trade name included the revenue growth rates, the royalty rate and discount rate. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions: While the Company uses its best estimates and assumptions, fair value estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Any adjustments required after the measurement period are recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings. Future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our acquisition valuations and intangible asset and goodwill impairment testing, including discount rates or future operating results and related cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values in the future. An increase in discount rates, a reduction in projected cash flows or a combination of the two could lead to a reduction in the estimated fair values, which may result in impairment charges that could materially affect our financial statements in any given year. Recent Accounting Pronouncements For a complete description of recent accounting standards which we have not yet been required to implement which may be applicable to our operations, as well as significant accounting standards that have been adopted during the year ended December 31, 2022, see Note 3, “New Accounting Pronouncements,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. I TEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company is exposed to various market risks including, but not limited to, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in interest rates and price fluctuations of certain material commodities such as copper. Market risks for changes in interest rates relate primarily to the Company's debt obligations under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Foreign currency exchange risks are attributable to sales to foreign customers and purchases from foreign suppliers not denominated in a location’s functional currency, foreign plant operations, intercompany indebtedness, acquisitions denominated in foreign currencies, intercompany investments and include exposures to the Euro, Mexican Peso, Canadian Dollar, Hungarian Forint, North Macedonian Denar, Ukrainian Hryvnia, Japanese Yen, Chinese Renminbi, Korean Won, Czech Koruna and Vietnamese Dong. The Company regularly enters into derivative contracts with the objective of managing its financial and operational exposure arising from these risks by offsetting gains and losses on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the financial instruments used to hedge them. The decision of whether and when to execute derivative financial instruments, along with the duration of the instrument, may vary from period to period depending on market conditions, the relative costs of the instruments and capacity to hedge. The duration is linked to the timing of the underlying exposure, with the connection between the two being regularly monitored. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Some derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting; for other derivative contracts, we elect to not apply hedge accounting. The Company’s designated hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedge, and hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions both at the inception of a hedge and on an ongoing basis to be designated for hedge accounting treatment. For derivative contracts that can be classified as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is recorded to Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets. When the underlying hedge transaction is realized, the gain or loss included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss is recorded in earnings in the consolidated statements of income on the same line as the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. The Company records the ineffective portion of foreign currency and copper commodity hedging instruments, if any, to cost of sales, and the ineffective portion of interest rate swaps, if any, to interest expense in the consolidated 46 statements of income. Cash flows associated with derivatives are reported in net cash (used in) provided by operating activities in the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows. Information related to the fair values of all derivative instruments in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 is set forth in Note 13, “Financial Instruments” in the consolidated financial statements included in this Report. Interest Rate Sensitivity The table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates for each of the Company’s debt obligations, excluding finance leases. The information is presented in U.S. dollar equivalents, which is the Company’s reporting currency.

To hedge the Company's exposure to interest payment fluctuations on a portion of the borrowings, we entered into a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $100.0 million. Exchange Rate Sensitivity The table below provides information about the Company’s foreign currency forward exchange rate agreements that are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The table presents the notional amounts and weighted average exchange rates by expected (contractual) maturity dates for each type of foreign currency forward exchange agreement.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Management of the Company, under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2022. As defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (as amended, the “Exchange Act”), disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022. Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f), for the Company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on the framework set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).” Based on that evaluation, management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2022. Our acquisition of Dacheng became effective on July 13, 2022 and the acquisition of Alfmeier became effective on August 1, 2022. The Company currently is integrating Dacheng and Alfmeier into its operations, compliance programs and internal control processes. Dacheng and Alfmeier constituted approximately 4% and 27%, respectively, of the Company's total assets as of December 31, 2022, including the goodwill and other intangible assets recorded as part of the purchase price allocations, and less than 1% and 9%, respectively, of the Company's product revenues for the year ended December 31, 2022. SEC rules and regulations allow companies to exclude acquisitions from their assessment of internal control over financial reporting during the first year following an acquisition. The Company has excluded the acquired operations of Dacheng and Alfmeier from its assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The attestation report of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, regarding the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, is set forth in Item 15, ""Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules,"" included under the caption ""Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"". Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting In conjunction with our recent acquisition activity, we utilized our existing framework of internal control over financial reporting specific to business combinations. The applicable controls address the various elements of a business combination, including but not limited to: 1) calculation of the consideration transferred; 2) identifying and properly accounting for transactions that are separate from the business combination; 3) use and oversight of competent and qualified personnel in performing the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed; 4) review of inputs and outputs to the valuation models; 5) identifying and disclosing provisional amounts; and 6) tracking measurement period adjustments. 48 Except as described above with regard to the acquisition and integration of Alfmeier and Dacheng, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 24, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical audit matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the account or disclosure to which they relate. F- 2 Valuation of Goodwill – Medical Description of the Matter As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s goodwill related to the medical reporting unit (segment) was $46.7 million. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually as of December 31 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. Auditing management’s annual goodwill impairment assessment for the medical reporting unit was complex and highly judgmental due to the significant estimation required to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. In particular, the fair value estimates used in the valuation of the medical reporting unit were sensitive to significant assumptions, such as changes in the discount rate, revenue growth rates, including the terminal growth rate and operating margins, which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions. How We Addressed the Matter in our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s annual goodwill assessment, and annual forecasting process whereby the Company develops significant assumptions that are used in its analyses. This included controls over management's review of the valuation model and the significant assumptions used in the fair value measurements discussed above. To test the estimated fair value of the Company’s medical reporting unit, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the methodologies used and directly testing the significant assumptions and the underlying data used by the Company in its analysis, including assessing the completeness and accuracy of such underlying data. We utilized internal valuation specialists to assist in the evaluation of the assumptions and other relevant information that are most significant to the fair value estimate of the reporting unit, such as assessing the fair value methodologies applied and evaluating the reasonableness of the discount rate selected by management. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends, historical performance, guideline public companies in the same industry and strategic plans. We performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the reporting unit that would result from changes in the assumptions. Furthermore, we assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Valuation of Intangible Assets - Alfmeier Präzision SE (""Alfmeier"") Description of the Matter During 2022, the Company completed its acquisition of Alfmeier for net consideration of $170.7 million as disclosed in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. The acquisition was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting and accordingly tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded based on the respective estimated fair values. Auditing the Company's accounting for its acquisition of Alfmeier was complex due to the significant estimation required in the Company’s determination of the fair value of identified intangible assets of $31.5 million, which principally consisted of customer related assets and developed technology. The significant estimation uncertainty was primarily due to the sensitivity of the respective fair values to underlying assumptions about the future performance of the acquired business. The Company used a discounted cash flow model to measure the developed technology and customer relationship intangible assets. The significant assumptions used to estimate the value of the intangible assets included discount rates and certain assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results (e.g., revenue growth rates, customer platform renewal rates and royalty rates). These significant assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. F- 3 How We Addressed the Matter in our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s accounting for the recognition and measurement of the intangible assets. This included testing controls over management’s review of the fair value methodology and significant assumptions used to develop the estimates of fair value for those intangible assets. To test the estimated fair value of the technology and customer-related intangible assets, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, evaluating the Company's selection of the valuation methodology, evaluating the methods and significant assumptions used by the Company's valuation specialist, and evaluating the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions and estimates. We involved our valuation specialists to assist with our evaluation of the methodology used by the Company and significant assumptions included in the fair value estimates. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends, historical performance of the acquired entity, guideline public companies in the same industry and strategic plans. We performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the identified intangible assets. Furthermore, we assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. /s/ ERNST & YOUNG LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2020. Detroit, Michigan February 24, 2023 F- 4 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Gentherm Incorporated Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Gentherm Incorporated’s (the Company's) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria. As indicated in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management's assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of Alfmeier Präzision SE (“Alfmeier”) and Jiangmen Dacheng Medical Equipment Co. Ltd (“Dacheng”), which is included in the December 31, 2022 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted approximately 27% and 4% of total assets, respectively, as of December 31, 2022, and approximately 9% and 1% of revenues, respectively, for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Alfmeier and Dacheng. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 and our report dated February 24, 2023 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. F- 5 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ ERNST & YOUNG LLP Detroit, Michigan February 24, 2023 F- 6 GENTHERM INCORPORATED C ONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (In thousands, except share data)

per share data) Note 1 — Overview Gentherm Incorporated, a Michigan corporation, and its consolidated subsidiaries (“Gentherm”, “we”, “us”, “our” or the “Company”) is a global developer, manufacturer and marketer of innovative thermal management and pneumatic comfort technologies for a broad range of heating, cooling and temperature control applications, as well as lumbar and massage comfort solutions, primarily in the automotive and medical industries. Within the automotive industry, our products provide solutions for passenger comfort and convenience, battery thermal management and cell connecting systems. Within the medical industry our products provide patient temperature management solutions. Our automotive products can be found on vehicles manufactured by nearly all the major automotive original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) operating in North America and Europe, and several major OEMs in Asia. We operate in locations aligned with our major customers’ product strategies to provide locally enhanced design, integration and production capabilities. The Company also is developing a number of new technologies and products that are expected to enable improvements to existing products and will lead to new product applications for existing and new markets. On July 13, 2022, Gentherm acquired Jiangmen Dacheng Medical Equipment Co. Ltd (“Dacheng”), a manufacturer of medical materials and medical equipment, including patient temperature management solutions. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination within our Medical segment. On August 1, 2022, Gentherm acquired Alfmeier Präzision SE (“Alfmeier”), a global leader in automotive lumbar and massage comfort solutions and a leading provider of advanced valve systems technology, integrated electronics and software. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination within our Automotive segment. See Note 4, ""Acquisitions,"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information. Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly owned subsidiaries and those entities in which it has a controlling financial interest. The Company evaluates its relationship with other entities for consolidation and to identify whether such entities are variable interest entities (“VIE”) and to assess whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of such entities. Investments in affiliates in which Gentherm does not have control but does have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are accounted for under the equity method. When Gentherm does not have the ability to exercise significant influence (generally when ownership interest is less than 20 %), investments in affiliates are measured at cost, less impairments, adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Intercompany transactions and balances between consolidated businesses have been eliminated. Use of Estimates In preparing these consolidated financial statements, management was required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are based on our historical experience, the terms of existing contracts, our evaluation of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers and suppliers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. These estimates and assumptions are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. We are not presently aware of any events or circumstances that would require us to update such estimates and assumptions or revise the carrying value of our assets or liabilities. Our estimates may change, however, as new events F- 12 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) occur and additional information is obtained. As a result, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates, and any such differences may be material to our financial statements. Business combinations In accordance with ASC Topic 805, “Business Combinations,” acquisitions are recorded using the acquisition method of accounting. The Company includes the operating results of acquired entities from their respective dates of acquisition. The Company recognizes and measures the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest as of the acquisition date fair value. The excess, if any, of total consideration transferred in a business combination over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest is recognized as goodwill. Costs incurred as a result of a business combination other than costs related to the issuance of debt or equity securities are recorded in the period the costs are incurred. During the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, the Company may record adjustments to assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Segment Reporting The Company has two reportable segments: Automotive and Medical . The Automotive reporting segment is comprised of the results from our global automotive businesses, including the design, development, manufacturing and sales of automotive climate comfort systems, automotive cable systems, lumbar and massage comfort solutions, valve system technologies, battery performance solutions, and automotive electronic and software systems. The Medical reporting segment is comprised of the results from the patient temperature management business in the medical industry. Patient temperature management includes temperature management systems across multiple product categories addressing the needs of hyper-hypothermia therapy in intensive care, normothermia in surgical procedures and additional warming/cooling therapies utilized in acute care, ambulatory, clinics and home health. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized from agreements containing enforceable rights and obligations, when promised goods are delivered or services are completed. Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from Product revenues. Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are included in Product revenues, while costs of shipping and handling are included in Cost of sales. Automotive Revenues The Company provides production parts to its customers under long-term supply agreements (“LTAs”). The duration of an LTA is generally consistent with the life cycle of a vehicle; however, a LTA does not reach the level of a performance obligation until Gentherm receives either a purchase order and/or a materials release from its customer for a specific number of production parts at a specified price, at which point an enforceable contract exists. Revenue is recognized when control of the production parts has transferred to the customer according to the terms of the contract, which typically occurs when the parts are shipped or delivered to the customer’s premises. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring production parts. Certain LTAs provide for annual price reductions over the production life of the vehicle. Agreements that are determined to provide customers with purchase option discounts that would not be received without entering into the contract are considered to contain a material right (for example, a discount given to a customer that is incremental to the range of discounts typically given to that class of customer). The material right represents a purchase option that provides the customer with the ability to purchase additional production parts at a set price in the future and is accounted for as a separate performance obligation. Under these circumstances, each transfer of production parts under the LTA requires allocation of the purchase price to the production part and the purchase option. As a practical alternative to estimating the standalone selling price of an option, the Company allocates transaction F- 13 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) price to the purchase option by reference to the production part volumes expected to be ordered and the consideration expected to be received over the life of the vehicle program. The production part’s relative standalone selling price observed under the LTA is subtracted from the total amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring of parts under the current contract and the difference is allocated to the purchase option. Revenue from options containing a material right is recognized when the amounts billed to the customer for production parts transferred, under the LTA, is less than the standalone selling price of those production parts. Medical Revenues Revenues from our patient temperature management business unit are generated from the sale of products and equipment. Our medical products and equipment focus on body and blood temperature management. The Company sells medical products and equipment primarily through distributor and group purchasing organization agreements. These agreements allow member participants to the distributor or group purchasing organization to make purchases at discounted prices negotiated by the distributor or group purchasing organization. A rebate is incurred at the point in time a member participant purchases product covered under these types of agreements. Rebates are accounted for as variable consideration, using an expected value, probability weighted approach, based on the level of sales to the distributor and the time lag between the initial sale and the rebate claim in determining the transaction price of a contract. Revenue is recognized at the point in time the medical products or equipment is transferred to the customer. Assets Recognized from the Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer The Company has no material contract assets or contract liabilities as of December 31, 2022. The Company recognizes an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if the benefits of those costs are expected to be realized for a period greater than one year . Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were $ 2,239 and $ 1,946 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These amounts are recorded in Other non-current assets and are being amortized into Product revenues over the expected production life of the applicable program. During the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 , $ 78 and $ 174 , respectively, was amortized into Product revenues. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of less than 90 days to be cash equivalents. Cash balances in individual banks may exceed the federally insured limit by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Company had Cash and cash equivalents of $ 108,620 and $ 161,496 held in foreign jurisdictions as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 , respectively. Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of financial instruments comprising cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, notes receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the short maturities of these instruments. The carrying amount of the Company’s revolving credit note under the June 10, 2022 amended and restated credit agreement (“Credit Agreement”) approximates its fair value because interest charged on the loan balance is variable. See Note 14, “Fair Value Measurement,” for information about the techniques used to assess the fair value of financial assets and liabilities, including our fixed rate debt instruments. F- 14 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Concentration of Credit Risk Financial assets, which subject the Company to concentration of credit risk, consist primarily of cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable and notes receivable. Cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds managed by major financial services companies. The credit risk for these cash equivalents is considered low. The Company does not require collateral from its customers. As of December 31, 2022 , the Company’s Automotive customers, Adient and Lear both individually represented 18 % and 17 %, respectively, of the Company’s accounts receivable balance. As of December 31, 2021 , the Company’s Automotive customers, Adient and Lear both individually represented 22 % and 18 %, respectively, of the Company’s accounts receivable balance. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are stated at the invoiced amount, less allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated amounts not expected to be collected, and do not bear interest. The Company determines the allowances based on historical write-off experience by industry and regional economic data, current expectations of future credit losses and historical cash discounts. The Company’s accounts receivables are continually assessed for collectability and any allowance is recorded based upon the age of outstanding receivables, historical payment experience and customer creditworthiness. We write-off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $ 1,220 and $ 1,399 as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Balance at beginning of year $ 1,399 $ 1,161 $ 1,193 Charged to costs and expenses 1,088 1,066 1,298 Other activity - ( 12 ) 33 Deductions from reserves ( 1,267 ) ( 816 ) ( 1,363 ) Balance at end of year $ 1,220 $ 1,399 $ 1,161 Primarily in the Asia-Pacific region, the Company receives bank notes from certain customers to settle trade receivables. The collection of such bank notes is included in operating cash flows based on the substance of the underlying transactions, which are operating in nature. Bank notes held by the Company are classified as notes receivable within other current assets. The Company may hold such bank notes until maturity, exchange them with suppliers to settle liabilities, or sell them to third-party financial institutions in exchange for cash. Inventory The Company’s inventory is measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Raw materials, components and consumables are measured using the weighted average cost method. Work-in-process and finished goods are measured using the first-in first-out method. If the net realizable value expected on the reporting date is below cost, a write-down is recorded to adjust inventory to its net realizable value. We recognize a reserve for obsolete and slow-moving inventories based on estimates of future sales and an inventory item’s capacity to be repurposed for a different use. We consider the number of months' supply on hand based on current planned requirements, uncommitted future projections and historical usage in estimating the inventory reserve. Property and Equipment Property and equipment, including additions and improvements, are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for general repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. When property or equipment is retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts. Gains or losses from retirements and disposals are recorded as Operating income or expense. The Company evaluates the recoverability of long-lived assets when events and circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired and the undiscounted net cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying value. If the net carrying value exceeds the fair value, an impairment loss exists and is calculated based on either estimated salvage value or estimated orderly liquidation value. F- 15 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives of the Company’s Property and equipment are as follows: Asset Category Useful Life Buildings and improvements 1 to 30 years Plant and equipment 10 years Production tooling 2 to 10 years Leasehold improvements Term of lease Information technology 1 to 5 years The Company recognized depreciation expense of $ 33,730 , $ 29,622 and $ 31,037 for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 , respectively. Tooling The Company incurs costs related to tooling used in the manufacture of products sold to its customers. In some cases, the Company enters into contracts with its customers whereby the Company incurs the costs to design, develop and purchase tooling and is then reimbursed by the customer under a reimbursement contract. Tooling costs that will be reimbursed by customers are included in Other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at the lower of accumulated cost or the customer reimbursable amount. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021 , the Company had $ 15,267 and $ 3,778 , respectively, of reimbursable tooling costs capitalized. Company-owned tooling is included in Property and equipment and depreciated over its expected useful life, generally two to ten years . Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in conjunction with business combinations are based on the Company’s estimate of fair value, as of the date of acquisition. Amortization of other intangible assets is computed using the straight-line method. The fair value and corresponding useful lives for acquired intangible assets are listed below as follows: Asset Category Useful Life Customer relationships 8 to 15 years Technology 5 to 12 years Product development costs 5 to 10 years Trade names Indefinite Software development costs 4 to 5 years Our business strategy largely centers on designing products based upon internally developed and purchased technology, and we protect certain technology with patents that have value to our business strategy. All costs associated with the development and issuance of new patents are expensed as incurred. Such costs are classified as research and development expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. Impairments of Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually as of December 31 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In conducting our annual impairment assessment testing, we first perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. If not, no further goodwill impairment testing is performed. If it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, or if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit, we then compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the related net book value. If the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. F- 16 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) The Company utilizes an income approach to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit and a market valuation approach to further support this analysis (level 3). The income approach is based on projected debt-free cash flow that is discounted to the present value using discount factors that consider the timing and risk of cash flows. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based on the reporting unit’s expected long-term operating cash flow performance. This approach also mitigates the impact of cyclical trends that occur in our industry. Fair value is estimated using internally developed forecasts, as well as commercial and discount rate assumptions. The discount rate used is the value-weighted average of our estimated cost of equity and of debt (“cost of capital”) derived using both known and estimated customary market metrics. Our weighted average cost of capital is adjusted to reflect a risk factor, if necessary. Other significant assumptions include terminal value growth rates and terminal value margin rates. While there are inherent uncertainties related to the assumptions used and to management’s application of these assumptions to this analysis, we believe that the income approach provides a reasonable estimate of the fair value of a reporting unit. The Company performs its indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment annually as of December 31, and between annual assessments if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Investments in non-consolidated affiliates During 2021, the Company’s Automotive segment invested $ 5,200 for an ownership interest in Carrar Ltd. (“Carrar”), an Israel-based technology developer of advanced thermal management systems for the electric mobility market. The Company determined that Carrar is a VIE; however, the Company does not have a controlling financial interest or have the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of the investment. Therefore, the Company has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary. Gentherm’s investment in Carrar is measured at cost, less impairments, adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer, and is recorded in Other non-current assets. During 2021, the Company’s Automotive segment invested $ 2,357 for an ownership interest in Forciot Oy (“Forciot”), a Finland-based technology developer of sensors for touch, motion and force measurement. Gentherm’s investment in Forciot is measured at cost, less impairments, adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer, and is recorded in Other non-current assets. In December 2021, the Company committed to make a $ 5,000 investment in Autotech Fund III, L.P., pursuant to a limited partnership agreement. As a limited partner, the Company will periodically make capital contributions toward this total commitment amount over the expected ten-year life of the fund. The Company has made contributions totaling approximately $ 495 to the Autotech Fund III, LP as of December 31, 2022. This fund focuses broadly on the automotive industry and compliments the Company’s innovation strategy. Research and Development Expenses Research and development activities are expensed as incurred. The Company groups development and prototype costs and related reimbursements in research and development. Leases The Company has operating leases for office, manufacturing and research and development facilities, as well as land leases for certain manufacturing facilities that are accounted for as operating leases. We also have operating leases for office equipment and automobiles. Excluding land leases, our leases have remaining lease terms ranging from less than 1 year to 9 years and may include options to extend the lease. Land leases have remaining lease terms that range from 3 to 40 years and some which specify that the end of the lease term is at the discretion of the lessee. We do not have lease arrangements with related parties. F- 17 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) The Company determines whether a contractual arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Leases that are operating in nature are recognized in Operating lease right-of-use assets, Current lease liabilities and Non-current lease liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included in property and equipment, net, current maturities of long-term debt, and long-term debt on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Lease liabilities are measured initially at the present value of the sum of the future minimum rental payments at the commencement date of the lease. Lease payments that will vary in the future due to changes in facts and circumstances are excluded from the calculation of rental payments, unless those variable payments are based on an index or rate. Rental payments are discounted using an incremental borrowing rate, unless there is a rate implicit in the lease agreement. The incremental borrowing rate is based on the Company’s credit rating, determined on a fully collateralized loan basis from information available at commencement date, and the duration of the lease term (the “reference rate”). Judgment is used to assess the importance of risk factor inputs during the computation of the Company’s credit rating. For leases at foreign subsidiaries denominated in U.S. Dollars, a risk premium associated with the borrower subsidiary’s country is added to the reference rate. For significant leases at foreign subsidiaries denominated in a foreign currency, the U.S. Dollar risk free rate with a duration similar to that of the lease term is subtracted from the reference rate and a corresponding foreign currency risk free rate with a duration similar to that of the lease term is added to the reference rate. Operating lease right-of-use assets are measured at the amount of the lease liability, adjusted for prepaid or accrued lease payments, lease incentive received, and initial direct costs incurred, as applicable. Periods covered by an option to extend the lease are initially included in the measurement of an operating lease right-of-use asset and lease liability only when it is reasonably certain we will exercise the option. Gentherm’s lease agreements do not contain residual value guarantees or impose restrictions or covenants on the Company. For all classes of underlying assets, the Company accounts for leases that contain separate lease and non-lease components as containing a single lease component. The Company does not recognize lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities from leases with an original lease term of 12 months or less and, instead, recognizes rent payments on a straight-line basis over the lease term in the consolidated statements of income. Income Taxes The Company records income tax expense using the liability method which specifies that deferred tax assets and liabilities be measured each year based on the difference between the financial statement and tax base of assets and liabilities at the applicable enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when management considers it more likely than not that the asset will not be realized. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, a valuation allowance has been provided for certain deferred tax assets which the Company has concluded are more likely than not to not be realized. If future annual taxable income were to be significantly less than current and projected levels, there is a risk that certain of our deferred tax assets not already provided for by the valuation allowance would expire prior to utilization. The Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense. Derivative Financial Instruments – Hedge Accounting All derivative instruments are required to be reported on the balance sheet at fair value unless the transactions qualify and are designated as normal purchases or sales. Changes in fair value are reported currently through earnings unless they meet hedge accounting criteria. The Company’s designated hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedge, and hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions both at the inception of a hedge and on an ongoing basis to be designated for hedge accounting treatment. F- 18 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) The Company accounts for its designated derivative financial instruments as cash flow hedges. For derivative contracts which are designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative contract is recorded to Accumulated other comprehensive loss (“AOCI”) in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. When the underlying hedge transaction is realized, the gain or loss included in AOCI is recorded into earnings in the accompanying consolidated statements of income on the same line as the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. Any ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of income under Foreign currency gain (loss) for foreign currency derivatives, and cost of goods sold for commodity derivatives. These hedging transactions and the respective correlations meet the requirements for hedge accounting. Exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and certain commodity prices are managed by entering into swaps with various counterparties. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes. As part of the hedging program approval process, Gentherm identifies the specific financial risk which the derivative transaction will minimize, the appropriate hedging instrument to be used to reduce the risk and the correlation between the financial risk and the hedging instrument. Hedge positions, as well as the correlation between the transaction risks and the hedging instruments, are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the respective period. The Company’s diluted earnings per share give effect to all potential shares of common stock outstanding during a period that do not have an anti-dilutive impact to the calculation. In computing the number of diluted shares outstanding, the treasury stock method is used in order to arrive at a net number of shares created upon the conversion of common stock equivalents. Stock Based Compensation Share based payments that involve the issuance of common stock to employees, including grants of employee stock options, restricted stock, and time-based and performance-based restricted stock units, are recognized in the consolidated financial statements as compensation expense based upon the fair value on the date of grant. Share based payments that are satisfied only by the payment of cash, such as stock appreciation rights, are accounted for as liabilities. The liability is reported at market value of the vested portion of the underlying units. During each period, the change in the liability is recorded as compensation expense. F- 19 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Note 3 — New Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Reference Rate Reform In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting”. ASU 2020-04 provides practical expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The expedients and exceptions provided by the amendments in this update apply only to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate or another reference rate expected to be discontinued as a result of reference rate reform. These amendments are not applicable to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2022. In January 2021, the FASB subsequently issued ASU 2021-01, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope” to clarify that certain optional expedients and exceptions in Topic 848 for contract modifications and hedge accounting apply to derivatives that are affected by the discounting transition. ASU 2020-04 and ASU 2021-01 are effective as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022 and may be applied retrospectively to contract modifications and hedging relationships from the beginning of an interim period that includes or is subsequent to March 12, 2020, or on a prospective basis to new modifications from any date within an interim period that includes or is subsequent to the date of the issuance of a final update, up to the date that financial statements are available to be issued. Upon adoption of this standard, the Company does not expect it to have a material impact to the Company’s financial statements. Note 4 – Acquisitions Alfmeier Präzision SE On August 1, 2022 , the Company acquired 100 % of the equity interests of Alfmeier, a global leader in automotive lumbar and massage comfort solutions and a leading provider of advanced valve systems technology, integrated electronics and software. The acquisition further expands the Company's current value proposition beyond thermal to comfort, health, wellness, and energy efficiency and aligns with global consumer demand for expanded offerings in vehicle passenger comfort. The total consideration transferred was $ 170,700 , including cash consideration of $ 170,439 and amounts due to seller of $ 261 .

Note 5 — Restructuring and Impairments The Company continuously monitors market developments, industry trends and changing customer needs and in response, may undertake restructuring actions, as necessary, to execute management’s strategy, streamline operations and optimize the Company’s cost structure. Restructuring actions may include the realignment of existing manufacturing footprint, facility closures, or similar actions, either in the normal course of business or pursuant to significant restructuring programs. These actions may result in employees receiving voluntary or involuntary employee termination benefits, which are mainly statutory requirements or other contractual agreements. Voluntary termination benefits are accrued when an employee accepts the related offer. Involuntary termination benefits are accrued upon the commitment to a termination plan and when the benefit arrangement is communicated to affected employees, or when liabilities are determined to be probable and estimable, depending on the existence of a substantive plan for severance or termination. Manufacturing Footprint Rationalization During 2019, the Company committed to a restructuring plan (“Plan”) to improve the Company’s manufacturing productivity and rationalize its footprint. Under this Plan, the Company relocated and consolidated certain automotive electronics manufacturing plants in North America and China. During the year ended December 31, 2022 , the Company recognized restructuring expense of $ 56 for employee separation costs and $ 198 for other costs, primarily related to equipment move and set up costs. During the year ended December 31, 2021 , the Company recognized restructuring expense of $ 1,303 for employee separation costs and $ 1,665 for other costs, primarily related to equipment move and set up costs. During the year ended December 31, 2020 , the Company recognized restructuring expense of $( 832 ) for employee separation costs and $ 1,019 for other costs, primarily related to accelerated depreciation and equipment move and set up costs. The net activity for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily related to a reduction in the estimates of previously recognized employee separation costs. The Company has recorded approximately $ 10,359 of restructuring expenses since the inception of this program and as of December 31, 2022 , $ 588 remains accrued. Other Restructuring Activities The Company has undertaken several discrete restructuring actions. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 , the Company recognized $ 0 , $ 889 and $ 5,382 of employee separation costs, respectively, and $ 383 , $ 0 and $ 234 of other related costs, respectively.

The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement amended and restated in its entirety the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated June 27, 2019, by and among Gentherm, certain of its direct and indirect subsidiaries, the lenders party thereto and the Agent. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement provides for a $ 500,000 secured revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) (a $ 25,000 increase from the revolving credit facility under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement), with a $ 50,000 sublimit for swing line loans and a $ 15,000 sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit. Any amount of the facility utilized for swing line loans or letters of credit outstanding will reduce the amount available under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Company h ad no out standing letters of credit issued as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. Subject to specified conditions, Gentherm can increase the Revolving Credit Facility or incur secured term loans in an aggregate amount of up to $ 200,000 . The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement extended the maturity of the Revolving Credit Facility from June 27, 2024 to June 10, 2027 . The outstanding principal and interest (of approximately $ 35,000 as of June 10, 2022) under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement continued and remained obligations under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The U.S. borrowers and guarantors participating in the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also entered into a Second Amended and Restated Pledge and Security Agreement (the “Second Amended and Restated Security Agreement”). The Second Amended and Restated Security Agreement grants a security interest to the Agent in substantially all of the personal property of the Company and its U.S. subsidiaries designated as borrowers to secure their respective obligations under the Second Amended and Restated Security Agreement, including the stock and membership interests of specified subsidiaries (limited to 66 % of the stock in the case of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries). In addition to the security obligations, all obligations under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (including all obligations of any U.S. or non-U.S. loan party) are unconditionally guaranteed by certain of Gentherm’s domestic subsidiaries, and the German subsidiary borrowers and certain other foreign subsidiaries guarantee all obligations of the non-U.S. loan parties under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement restricts, among other things, the amount of dividend payments the Company can make to shareholders. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement contains covenants, that, among other things, (i) prohibit or limit the ability of the borrowers and any material subsidiary to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, pay dividends, make certain types of investments (including acquisitions), enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates, prepay other indebtedness, sell assets or enter into certain other transactions outside the ordinary course of business, and (ii) require that Gentherm maintain a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio and a maximum Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio (based on consolidated EBITDA for the applicable trailing four fiscal quarters) as of the end of any fiscal quarter. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with the terms of the Second F- 29 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. The Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement additionally contains customary events of default. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the amounts outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility may be accelerated and may become immediately due and payable. Under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, U.S. Dollar denominated loans bear interest at either a base rate (“Base Rate Loans”) or Term SOFR rate (“Term SOFR Rate Loans”), plus a margin (“Applicable Rate”). The rate for Base Rate Loans is equal to the highest of the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50 %, Bank of America’s prime rate, or the Term SOFR rate plus 1.00 %. The rate for Term SOFR Rate Loans denominated in U.S. Dollars is equal to the forward-looking Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) term rate administered by the CME with a term of one month. All loans denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar must be Term SOFR Rate Loans. Interest is payable at least quarterly. Additionally, a commitment fee of between 0.175 % to 0.300 %, which will vary based on the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, as defined in the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, is payable on the average daily unused amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility. The Applicable Rate varies based on the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio reported by the Company. As long as the Company is not in default of the terms and conditions of the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the lowest and highest possible Applicable Rate is 1.125 % and 2.125 %, respectively, for Term SOFR Rate Loans and 0.125 % and 1.125 %, respectively, for Base Rate Loans. Borrowing availability is subject to, among other things, the Company’s compliance with the minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio and the maximum Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio as of the end of any fiscal quarter. Based upon consolidated EBITDA for the trailing four fiscal quarters calculated for purposes of the Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, $ 264,904 remained available as of December 31, 2022 for additional borrowings under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement subject to specified conditions that Gentherm currently satisfies. In connection with the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the Company incurred debt issuance costs of $ 1,417 , which have been capitalized and will be amortized into interest expense over the term of the credit facility.

Actuarial gains or losses are amortized to Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income based on the average future life of the Plan using the corridor method. Prior service cost is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. Plan assets – German Plan Plan assets are comprised of Gentherm GmbH’s pension insurance policies and are pledged to the beneficiaries of the German Plan. A market valuation technique, based on observable underlying insurance charges, is used to determine the fair value of the pension plan assets (Level 2). The expected return on plan assets assumption used to calculate Gentherm GmbH’s pension benefit obligation was determined using actual returns realized on plan assets in the prior year. Contributions We do no t expect contribu tions to be paid to the U.S. Plan or the German Plan during the next fiscal year. The schedule of future expected pension payments is as follows: Projected Pension Benefit Payments Year U.S Plan German Plan 2023 $ 342 $ 311 2024 342 303 2025 342 294 2026 342 285 2027 342 274 2028-2031 1,710 2,732 Total $ 3,420 $ 4,199 Defined contribution plans The Company also sponsors defined contribution plans for eligible employees. On a discretionary basis, the Company matches a portion of the employee contributions and or makes additional discretionary contributions. Gentherm recognized costs of $ 1,984 , $ 1,724 and $ 1,275 related to contributions to its defined contribution plans during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 , respectively. Note 11 — Commitments and Contingencies Legal and other contingencies The Company may be subject to various legal actions and claims in the ordinary course of its business, including those arising out of breach of contracts, intellectual property rights, environmental matters, regulatory matters and employment-related matters. The Company establishes accruals for matters which it believes that losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these matters, the Company is of the opinion that the ultimate resolution of these F- 32 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) matters will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial position. Product liability and warranty reserves are recorded separately from legal reserves. Product Liability and Warranty Matters In the event that the Company’s products fail to perform as expected or result in alleged bodily injury or property damage, our products may subject us to warranty claims and product liability. If any of our products are or are alleged to be defective, we may be required to participate in a recall or other corrective action involving such products. The Company maintains liability insurance coverage at levels based on commercial norms and historical claims experience. The Company can provide no assurances that it will not experience material claims in the future or that it will not incur significant costs to defend such claims. The Company accrues warranty obligations for products sold based on management estimates of future failure rates and current claim cost experience, with support from the sales, engineering, quality and legal functions. Using historical information available to the Company, including claims already filed by customers, the warranty accrual is adjusted quarterly to reflect management’s best estimate of future claims. The following is a reconciliation of the changes in accrued warranty costs: Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Balance at beginning of year $ 1,916 $ 2,391 Warranty opening balance from acquired entities 907 - Warranty claims paid ( 1,841 ) ( 2,164 ) Warranty expense for products shipped during the current period 1,584 1,813 Adjustments to warranty estimates from prior periods ( 274 ) ( 73 ) Adjustments due to currency translation 88 ( 51 ) Balance at end of year $ 2,380 $ 1,916 Other matters Purchase commitments for materials, supplies, services and capital expenditures, as part of the normal course of business, are generally consistent from year to year. Commitments for capital expenditures as of December 31, 2022 were $ 6,853 . In addition, due to supply shortages of semiconductors, the Company has entered into agreements with various suppliers to reserve the right to purchase certain semiconductor chips over rolling periods of 12 - 24 months, with volume commitments determined based on our anticipated production requirements. As of December 31, 2022 , the Company’s total commitments for these semiconductor chip agreements was $ 40,130 . Such agreements provide the Company with priority access to semiconductor chips as they become available, however, these agreements do not guarantee that our suppliers will meet the timing and quantities requested by Gentherm. All other purchase commitments as of December 31, 2022 were immaterial. Employees Approximately 31 % of the Company’s workforce are members of industrial trade unions and are employed under the terms of various labor agreements. In 2023, certain agreements will require a vote on the terms of their respective labor contracts. Management does not anticipate any significant difficulties with respect to the renewal of these agreements. Note 12 — Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the period. The Company’s diluted earnings per share give effect to all potential shares of Common Stock outstanding during a period that do not have an anti-dilutive impact to the calculation. In computing the diluted earnings per share, the treasury stock method is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be issued from the exercise of Common Stock equivalents. F- 33 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) The following table illustrates earnings per share and the weighted average shares outstanding used in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share: Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Net income $ 24,441 $ 93,434 $ 59,690 Basic weighted average shares of Common Stock outstanding 33,126,202 33,085,732 32,666,025 Dilutive effect of stock options, restricted stock awards and restricted stock units 376,952 423,988 362,079 Diluted weighted average shares of Common Stock outstanding 33,503,154 33,509,720 33,028,104 Basic earnings per share $ 0.74 $ 2.82 $ 1.83 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.73 $ 2.79 $ 1.81 The following table represents Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of certain stock options that have been excluded from the diluted earnings calculation because the effect of their inclusion would be anti-dilutive. Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Anti-dilutive securities share impact — — 12,000 See Note 17 for information about the Company’s different equity incentive plans. Note 13 —Financial Instruments Derivative Financial Instruments The Company is exposed to various market risks including, but not limited to, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in interest rates and price fluctuations of certain material commodities such as copper. Market risks for changes in interest rates relate primarily to its debt obligations under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Foreign currency exchange risks are attributable to sales to foreign customers and purchases from foreign suppliers not denominated in a location’s functional currency, foreign plant operations, intercompany indebtedness, intercompany investments and include exposures to the Euro, Mexican Peso, Canadian Dollar, Hungarian Forint, North Macedonian Denar, Ukrainian Hryvnia, Japanese Yen, Chinese Renminbi, Korean Won, Czech Koruna and Vietnamese Dong. The Company regularly enters into derivative contracts with the objective of managing its financial and operational exposure arising from these risks by offsetting gains and losses on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the financial instruments used to hedge them. The decision of whether and when to execute derivative financial instruments, along with the duration of the instrument, may vary from period to period depending on market conditions, the relative costs of the instruments and capacity to hedge. The duration is linked to the timing of the underlying exposure, with the connection between the two being regularly monitored. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Some derivative contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting; for other derivative contracts, we elect to not apply hedge accounting. F- 34 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) The Company’s designated hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedge, and hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions both at the inception of a hedge and on an ongoing basis to be designated for hedge accounting treatment. For derivative contracts which can be classified as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is recorded to AOCI in the consolidated balance sheets. When the underlying hedge transaction is realized, the gain or loss included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss is recorded in earnings in the consolidated statements of income on the same line as the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. The Company records the ineffective portion of foreign currency and copper commodity hedging instruments, if any, to cost of sales, in the consolidated statements of income. Cash flows associated with derivatives are reported in net cash provided by operating activities in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company uses an income approach to value derivative instruments, analyzing quoted market prices to calculate the forward values and then discounting such forward values to the present value using benchmark rates at commonly quoted intervals for the instrument’s full term. In the second quarter of 2022, the Company entered into a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $ 100,000 . This interest rate swap is an undesignated hedge of the Company’s exposure to interest payment fluctuations on a portion of the Credit Facility borrowings that were drawn for the acquisitions of Alfmeier and Dacheng. The periodic changes in fair value are recognized in Interest expense, net. In the second and third quarter of 2022, the Company entered into forward contracts with a notional amount of $ 128,319 to hedge the foreign currency risk associated with the forecasted purchase of Alfmeier. These contracts matured and were settled in the third quarter of 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2022 the Company recognized expense of $ 3,806 in Foreign currency (loss) gain within the consolidated income statement. Information related to the recurring fair value measurement of derivative financial instruments in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022 is as follows: Asset Derivatives Liability Derivatives Fair Value Hierarchy Notional Amount Balance Sheet Location Fair Value Balance Sheet Location Fair Value Net Asset/ (Liabilities) Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow Hedges Foreign currency derivatives Level 2 $ 40,063 Other current assets $ 3,791 Other current liabilities $ — $ 3,791 Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Interest rate contracts Level 2 $ 100,000 Other current assets $ 2,772 Other current liabilities $ — $ 2,772 Information related to the recurring fair value measurement of derivative financial instruments in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 is as follows: Asset Derivatives Liability Derivatives Fair Value Hierarchy Notional Amount Balance Sheet Location Fair Value Balance Sheet Location Fair Value Net Asset/ (Liabilities) Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow Hedges Foreign currency derivatives Level 2 $ 13,974 Other current assets $ 294 Other current liabilities $ — $ 294 Commodity hedges Level 2 $ 309 Other current assets $ 6 Other current liabilities $ — $ 6 F- 35 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Information related to the effect of derivative instruments in the consolidated statements of income is as follows: Year Ended December 31, Location 2022 2021 2020 Derivatives Designated as Cash Flow Hedges Foreign currency derivatives Cost of sales – income $ 1,458 $ 1,609 $ ( 1,629 ) Other comprehensive (loss) income 3,496 ( 1,217 ) 272 Foreign currency loss — — ( 118 ) Total foreign currency derivatives $ 4,954 $ 392 $ ( 1,475 ) Commodity derivatives Cost of sales – income $ 19 $ 14 $ — Other comprehensive (loss) income ( 6 ) 6 — Total commodity derivatives $ 13 $ 20 $ — Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments Foreign currency derivatives Foreign currency (loss) gain $ ( 3,806 ) $ - $ - Total foreign currency derivatives $ ( 3,806 ) $ - $ - Interest rate contracts Interest income (expense), net $ 2,772 $ - $ - Total interest rate derivatives $ 2,772 $ - $ - The Com pany did no t incur any hedge ineffectiveness duri ng the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Accounts Receivable Factoring The Company sells certain customer trade receivables under factoring arrangements with designated financial institutions. All current factoring arrangements were assumed through the acquisition of Alfmeier. Beginning January 1, 2023, our North American factoring agreement is not active and the parties are currently undergoing negotiations in the ordinary course of business. Certain transactions occur under non-recourse agreements and are accounted for as sales, and the cash proceeds are included in cash provided by operating activities. The remaining transactions occur under deferred purchase agreements, in which a portion of the purchase price for the receivables is paid by the bank purchasers to the Company in cash upon sale. The remaining portion is recorded as a deferred purchase receivable, which is paid to the Company as payments on the receivables that are collected by the financial institution from account debtors. Cash proceeds received upon the sale of the receivables to the financial institution are included in cash provided by operating activities and the cash proceeds received on the deferred purchase receivables are included in cash provided by investing activities. All factoring arrangements incorporate customary representations, including representations as to validity of amounts due, completeness of performance obligations and absence of commercial disputes. During the year ended December 31, 2022 , we sold trade receivables totaling $ 61,482 and incurred factoring fees of $ 180 . As of December 31, 2022, receivables of $ 19,108 had been factored and had not yet been paid by customers to the respective financial institutions and our availability under the receivables factoring agreements was $ 5,479 . The collective limit under our factoring arrangements as of December 31, 2022 was $ 24,142 . F- 36 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Note 14 — Fair Value Measurement Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Fair value measurements are based on one or more of the following three valuation techniques: Market : This approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. Income : This approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present value amount based on current market expectations. Cost : This approach is based on the amount that would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset (replacement cost). The Company uses the following fair value hierarchy to measure fair value into three broad levels, which are described below: Level 1 : Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs. Level 2 : Inputs, other than quoted market prices included in Level 1, that are observable either directly or indirectly for the asset or liability. Level 3 : Unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs. Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Except for derivative financial instruments (see Note 13) and pension plan assets (see Note 10), the Company has no material financial assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value at December 31, 2022 and 2021. In determining fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible and also considers counterparty credit risk in its assessment of fair value. Items Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis The Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a non-recurring basis. As these nonrecurring fair value measurements are generally determined using unobservable inputs, these fair value measurements are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. On July 1, 2021 the Company acquired B&E for $ 2,827 . The purchase price was allocated to inventory (Level 2), property and equipment (Level 2) and other intangible assets (Level 3) based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The Company utilized a third-party to assist in the Level 3 fair value estimates of other intangible assets for recent acquisitions (see Note 4). The estimated fair values of these assets were based on third-party valuations and management’s estimates, generally utilizing income and market approaches. As of December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021 , there were no other significant assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Items Not Carried at Fair Value The Company uses an income valuation technique to measure the fair values of its debt instruments by converting amounts of future cash flows to a single present value amount using rates based on current market expectations (Level 2 inputs). As of December 31, 2022, and 2021, the carrying values of the indebtedness under the Company’s Credit Agreement were not materially different than their estimated fair values because the interest rates on variable rate debt approximated rates currently available to the Company (see Note 9). F- 37 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Note 15 — Equity Common Stock The Company is authorized to issue up to 59,991,000 shares, of which 55,000,000 shares shall be common stock, without par value, and 4,991,000 shall be Preferred Stock, without par value. As of December 31, 2022 , an aggregate of 33,202,082 shares of its common stock were issued and outstanding. As of December 31, 2022, the re are no pref erred stock shares issued or outstanding. The Company’s common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol, “THRM”, and has the following rights and privileges: Stock Repurchase Program In December 2020, the Board of Directors of Gentherm Incorporated (“Board of Directors”) authorized a stock repurchase program (the “2020 Stock Repurchase Program”) to commence upon expiration of the prior stock repurchase program on December 15, 2020. Under the 2020 Stock Repurchase Program, the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $ 150,000 of its issued and outstanding common stock over a three-year period, expiring December 15, 2023 . Repurchases may be made, from time to time, in amounts and at prices the Company deems appropriate, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, debt covenants and other considerations. Any such repurchases may be executed using open market purchases, privately negotiated agreements or other transactions. Repurchases may be funded from cash on hand, available borrowings or proceeds from potential debt or other capital markets sources. During the year ended December 31, 2022 , the Company did not make any repurchases under the 2020 Stock Repurchase Program. The 2020 Stock Repurchase Program had $ 130,000 repurchase authorization remaining as of December 31, 2022 .

See Note 13 for additional information about derivative financial instruments and the effects from reclassification to net income. Note 17 — Accounting for Stock Based Compensation On May 16, 2013, the Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved the Gentherm Incorporated 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2013 Plan”), covering 3,500,000 shares of our Common Stock. The 2013 Plan was amended on May 19, 2017 to increase the number of available shares by 2,000,000 and further amended on May 21, 2020 to increase the number of available shares by 2,450,000 . The 2013 Plan permits the granting of various awards including stock options (including both nonqualified options and incentive options), stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock and restricted stock units (“RSUs”), performance-based restricted stock units (“PSUs”) shares and certain other awards to employees, outside directors and consultants and advisors of the Company. As of December 31, 2022 , the Company had an aggregate of 2,216,324 shares of Common Stock available to issue under the 2013 Plan. All equity plans are administered by the Compensation and Talent Management Committee of the Board. During the three-year period ended December 31, 2022 , the Company has outstanding stock options, SARs, restricted stock awards and restricted stock units to employees, directors and consultants. These awards become available to the recipient upon the satisfaction of a vesting condition, either based on a period of service or based on the performance of a specific achievement. For equity-based awards with a service condition, the requisite service period typically ranges between three to four years for employees and consultants and one year for directors. As of December 31, 2022 , there were 320,449 PSUs outstanding. These awards cliff vest after three-years based on the Company’s achievement of either a target return on invested capital ratio (“ROIC”), as defined in the award agreement, for a specified fiscal year a target three year cumulative Adjusted EBITDA (“Adjusted EBITDA”), as defined in the award agreement, or the Company’s relative total shareholder return (“TSR”), as defined in the award agreement, during a specific three-year measurement period. In each case, awards will be earned at 50 % of the target number of shares for achieving a minimum threshold or up to 200 % of the target number of shares for exceeding the target, with a linear adjustment between threshold and target or between target and stretch performance goals. All other outstanding, unvested equity-based awards were service based. Equity-based award vesting may be accelerated at the discretion of the Board under conditions specified in the 2013 Plan. Under FASB ASC Topic 718, the provisions of the PSUs that vest upon the achievement of relative TSR are considered a market condition, and therefore the effect of that market condition is reflected in the grant date fair value for this portion award. A F- 40 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) third party was engaged to complete a Monte Carlo simulation to account for the market condition. That simulation takes into account the beginning stock price of our common stock, the expected volatilities for the relative TSR comparator group, the expected volatilities for the Company’s stock price, correlation coefficients, the expected risk-free rate of return and the expected dividend yield of the Company and the comparator group. The single grant-date fair value computed by this valuation method is recognized by the Company in accounting for the awards regardless of the actual future outcome of the relative TSR feature. The grant date fair value of the other PSUs and RSUs are calculated as the closing price of our common stock as quoted on Nasdaq on the grant date multiplied by the number of shares subject to the award. Each of ROIC and Adjusted EBITDA is considered a performance condition and the grant-date fair value for ROIC PSUs and Adjusted EBITDA PSUs corresponds with management's expectation of the probable outcome of the performance condition as of the grant date.

These earnings will be primarily treated as previously taxed income from either the one-time transition tax or global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) provision, or they will be offset with a 100 % dividend received deduction. However, the Company continues to provide a deferred tax liability for foreign income and withholding tax that will be incurred with respect to the undistributed foreign earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested.

The state NOL carryforwards generally expire at various dates from 2023 to 2042 . We have concluded that there is F- 45 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) not sufficient evidence these NOL carryforwards will be utilized, and thus have not recognized the benefit of these NOL carryforwards. At December 31, 2022 , certain non-U.S. subsidiaries had NOL carryforwards totaling $ 320,417 which have no expiration date . The Company has a valuation allowance recorded against $ 133,877 of the total non-U.S. subsidiaries’ net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2022. The Company is subject to taxation in the United States and various state and foreign jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2022, the Company was no longer subject to U.S. Federal examinations by tax authorities for tax years before 2019 and was no longer subject to foreign examinations by tax authorities for tax years before 2014. The Company currently benefits from tax holidays in various non-U.S. jurisdictions with expiration dates from 2024 – 2025. The amount of corporate income tax savings realized by the Company as a result of the tax holidays during the current and prior years was immaterial as a result of operating losses previously generated. At December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the Company had total unrecognized tax benefits of $ 6,185 , $ 5,665 and $ 4,967 , respectively, all of which, if recognized, would affect the effective income tax rates. The reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Balance at beginning of year $ 5,665 $ 4,967 $ 3,795 Additions based on tax position related to current year 972 1,105 1,489 Additions based on tax position related to prior year 433 160 179 Reductions from settlements and statute of limitation expiration ( 610 ) ( 312 ) $ ( 650 ) Effect of foreign currency translation ( 275 ) ( 255 ) 154 Balance at end of year $ 6,185 $ 5,665 $ 4,967 The Company classifies income tax-related penalties and net interest as income tax expense. In the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 , income tax related interest and penalties were not material. It is reasonably possible that audit settlements, the conclusions of current examinations or the expiration of the statute of limitations in several jurisdictions could impact the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits.

Impact of COVID-19, Supply Chain Disruptions and Other Matters The macroeconomic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to cause significant volatility in the global economy, including within the automotive market and our business. Our sales are driven by the number of vehicles produced by the automotive manufacturers, which is ultimately dependent on consumer demand for automotive vehicles, and our content per vehicle, and other factors that may limit or otherwise impact production by us, our supply chain and our customers. According to the forecasting firm IHS Markit (February 2022 release), global light vehicle production in 2021 in the Company’s key markets of North America, Europe, China, Japan and Korea, was up 0.3%, as compared to 2020. The lack of significant growth in 2021 was primarily due to the impacts of global supply chain disruptions, including the worldwide semiconductor supply shortage, and follows the significant decrease in vehicle production in 2020 which was driven by the adverse impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Light vehicle production remains well below recent historic levels and consumer demand. In 2021, the Company's semiconductor suppliers, along with most automotive component supply companies that use semiconductors, including Gentherm, were unable to fully meet the vehicle production demands of the OEMs largely due to events outside the control of the Company and its suppliers and customers, as well as the automotive industry generally. Supply shortages of semiconductor chips and other components not only resulted in decreased global automotive vehicle production but also caused significant volatility in customer vehicle production schedules. Sudden changes in the production schedules of OEMs and Tier 1s resulted in operating inefficiencies which adversely affect our profitability and results of operations. In addition, we experienced inflationary cost increases in certain component parts, raw materials, labor and transportation as a result of the supply-constrained environment and general economic conditions. These broad-based operational and inflationary impacts negatively impacted the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. In response to the global supply chain instability and inflationary cost increases the Company has taken several actions to minimize any potential and actual adverse impacts by working closely with its suppliers and customers to closely monitor the availability of semiconductor microchips and other component parts and raw materials, customer vehicle production schedules and any other supply chain inefficiencies that may arise. We expect global supply chain instability will continue to have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance for the foreseeable future, and such adverse impact may be material. The consequences of the pandemic, global supply chain instability and inflationary cost increases and their adverse impact to the global economy continue to evolve. Accordingly, the significance of the future adverse impact on our business and financial statements remains subject to significant uncertainty. See further discussion of the COVID-19 pandemic and related risks in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report.

Core Technologies Gentherm’s expertise in thermal management is focused on two general areas: managing the thermal conditions of people and objects. ClimateSense TM ClimateSense TM is an integrated comfort system we are designing to create a personalized microclimate for passengers using localized convective, conductive and radiative heating and cooling products. Using automatic regulation technology in combination with our unique occupant-centric control algorithm, ClimateSense TM offers the ability to personalize and improve overall occupant thermal comfort, improve time to comfort with (all-electric) pre-conditioning, provide comfort with less energy consumption thereby lowering carbon dioxide emissions by conventional internal combustion and hybrid powertrains, and extend range for electrified powertrains through a reduction in central heating, ventilation and air conditioning (“HVAC”) system usage. In July 2021, we received first production vehicle award for our ClimateSense TM technology on an all-new 2024 model year electric vehicle with a global automaker. Electronics The electronics in our core climate comfort solution products is manufactured by us. We also supply value-added electronic products to third parties for adjacent areas within the automotive interior. In addition, Gentherm manufacturers and supplies electronic control units for memory seat modules that include electric motor position sensing technology. This technology further applies to other automotive products requiring fine motor controls. Air Moving Devices Our highly durable and quiet air moving devices, some of which include our proprietary blower and fan designs, are essential to all of our products that require air movement. We have a strong portfolio of these products, tailored to various automotive application, including seat ventilation and electric vehicle battery cooling. 7 Thermoelectric Technologies Many of our thermal products manage the thermal conditions of people and objects using our internally developed advanced thermoelectric device technology (“TED”). A TED is a solid-state circuit that has the capability to produce both hot and cold thermal conditions by use of the Peltier effect. The advantages of advanced TED over conventional compressed gas systems are that they are environmentally friendly and less complex as they have no moving parts and are compact and light weight. Our work on this technology has yielded improvements in areas of functionality, efficiency, durability and performance. Resistive Heaters Resistive heater technologies are comprised of wire, carbon fiber or positive thermal coefficient (“PTC”) heating elements that quickly and effectively deliver heat to people and objects. Wire heating elements are designed from stainless steel, copper, our proprietary carbon fiber woven lattice technology called Carbotex® or printed circuit PTC heaters based on the specifications for a particular product application. Resistive heaters have multiple automotive applications, including seat heating, steering wheel heating, interior panel heating, and battery heating. Products Climate Comfort Solutions – Seat Comfort CCS Gentherm offers a range of CCS products utilizing proprietary technologies for regulating temperature and enhancing the comfort of vehicle passengers. Our ventilated CCS products move air through the seat to provide conditioning. Our active CCS products utilize TEDs to heat and cool air used to condition the seat. The conditioning air circulates by one of our specially designed air moving devices through an air distribution system installed in the seat cushion and seat back, so that the seat surface can be heated, ventilated or cooled. Each seat has individual electronic controls to adjust the level of heating, ventilating or cooling. Our CCS products improve comfort compared with conventional vehicle cabin air conditioners by focusing heating and cooling directly on the passenger through the seat. Our CCS products can be combined with our resistive heating elements to increase heating capacity and reduce time to comfort. By offering different models of the CCS product, our customers have the opportunity to purchase a wider range of climate control products at different price points. Sales of CCS products, primarily ventilated CCS products, contributed 38%, 38% and 37% to our total product revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Heated Seat Heated seats, based on our resistive heater core technology, are seamlessly integrated into automotive seat designs, and are constructed using materials that offer the best capacity, installation characteristics and durability. Our design and manufacturing capabilities allow customers to choose among a variety of resistive heater materials based on their individual vehicle specifications. Sales of heated seat products contributed 26%, 27% and 29% to our total product revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Neck Climate Control Systems Neck climate control systems ventilate warm or temperature-controlled air directly onto the passenger’s neck and shoulder area. The system combines electronics, air moving device technologies and a heating element into a compact, integrated headrest design that can be adjusted to suit the body size of the passenger. Climate Comfort Solutions – Surface Climate Control Systems Heated Steering Wheel Heated steering wheels deliver heating comfort to automobile drivers through resistive elements. This product can be applied to both leather and wood steering wheels. A solution for drivers in cold and mild weather climates, the heated steering wheel is designed for the global automotive market. 8 Heated Surfaces Gentherm’s thermally conductive or radiative surfaces, such as door panel armrest and center console armrest products, are powered by our core technologies. The system is thermally managed by a heating control system which can be discretely located in the door panel or seat of the vehicle. Heated door panels and armrests complement our climate-controlled seat and steering wheel products and provide a superior level of thermal comfort to the driving experience. Electronics Solutions Memory Seat Modules Gentherm has developed a unique way to control certain electrical motors in a vehicle. Our Intelligent Positioning System, IPS ® product suite utilizes proprietary software to determine the position of a power seat and control the memory seat module. Hands-On Detection All vehicles manufactured with autonomous driving level 2 or higher capabilities are required to ensure that the driver stays in control of the vehicle during operation. In order to accomplish this task, Gentherm developed PilotSense TM – a sensor integrated into the steering wheel that monitors whether the driver’s hands are maintaining contact with the steering wheel. This product is available for both heated and non-heated steering wheels. Battery Performance Solutions Cell Connecting Systems Cell connecting systems provide secure connections between advanced automotive batteries to transmit a continuous flow of information about battery temperature and cell voltage during the charging and discharging process to monitor battery system performance.

It can be custom designed to accommodate tight interior spaces, such as the front floor console of a sport utility vehicle and provide additional cooling capacity to those who have long work commutes or transport multiple passengers. Automotive Cable Systems Gentherm manufactures automotive cable systems used to connect automotive components to power sources. The automotive cable systems are an important element in the production of many of our products and form a significant component in how we generate value to our customers by being an efficient, low-cost and high-quality manufacturer. We offer cable systems as integrated parts of our products and also as stand-alone components for other automotive applications, such as oxygen sensors. Our cable systems business includes both ready-made individual cables and ready-to-install cable networks. Patient Temperature Management Systems Gentherm provides a full line of patient temperature management systems across multiple product categories addressing the needs of hyper-hypothermia therapy in intensive care, normothermia in surgical procedures and additional warming/cooling therapies utilized in acute care, ambulatory, clinics and home health. Our broad array of products for patient warming provides an improved patient experience and satisfaction. Our core brands include Blanketrol® hyper-hypothermia system, WarmAir®/FilteredFlo® convective warming system, Electri-Cool®/Micro-Temp® localized cooling/warming systems, the ASTOPAD® patient warming system that utilizes resistive warming technology which is also used in our automotive products, ASTOTHERM®/ASTOFLO® IV fluid and blood warming systems, ASTODIA® diaphanoscope for transillumination, Hemotherm® cardiovascular cooling/warming system and our recent launch of our next generation cardiovascular cooling/warming system utilized to deliver precise blood temperature control during cardiopulmonary by-pass and other related cardiovascular procedures. We aspire to have innovative patient temperature management product offerings coupled with clinical education enabling our customers to have enhanced patient outcomes and improved efficiencies of care. Customers Our Automotive segment customers include primarily light vehicle OEMs and Tier 1s, including automotive seat manufacturers. We also directly supply CCS products to aftermarket seat distributors and installers. The Company’s automotive marketing is directed primarily at the OEMs and their Tier 1s and focuses on the enhanced value consumers attribute to vehicles with climate comfort products. In many cases, the OEMs direct us to work with their suppliers, primarily their Tier 1s, to integrate our products into the vehicle’s seat or interior design. Once the integration work is complete, prototypes are sent to the OEMs for evaluation and testing. If an OEM accepts our product, a program can then be launched for a particular model on a production basis, but it normally takes one to three years from the time an OEM decides to include any of our products in a vehicle model to actual production for that vehicle. During this process, we derive funding from prototype sales but obtain no significant revenue until mass production begins. Upon commencement of mass production, our products are sold by Tier 1s to the OEMs as a component of an entire seat or seating system. Inherent to the automotive supplier market are costs and commitments that are incurred well in advance of the receipt of orders and resulting revenues from customers. The volume of products we sell is significantly affected by global and regional automotive production levels and the general business conditions in the automotive industry. Our product revenues are generally based upon purchase orders issued by our customers, with updated production schedules for volume adjustments. As such, we typically do not have a backlog of firm orders at any point in time. Once we are selected to supply products for a particular platform, we typically supply those products for the platform life, which is normally five to seven years, although there is no guarantee that this will occur. In addition, when we are the incumbent supplier to a given platform, we believe we have a competitive advantage in winning the redesign or replacement platform, although there is no guarantee that this will occur. 10 For 20 2 1 , our revenues from sales to our two largest customers, Adient plc (“Adient”) and Lear Corporation (“Lear”) were $ 15 6 million and $ 15 3 million , respectively, each representing 15 % of our product revenues that is consistent with prior years . Revenues from Lear and Adient represent sales of our climate comfort products. On October 28, 2021, Lear announced that it entered into an agreement to acquire the Interior Comfort Systems business unit of Kongsberg Automotive ASA, which is a key competitor of the Company’s climate comfort products, including CCS and seat heaters. The loss of these customers would likely have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and cash flows. However, as noted above, in many cases automotive OEMs direct their suppliers such as Lear and Adient to work with us for our climate comfort solutions, battery performance solutions and cable technology products. It is, therefore, relevant to understand how our revenues are divided among the OEMs, as shown below. Our total product revenues for each of the past three years were divided among the OEMs as follows: 2021 2020 2019 General Motors 14 % 14 % 14 % Hyundai 13 % 12 % 9 % Volkswagen 10 % 9 % 8 % Ford Motor Company 8 % 9 % 11 % Stellantis (a) 8 % 9 % 10 % BMW 6 % 6 % 6 % Honda 5 % 6 % 7 % Daimler 5 % 6 % 6 % Mazda 3 % 3 % 4 % Toyota Motor Corporation 3 % 3 % 4 % Renault/Nissan 3 % 2 % 3 % Jaguar/Land Rover 2 % 3 % 3 % Other (including Medical) 20 % 18 % 15 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % a) Reflective of the 2021 merger of Peugeot S.A. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles N.V. Market Trends We believe increased consumer demand for personalized thermal comfort in a vehicle is driving increased adoption of our comfort products.

Production and Suppliers Our global manufacturing and distribution facilities are located close to our key customers. In Automotive, we operate two manufacturing sites in Europe located within North Macedonia and Ukraine and one distribution center located in Hungary. In North America, we operate two manufacturing sites in Mexico. In Asia, we operate two manufacturing sites in China and one in Vietnam, and one distribution center in South Korea. For Medical, we operate one manufacturing site within Germany and one manufacturing site and distribution center within the United States. In September 2019, we committed to a restructuring plan (the “Plan”) to improve our manufacturing productivity and rationalize our footprint. Under this Plan, we planned to relocate and consolidate certain existing automotive manufacturing facilities and, as a result, reduce the number of our manufacturing facilities by two. In March 2020, we announced the initial phase of this Plan, which included the consolidation of all North American electronics manufacturing to Celaya, Mexico. This resulted in the closure of the Burlington, Canada facility, and the transfer of electronics manufacturing to Celaya, Mexico during 2021. In December 2020, we announced the consolidation of our electronics manufacturing in Asia to Bantian, Shenzhen, China, which resulted in the closure of our Longgang, Shenzhen, China facility during 2021. See Note 5, ""Restructuring,"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information. The automotive industry is highly reliant on semiconductors and, beginning in the fourth quarter 2020, throughout 2021 and continuing into 2022, is facing a significant supply shortage of semiconductors. See further discussion of the risks relating to the supply shortage of semiconductors and related risks above in “—Impact of COVID-19, Supply Chain Disruptions and Other Matters”, in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” and Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report. Proprietary Rights and Patents The development of new or improved technologies is critical to the execution of our business strategy. Currently owned patents and patents obtained for new or improved technologies form an important basis for the success of the Company and underpin the success of our research and development efforts. We have adopted a policy of obtaining, where practical, the exclusive rights to use technology related to our products through patents or licenses for proprietary technologies or processes. We adapt and commercialize such technologies in products for mass production. We also have developed technologies or furthered the development of acquired technologies through internal research and development efforts. As of December 31, 2021, Gentherm held 439 issued patents, of which 238 were U.S. patents and 201 were non-U.S. patents. Gentherm held 309 patents directed to climate control products (including 2 patents directed to ClimateSense TM ) and thermoelectric technologies, 41 patents directed to heating elements and technologies, 33 patents directed to battery cell connecting and cable technologies, 26 patents directed to medical technologies, 15 patents directed to air moving devices, and 15 patents directed to occupant sensing technologies. The Company continued to evaluate its patents during 2021 and made strategic decisions to reduce low-value patents and patents unrelated to current or planned business strategies. Competition See further discussion of the risks relating to competition in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report. Gentherm faces competition from other automotive suppliers and, with respect to certain products, from the OEMs and Tier 1s who manufacture or have the capability to manufacture certain products that Gentherm manufactures and supplies. The automotive supply industry competes on the basis of technology, quality, reliability of supply and price. Design, engineering capability and competitive pricing are increasingly important factors. The competitive landscape for Gentherm’s climate comfort solutions and battery sub-systems includes component specialists, thermal management system suppliers, the Tier 1s and the OEMs with their own integrated solutions. Independent suppliers that represent the principal competitors of Gentherm include I.G. Bauerhin GmbH and Kongsberg Automotive ASA. In October 2021, 12 Lear announced that it entered into an agreement to acquire the Interior Comfort Systems business unit of Kongsberg Automotive ASA. The competitive landscape for patient temperature management systems includes patient thermal management medical device manufactures . T he principal manufacturers of products similar to those of Gentherm ’s products include 3M Company , Stryker Corporation and Becton , Dickinson and Company . We believe our expertise in core thermal management technologies and vehicle occupant thermal comfort, as well as our capability in applying specific component design, global footprint and broad product offerings make us well positioned to compete against the traditional thermal management systems suppliers, global Tier 1s and component specialists. Seasonality Our principal operations are directly related to the automotive industry. Consequently, we have historically experienced seasonal fluctuations to the extent automotive vehicle production slows, such as in the summer months when many customer plants close for model year changeovers and in December when many customer plants close for the holidays. Human Capital Management Employees At Gentherm, our mission is to “ create and deliver extraordinary thermal solutions that make meaningful differences in everyday life, by improving health, wellness, comfort and energy efficiency .” Our people are the foundation for making our mission come to life every day. Our winning culture behaviors helps shape our core Human Resource programs and our culture, the behaviors are Customer Focus, Global Mindset, Performance & Accountability and Engagement & Inclusion. Our human capital strategy is to attract, develop and retain results-driven, high-performance talent while providing each employee with a compelling and personal employee experience. We also strive to promote a safe work environment and a culture the values fairness, diversity, equity, inclusion and belonging. Our global workforce creates a competitive advantage and operates in over 12 countries in 23 locations. As of December 31, 2021, and 2020, Gentherm’s employment levels worldwide were as follows: 2021 2020 Mexico 3,293 3,938 Ukraine 1,906 1,722 Macedonia 1,845 2,131 China 1,456 1,605 Vietnam 858 916 United States and Canada 488 618 Hungary 285 253 Germany 264 263 Korea 45 36 Japan 21 20 Malta 9 12 United Kingdom 4 5 Total 10,474 11,519 Notable statistics as of December 31, 2021: ▪ 36% of our workforce resides in North America; 41% of our workforce resides in Europe; 23% of our workforce resides in Asia. ▪ We have cooperative relationships in our facilities where we operate with unions and workers councils. Approximately 23% of the Company's workforce are members of industrial trade unions and are employed under the terms various labor agreements. 13 ▪ Three of nine Board members are female, and one is diverse. Four of ten executive committee members are female and two are diverse. ▪ Over 58% of our global workforce is Female. ▪ Within the United States, over 36% of our employees self-disclose as racially or ethnically diverse. Over the last year we increased our diversity representation at the leadership level (Directors and Vice Presidents) by three percentage points Racially and Ethnically Diverse (Self-reported) 2021 2020 All Employees 36 % 34 % Leadership 23 % 20 % Key Highlights of our Human Capital Strategy Gentherm’s Human Capital goals have evolved to a more flexible, personal, employee value proposition since the onset of the pandemic to ensure we are aiding our employees in navigating through the blurred demands of work and life. We introduced a new flexible working guideline called “ Locate for Your Day ”. In November 2021, we completed our first global engagement survey with a best-in-class response rate of 97%. The results of the survey in addition to several new listening tools help our managers continue to adapt and meet the needs of our workforce. Health and Safety At Gentherm, health and safety are an essential part of our culture and values. The “Safety Culture” of a workplace is a key issue for implementing and proceeding with the Vision Zero strategy. This initiative outlines a global approach and mindset that strives to eliminate all work accidents and injuries by aligning the Company culture with the Seven Golden Rules: 1. Leadership Commitment with a Top-Down Approach 2. Identify All Hazards and Risks 3. Set Safety and Health Targets 4. Ensure a Safety System/ Standards 5. Use Safe and Healthy Technology 6. Improve Qualification 7. Involve People The global operating health and safety team is not only committed to the Seven Golden Rules to eliminate work accidents and injuries. These rules also are focused on identifying hazards and unsafe behaviors before they happen by “near miss reporting”. Our teams have continued to benchmark across Gentherm sites which has fostered significant optimization and continuous improvement. By implementing consistent routine components in the daily work across all sites, the overall safety culture improves for all Gentherm operations. 14 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Our DE+I mission “Embracing Diversity Inspires Innovation” cascades from our corporate mission. We are building a culture of belonging where we value our differences to positively impact the lives of our employees, customers and communities. Our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Council, has built strong momentum in 2021. The DE+I council conducted engagement activities and enrichment programming each month to promote awareness and celebrate various ethnic and underrepresented employees within Gentherm. We took another step forward on our DE+I journey with launching inclusion trainings to all global people leaders with the purpose of building local and global awareness of DE+I at Gentherm, ensuring all team members are educated on consistent standards, identifying feedback mechanisms to solve for conflict, and creating a culture that unites us all. Total Rewards Gentherm’s compensation and benefits programs are designed to attract and retain our employees in the locations where we compete for talent using a mix of elements that allow us to achieve our Company’s short and long-term goals. ▪ We provide employee wages that are competitive and consistent with employee positions, skill levels, experience, knowledge and geographic location. ▪ We align our executives’ and eligible employees’ annual bonus opportunity and long-term equity compensation with our shareholders’ interests by linking realizable pay with company financial and stock performance. ▪ We are refreshing our overall compensation structure to ensure we are providing contemporary and equitable total rewards across our business. Total Talent Development At Gentherm, we provide foundational leadership development programs to ensure our current and future people leaders are well equipped to engage and lead in today’s complex business environment. Additionally, Gentherm’s performance management process is based on a contemporary coaching model where employees align yearly objectives with their leaders, supported with timely quarterly “check-ins” for progress updates and feedback. We have offered additional training programs to provide on-demand, flexible learning solutions for our global workforce. We introduced the Accelerator program for high potential employee development in 2021. Environmental, Social, and Governance In 2021, we issued our second Sustainability report and incorporated ESG into our everyday business operations and future strategies. Our sustainability efforts are based on three pillars: People, Planet, and Places. ▪ People: At Gentherm, our leaders treat employees with respect and provide a safe working environment. We provide career opportunities, development, support and more. People create our success. ▪ Planet: We strive to minimize our environmental impact. We believe our product lineup reduces the environmental impact of automobiles through our innovative products and technologies, and we continue to improve our operations through more efficient use of resources and reduced emissions. ▪ Places: As a global company, we strive to be a positive force in the communities where we do business. Our teams support an array of causes, including STEM education and training, financial support for local charities and donations and support for COVID-19 efforts. Types of community involvement and support vary across our sites, based on local needs, requirements, and culture. These actions indicate the strength of our commitment to sustainability across Gentherm. Environmental and Regulatory Compliance Applicable laws and regulations, and significant changes to such laws and regulations, will potentially lead to increases in costs and complexity, and failure to comply with global and specific country regulations could subject us to civil penalties, production 15 disruptions, or limitations on the sale of affected products. We believe we are materially in compliance with substantially all these requirements or expect to be materially in compliance by the required dates. Chemical Regulation There are numerous global laws and regulations that prohibit or restrict the selection and use of certain chemicals for product development and manufacturing and potentially impact an automobile manufacturer’s responsibility for vehicle components at the end of a vehicle’s life. New chemical regulations continue to be introduced and passed, such as the new European requirements that require suppliers of parts and vehicles to the European market to disclose certain substances of concern in parts. Further, increases in the use of circuit boards and other electronics may require additional assessment under the directives related to certain hazardous substances and waste from electrical and electronic equipment. Vehicle Safety In the U.S., the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (the “Safety Act”) regulates motor vehicle equipment that we manufacture and sell as well as vehicles. The Safety Act prohibits the sale in the United States of any new vehicle or equipment that does not conform to applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards established by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”). The Safety Act further requires that if a vehicle manufacturer or NHTSA determine a vehicle or an item of vehicle equipment does not comply with a safety standard, or that vehicle or equipment contains a defect that poses an unreasonable safety risk, the vehicle manufacturer must conduct a safety recall to remedy that condition in the affected vehicles. Should a vehicle manufacturer or NHTSA determine a safety defect or noncompliance issue exists with respect to any of our products, the cost of such recall campaigns could be substantial. Further, many other countries have established vehicle and vehicle equipment safety standards and regulations. Meeting or exceeding the many safety standards is costly as global compliance and non-governmental assessment requirements continue to evolve and grow more complex, and lack harmonization globally. 16 I TEM 1A. RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider each of the risks, assumptions, uncertainties and other factors described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, as well as any amendments or updates reflected in subsequent filings or furnishings with the SEC. We believe these risks, assumptions, uncertainties and other factors, individually or in the aggregate, could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results and could materially and adversely affect our business operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Industry and Operational Risks The COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken to contain it have significantly adversely affected, and are likely to continue to significantly adversely affect, our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and result in stock price volatility . The COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and continues to cause, a significant adverse effect on the level of economic activity around the world. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the governments of many countries, states, cities and other geographic regions have taken preventative or protective actions. The actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic have resulted in, and are expected to continue to result in, a curtailment of business activities (including changes in demand for a broad variety of goods and services), labor shortages, disruptions in supply, manufacturing and logistics, economic uncertainty and weakness, and volatility in the financial markets, both in the United States and abroad. The COVID-19 pandemic poses the risk that Gentherm or its suppliers, customers and others may be restricted or prevented from conducting business activities for indefinite or intermittent periods of time, including as a result of employee health and safety concerns, shutdowns, shelter in place orders, travel restrictions and other actions and restrictions that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. At various times in the first half of 2020, substantially all of the Company’s major OEM and Tier 1 customers temporarily ceased or significantly reduced production as a result of restrictions that were requested or mandated by governmental authorities. As a result, substantially all of our manufacturing facilities either temporarily suspended production or experienced significant reductions in volumes during this period. During 2021, the Company continued to see periodic, temporary mandates by governmental authorities that impacted our employees’ ability to travel to and from our manufacturing facilities, following the resurgence of COVID-19 in certain geographic areas. Restrictions on the Company’s access to its facilities and similar limitations for the Company’s customers, OEMs, suppliers and distributors, have had a material adverse impact on the business, financial condition and results of operations and could continue to have an impact in the future. Gentherm has implemented numerous measures attempting to manage and mitigate the effects of the virus, however, there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful now or in the future. Gentherm has modified its business practices and it may take further actions as may be required by government authorities, for the continued health and safety of the employees, or that the Company otherwise determines are in the best interests of the employees, customers, partners, and suppliers. The Company's management of the impact of COVID-19 has and will continue to require significant investment of time from its management and employees. The focus on managing and mitigating the impacts of COVID-19 on the business may cause the Company to divert or delay the application of its resources toward other or new initiatives or investments, which may cause a material adverse impact on the results of operations. If the COVID-19 pandemic becomes more pronounced in the markets in which the Company or its customers operate, or there is a continued resurgence in the virus in markets currently recovering from the spread of COVID-19, as we experienced with the emergence of the Delta and Omicron variants during 2021 and continuing into 2022, then the Company's operations in areas impacted by such events could experience further materially adverse financial impacts. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the Company's operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new government actions or restrictions, new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19, the longevity of COVID-19 and its variants and the impact of COVID-19 on economic activity. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the global economy creating certain macroeconomic conditions that make this a particularly challenging business environment for us and the automotive industry, including global supply chain instability, inflationary cost increases and labor shortages, as described in other risk factors in this Annual Report. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic materially adversely affects the Company's business and financial results, it may also have the effect of significantly heightening many of the other risks associated with the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and stock price, including in ways that we cannot predict. 17 The inability of our supply chain, and the supply chain of the OEMs and Tier 1s that we supply, to deliver key components, such as semiconductors, has adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect our business, profitability and results of operations. Our products contain a significant number of components that we source globally from suppliers who, in turn, source components from their global suppliers. If our supply chain fails to deliver products to us in sufficient quality and quantity on a timely basis, we will be challenged to meet our production schedules, fulfilling our orders, sales and profits could decline, and our commercial reputation and customer relationships could be damaged. Similarly, OEMs and Tier 1s to whom we supply our products are dependent on an ever-greater number of global suppliers to manufacture and sell their products to consumers, which drives sales of our products. We and our customers are currently operating in a supply-constrained environment and are facing, and we expect to continue to face for at least the first half of 2022 and potentially longer, component shortages, manufacturing disruptions, logistics challenges and inflationary pressures, each of which is described below. • Component shortages. The automotive industry is highly reliant on semiconductors and is facing a significant shortage of semiconductors. The semiconductor supply chain is complex, with capacity constraints occurring throughout. We, the OEMs and Tier 1s must compete among the automotive supply chain and with other industries to satisfy current and near-term requirements for semiconductors, and such allocation is not within our control even though we have attempted and will continue to attempt various mitigating actions. Certain semiconductors we utilize are sourced from a very limited number of suppliers, which further exacerbates the risks to our operations. The shortage of semiconductors and other key components (historically, such as TEDs), has disrupted our production schedule and has caused us to procure components on the open market, from time to time, at prices significantly above the contractual pricing we have with our current long-term suppliers. OEM and Tier 1 production has also been impacted by the shortage, which has resulted in reduced sales of our products. Sudden changes in the production schedules of OEMs and Tier 1s also has resulted and may continue to result in operating inefficiencies which could adversely affect our profitability and results of operations. The component shortages have had and may continue to have materially adverse effect on our business, profitability and results of operations. • Raw materials and component pricing. In addition to the component shortages we are currently experiencing, we have experienced and we may continue to experience risks associated with pricing of components and certain other raw materials. Some of our products contain certain components, such as semiconductor chips, tellurium, a raw material used in TEDs, and other key raw materials including copper, silver and petroleum-based engineered plastics and raw materials that generally cannot be substituted. The prices for these components and raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions. If the market prices for these components and raw materials significantly increase, as they have in the past and during the COVID-19 pandemic, our gross profit has and may continue to be adversely impacted to the extent our suppliers pass those price increases on to us. • Labor shortages and work stoppages. Labor shortages and work stoppages, including ours and those at our suppliers or customers, and similar events could significantly disrupt our business. Because the automotive industry relies heavily on “just-in-time” delivery of components, labor shortages or work stoppages at one or more of Gentherm's production facilities or those of our suppliers could have adverse effects on the business. Similarly, if one or more of our direct customers or an OEM were to experience labor shortages or work stoppages, such as what occurred during the General Motors labor strike occurring in the Fall of 2019 or the prolonged work stoppages that occurred in the first half of 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our customer would likely halt or limit purchases of our products, which could result in the temporary shutdown of the related Gentherm production facilities or other restructuring initiatives . • Inflationary pressures. The automotive industry has experienced a period of sustained price increases for various material components and shipping costs. These price increases are expected to continue into the foreseeable future as supply remains constrained and demand remains elevated. Although the Company has developed and implemented strategies to mitigate the impact of higher material component costs and shipping costs, these strategies, together with commercial negotiations with Gentherm's customers and suppliers, have not historically and may not in the future fully offset our price increases which may result in adverse impacts to the Company’s profitability and results of operations. • Logistics challenges and excess supply. In order to secure components for our products, we have and may continue to strategically purchase components in advance of demand to take advantage of favorable pricing or to address concerns about future availability. If we fail to anticipate customer demand properly, a temporary oversupply could result in excess or obsolete components, which could adversely affect our business and financial performance. In addition, our ongoing efforts to optimize the efficiency of our supply chain could cause supply disruptions and be more expensive, time-consuming and 18 resource-intensive than expected. Furthermore, certain of our suppliers may decide to discontinue business with us or limit the allocation of products to us, which could result in our inability to fill our supply needs, jeopardizing our ability to fulfill our contractual obligations, which could in turn, result in a decrease in revenues and profitability, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships. Our supply chain has been and may in the future be adversely impacted by other events outside of our and their control, including other macroeconomic events, trade restrictions, economic recessions, political crises, labor relations issues, liquidity constraints, natural disasters and extreme weather events, which may become more frequent due to climate change. The automotive industry, our primary market, is cyclical and a decline in the production levels of our major customers, particularly with respect to models for which we supply significant amounts of product, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our Automotive segment represents 96%, 95% and 95% of our product revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Demand for our automotive products is directly related to automotive vehicle production, which is ultimately dependent on consumer demand for automotive vehicles, our content per vehicle, and other factors that may limit or otherwise impact production by us, our supply chain and our customers. Automotive sales and production are cyclical and have been, and we expect will continue to be, materially affected by general economic and industry conditions, labor relations issues, fuel prices, regulatory requirements, government initiatives, trade agreements, the availability and cost of credit for us, customers and consumers and other factors. We operate in a highly competitive industry and efforts by our competitors, as well as new non-traditional entrants to the industry could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The automotive component supply industry is subject to intense competition. Business is typically awarded to the supplier offering the most favorable combination of cost, quality, timely delivery, technological innovation and service. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully with the products of our competitors. Further, our competitors’ efforts to grow market share could exert downward pressure on our product pricing and margins. Many of our competitors are substantially larger in size and have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do, and therefore may be more effective in adapting to customer requirements while being more profitable. In addition, our customers may increase levels of production insourcing for a variety of reasons, such as shifts in customers’ business strategies or the emergence of low-cost production opportunities in other countries, which may adversely affect our sales as well as the profit margins on our products. If we do not respond appropriately, the evolution of the automotive industry towards electric vehicles, autonomous vehicles and mobility on demand services could adversely affect our business. The global automotive industry is experiencing a period of significant technological change. Future automotive vehicle production may be affected by additional industry or consumer behaviors, including the development and use of autonomous and electric vehicles and increasing use of car and ridesharing and on-demand transportation as a service, as well as related regulations. The rapidly evolving nature of the markets in which we compete has attracted, and may continue to attract, new entrants, including new entrants from outside the traditional automotive supply industry. Further, in comparison to us, our competitors may foresee the course of market developments more accurately, develop superior products, produce similar products at a lower cost, or adapt quicker to new technologies. If we do not accurately predict, prepare for and respond to new kinds of technological innovations, market developments and changing customer needs, our sales, profitability and long-term competitiveness may be harmed. We manage our business based on projected future sales volume, which is highly dependent on information received from customers and general market data, and any inaccuracies or changes in such information could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We manage our business based upon projected future sales volumes, which are based upon many factors, including awarded business and assumptions of conversion rates thereof, customers’ forecasts and general market data. Our product revenues are generally based upon purchase orders issued by our customers, with updated production schedules for volume adjustments, and our customers generally do not guarantee sales volumes. As such, we typically do not have a backlog of firm orders at any point in time. In addition, awarded business may include business under arrangements that our customers have the right to terminate without penalty at any time. Further, our customers’ forecasts are subject to numerous assumptions, and such forecasts often are/may be changed 19 rapidly with limited notice. Therefore, our actual sales volumes, and thus the ultimate amount of revenue that we derive from such sales, are not committed. We also must incur costs and make commitments well in advance of the receipt of orders and resulting revenues from customers. If actual production orders from our customers are not consistent with our projected future sales volumes, we could realize substantially less revenue and incur greater expenses over the life of vehicle programs. The receipt of orders and resulting revenues from customers is significantly affected by global automotive production levels and the general business conditions in the automotive industry. Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including changes in demand for a broad variety of goods and services, labor shortages, inflationary pressures and a challenging and dynamic supply chain environment, has caused additional variability in customer purchase orders and caused customers to cancel their purchase orders, which has made it particularly challenging for us to project future sales volumes and manage our business in the current economic climate. The loss or insolvency of any of our principal customers would adversely affect our future results. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our top two customers were Adient and Lear which each comprised 15% of our product revenues. Combined, approximately 71% of product revenues to these customers was sourced directly by the Company’s OEM customers. The continued growth, viability and financial stability of our principal customers, as well as the OEMS to which our products are supplied, are critical to our success. The loss of any significant portion of our sales to any of our customers would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We sometimes experience, and we expect to continue to experience, a delay in our collection of accounts receivable balances from our customers, which may be significant and would be at risk in the event of their bankruptcy or other restructuring. On October 28, 2021, Lear announced that it entered into an agreement to acquire the Interior Comfort Systems business unit of Kongsberg Automotive ASA, which is a key competitor of our climate comfort products, including CCS and seat heaters. The effects of this acquisition are not yet known; however, a decrease in product revenues to Lear could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and the impact of any reduced relationship with Lear on the rest of our business is uncertain . Our inability to achieve product cost reductions which offset customer-imposed price reductions could adversely affect our financial performance. Downward pricing pressure is customarily applied by automotive manufacturers to the automotive supply chain. Our customer contracts generally provide for annual price reductions over the production life of the vehicle, while requiring us to assume significant responsibility for the design, development and engineering of our products, as well as the costs incurred through our supply chain. Prices may also be adjusted on an ongoing basis to reflect changes in product content/costs and other commercial factors. Our inability to achieve product cost reductions that offset customer-imposed price reductions could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our inability to effectively manage the development, timing, quality and costs of new product launches could adversely affect our financial performance. Gentherm is developing and launching new products and related technologies for its battery performance solutions and electronics systems businesses and intends to launch other new products in the future. The launch of products employing new technologies is a complex process, the success of which depends on a wide range of factors, including the robustness of our product and manufacturing process development, success in sourcing new components and commodities with suitable suppliers, readiness of our and our suppliers' manufacturing facilities and manufacturing processes, as well as factors related to tooling, equipment, employees, initial product quality and other factors. Given the complexity of new product launches, we may experience difficulties managing product quality, timeliness and associated costs. In addition, new program launches require a significant ramp up of costs up to a few years prior to sales of such products. However, our sales related to these new programs generally are dependent upon the timing and success of our customers’ introduction of new vehicles. Our inability to effectively manage the timing, quality and costs of these new program launches could have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. To the extent we are not able to successfully launch new business, vehicle production at our customers could be significantly delayed or shut down. Such operating failures could result in significant financial penalties to us or a diversion of personnel and financial resources to improving launches rather than investment in continuous process improvement or other growth initiatives, and 20 could result in our customers shifting work away from us to a competitor. Any of the foregoing matters could result in a significant loss of revenue and market shares and could have an adverse effect on our profitability and cash flows. We use important intellectual property in our business. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if a third party makes assertions against us or our customers relating to intellectual property rights, our business could be adversely affected . We own important intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets. Our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in many of the markets that we serve. We cannot guarantee, however, that we will be able to secure all desired protection, nor that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate, to prevent infringement of our rights or misappropriation or theft of our technology, trade secrets or know-how. For example, effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some of the countries in which we operate. In addition, while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our trade secrets, know-how, business strategy and other proprietary information, such confidentiality agreements could be breached or otherwise may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and know-how related to the design, manufacture or operation of our products. If it became necessary for us to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights, any proceedings could be burdensome and costly, and we may not prevail. Further, adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise. Finally, for those products in our portfolio that rely on patent protection, once a patent has expired, the product is generally open to competition. Products under patent protection usually generate higher revenues and profitability than those not protected by patents. If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could suffer, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, our competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies or design around the patents we own or license. Further, as we expand our operations in jurisdictions where the protection of intellectual property rights is less robust, the risk of others duplicating our proprietary technologies increases, despite efforts we undertake to protect them. Foreign governments may adopt regulations, and foreign governments or courts may render decisions, requiring compulsory licensing of intellectual property rights, or foreign governments may require products to meet standards that serve to favor local companies or provide reduced protection relative to other countries. Our ability to market our products successfully depends on acceptance of our products by existing and potential customers and consumers, as well as the success of our customers. We have been, and will continue to be, required to educate potential customers and demonstrate that the merits of our existing products justify the costs associated with them. Similar efforts will be required with existing and potential customers for additional products we develop using technologies we develop or license. Customers will only include our products if there appears to be consumer demand. For our automotive products, we rely on OEMs and applicable dealer networks to market our products to consumers, and we do not have any control over the marketing budget or messaging nor the training of employees and agents regarding our products. Further, OEMs and dealer networks may market products offered by our competitors, including products manufactured by such OEMs. If customers or consumers conclude that temperature control seats or our other automotive products are unnecessary or too expensive or that our competitors offer more favorable sales terms or better products, OEMs and other manufacturers may reduce availability or decline to include our products in their vehicles. Security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology networks and systems, including a disruption related to cybersecurity, could interfere with our operations and could compromise the confidentiality of our proprietary information or personal information. We rely on our information technology systems and networks in connection with many of our business activities. Some of these networks and systems are managed by third-party service providers and are not under our direct control. Our operations routinely involve receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business, customers, suppliers, employees and other sensitive matters. We rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our IT and data security infrastructure, as well as our ability to expand and continually update this infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business. If we experience a problem with the functioning of an important IT system or a security breach of our IT systems, due to failure to timely upgrade systems or during system upgrades and/or new system implementations, or resulting from failures of our third-party service providers, the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business. 21 As with most companies, we have experienced cyber-attacks, attempts to breach our systems and other similar incidents, none of which were material in 202 1 . Any future cyber incidents could, however, materially disrupt operational systems; result in loss of trade secrets or other proprietary or competitively sensitive information; compromise personally identifiable information regarding customers or employees; delay our ability to deliver products to customers; and jeopardize the security of our facilities. A cyber incident could be caused by malicious outsiders (including state-sponsored espionage or cyberwarfare) or insiders using sophisticated methods to circumvent firewalls, encryption and other security defenses. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Information technology security threats, including security breaches, computer malware, “ransomware” and other cyber-attacks, are increasing in both frequency and sophistication and could create financial liability, subject us to legal or regulatory sanctions or damage our reputation with customers, dealers, suppliers and other stakeholders. Many victims of ransomware are forced to pay significant ransoms to regain access to their critical business data , and we may not be permitted under various regulations and laws to make such payments . With some of our employees working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic, there may be increased opportunities for unauthorized access and cyber-attacks. Security breaches could also result in a violation of U.S. and international privacy and other laws and subject the Company to various litigations, investigations and proceedings. We continuously seek to maintain a robust program of information security and controls, but the impact of a material information technology event could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows . Despite our implementation of security measures, our IT systems, like those of other companies, are vulnerable to damages from computer viruses, natural disasters (which may become more frequent due to climate change), unauthorized access, cyber-attack and other similar disruptions. No IT system can be fully secure and impervious to all threats or failures. Any system failure, accident or security breach could result in disruptions to our operations. A material network breach in the security of our IT systems could include the theft of our intellectual property, trade secrets, customer information, human resources information or other confidential information. To the extent that any disruptions or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data, or an inappropriate disclosure of confidential, proprietary or customer information, it could cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with its customers, lead to claims against us, fines and other penalties assessed upon us by governmental authorities, and ultimately harm our business. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to remediate and protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future. Our business is subject to risks associated with manufacturing processes. If certain of our existing production facilities become incapable of manufacturing products or production capacity is limited for any reason, such as terror attacks, war, or other civil disturbances, natural disasters (which may be more frequent due to climate change), other catastrophic events, public health crises, labor shortages, work stoppages, or other events that cause facility closures or production disruptions, we may be unable to meet production requirements, sales and profits could decline, and our commercial reputation could be damaged. For example, we experienced extended work stoppages in the first half of 2020 as the pandemic spread and governmental authorities initiated “lock-down” orders for all non-essential activities. Without operation of certain existing production facilities, we may be limited in our ability to deliver products until we restore the manufacturing capability at the particular facility, find an alternative manufacturing facility or arrange an alternative source of supply. We maintain property damage insurance that we believe to be adequate to provide for reconstruction of facilities and equipment, as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from any production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss. However, any recovery under our insurance policies may not offset the lost sales, harm to our business reputation or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations. Further, any such proceeds may be received and accounted for in a different reporting period, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow generally or for a specific reporting period. If we fail to manage our growth effectively or to integrate successfully any new or future business ventures, acquisitions, investments or strategic alliance into our business, our business could be materially adversely harmed. We regularly consider opportunities to pursue business ventures, acquisitions, investments and strategic alliances that could leverage our products and capabilities, as well as, enhance our customer base, geographic penetration and scale, to complement our current businesses, some of which could be material. Finding and assessing a potential growth opportunity and completing a transaction involves extensive due diligence, management time and expense; however, the amount of information we can obtain about a potential growth opportunity may be limited. Further, we can give no assurance that new business ventures, acquisitions, 22 investments and strategic alliances will positively affect our financial performance or will perform as planned, including regarding anticipated synergies or other financial or operational benefits. We may not be able to successfully assimilate or integrate companies that we acquire, including personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations, internal controls and general operating procedures. Further, for significant transactions, we would expect to incur additional debt, issue equity and/or increase capital expenditures, which may increase leverage risks, result in dilution or reduce capital available for other investments in ongoing operations. If we fail to assimilate or integrate acquired companies successfully, our business, reputation and results of operations could be materially impacted. Likewise, our failure to integrate and manage acquired companies successfully may lead to future impairment of any associated goodwill and intangible asset balances. Given our limited history in the patient temperature management business, the foregoing risks may be heightened due to our lack of experience in integrating similar businesses. Our global operations subject us to risks that may harm our operations and financial results. In 2021, 61% of our product revenue was generated from sales to customers outside the United States. We have significant personnel, property, equipment and operations in a number of countries outside of the United States, including China, Germany, Hungary, North Macedonia, Mexico, South Korea, Ukraine and Vietnam. Our exposure to the risks described below is substantial. We also derive a significant portion of revenues from Europe and Asia and conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies. In addition to the general risks relating to our operations, our international operations are subject to unique risks inherent in doing business abroad, including: • exposure to local economic, political and labor conditions; • different and complex local laws and regulations and enforcement thereof, including those relating to governance, taxes, litigation, anti-corruption, employment, employee benefits, environmental, competition, permitting, investment, product regulations, repatriation, and export/import restrictions or requirements ; • increases in duties, tariffs and taxation on our products related to U.S. trade disputes; trade restrictions and potential trade wars, including limitation on imports or exports of components or assembled products, unilaterally or bilaterally; • exposure to infectious disease and epidemics, including the effects on our business operations, and those of our customers and suppliers, in geographic locations impacted by an outbreak, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; • violence and civil unrest (including acts of terrorism, drug-cartel related and other forms of violence and outbreaks of war); • expropriation, nationalization or other protectionist activities; • currency exchange rate fluctuations and currency controls; in particular, a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, including the Euro, the Chinese Renminbi, the Vietnamese Dong, the Hungarian Forint, the North Macedonian Denar, the Ukrainian Hryvnia, the South Korean Won and the Mexican Peso; • local business and cultural factors that differ from our customary standards and practices, including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in due to anti-corruption laws and regulations; and • ineffective legal protection of our intellectual property rights in certain countries. 23 Additionally, our primary manufacturing locations are in Mexico, China, Vietnam, North Macedonia and Ukraine, all countries that have historically experienced a heightened degree of political, civil and labor uncertainty. Political conflict and related demonstrations and violence in Ukraine in recent years, for example, highlights the risks to our foreign manufacturing facilities. Although our manufacturing facility in Ukraine is located approximately 700 miles by road from Kiev, and approximately the same distance from the activities along the border of Ukraine and Russia where fighting has occurred, we cannot be certain that similar demonstrations, unrest and international tensions will not affect our facility in the future, including due to electrical outages and periodic battles with separatists closer to our facility. In addition, certain of our employees in Ukraine are routinely conscripted into the military and/or sent to the Russian border to fight in the ongoing conflict. Furthermore, most of our products manufactured in Ukraine are shipped across the border from Ukraine to Hungary for further delivery to our customers. If that border crossing were to be closed or restricted for any reason, we would essentially experience a loss of the use of our Ukrainian facility, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. Defects or quality issues associated with our automotive and medical products could adversely affect the results of our operations. Our design, manufacture and marketing of automotive products may subject us to warranty claims and product liability in the event that our products fail to perform as expected and, in the case of product liability, such failure of our products results or is alleged to result in bodily injury or property damage. Any large product liability claims, if made, could exceed our insurance coverage limits and insurance may not continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, and we may incur significant costs to defend these claims. If any of our products are or are alleged to be defective, we also may be required to participate in a recall or other corrective action involving such products. Automotive manufacturers are increasingly looking to their suppliers for contribution when faced with recalls and product liability claims, as well as requiring their suppliers to guarantee or warrant their products and bear the costs of repair and replacement of such products under new vehicle warranties. OEMs historically have recalled vehicles for perceived defects in seat heaters, and we have incurred liabilities in connection with the recalls and other field actions. In addition, governmental regulatory agencies throughout the world, such as NHTSA in the U.S., have safety standards that require manufacturers to remedy defects related to vehicle safety through safety recall campaigns, and a manufacturer is obligated to recall vehicles if it determines that the vehicles do not comply with a safety standard. A recall claim brought against us that is not insured, or a product liability claim brought against us in excess of our available insurance, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and reputation or market acceptance of our products. In certain instances, allegedly defective products may be the result of components supplied by our supply chain, and we may be limited in our ability to obtain recovery from our suppliers of materials or services included within our products that are associated with product liability and warranty claims, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. The design, manufacture and marketing of medical products involve certain inherent risks. Manufacturing or design defects, component failures, unapproved or improper use of our products, or inadequate disclosure of risks or other information relating to the use of our products can lead to regulatory action, injury or other serious adverse events. These events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products (either voluntary or as required by the FDA or similar governmental authorities in other countries), and could result, in certain cases, in the removal of a product from the market. A recall, inadequate disclosure or defect could result in significant costs and lost sales and customers, enforcement actions and/or investigations by state and federal governments or other enforcement bodies, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce future demand for our products. Personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in significant product liability claims being brought against us. In some circumstances, such adverse events could also cause delays in regulatory approval of new products or the imposition of post-market approval requirements, such as further clinical testing. Such clinical testing is costly and time-consuming and could delay market approval or the meeting of additional post-market requirements. Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks Changes to trade policy, including tariffs and customs regulations, could have a material and adverse effect on our business. Existing free trade laws and regulations, such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, provide certain duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports, subject to compliance with the applicable classification and other requirements. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products, such as China and Mexico, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For instance, beginning in 2018, the U.S. and Chinese governments have imposed a series of significant incremental retaliatory tariffs to certain imported products. Most notably with respect to the automotive industry, the U.S. imposed tariffs on imports of certain steel, 24 aluminum and automotive components, and China imposed retaliatory tariffs on imports of U.S. vehicles and certain automotive components. Depending upon their duration and implementation, as well as our ability to mitigate their impact, these tariffs and other regulatory actions could materially affect our business, including in the form of increase d cost of goods sold, decreased margins, increased pricing for customers, and reduced sales . Tax matters, including changes in the corporate tax rates, disagreement with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could impact our results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and internationally. We are also subject to regular reviews, examinations, and audits by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities with respect to our taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken, we could face additional tax liability, including interest and penalties. There can be no assurance that payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes will not have a material impact on our result of operations and financial position. We also need to comply with new, evolving or revised tax laws and regulations. The enactment of or increases in tariffs, or other changes in the application or interpretation of tax legislation and other initiatives, or on specific products that we sell or with which our products compete, may have an adverse effect on our business or on our results of operations. The value of our deferred tax assets may not be realized, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results . As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $68 million in net deferred tax assets, inclusive of a $16 million valuation allowance. These deferred tax assets include net operating loss carryovers and tax credits that can be used to offset taxable income in future periods and reduce income taxes payable in those future periods. Each quarter, we determine the probability of the realization of deferred tax assets, using significant judgments and estimates with respect to, among other things, historical operating results and expectations of future earnings and tax planning strategies. If we determine in the future that there is not sufficient positive evidence to support the valuation of these assets, due to the risk factors described herein or other factors, we may be required to further adjust the valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets. Such a reduction could result in material non-cash expenses in the period in which the valuation allowance is adjusted and could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements. Our patient temperature management business is subject to extensive industry regulation and failure to comply with all applicable rules and regulation may adversely impact us. Our patient temperature management products are subject to extensive, complex, costly and evolving government regulation. In the United States, this is principally administered by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). Various regulatory agencies in foreign countries where our medical products are sold also regulate that business. Under both United States and foreign country regulations, we are subject to periodic inspection of our facilities (including third-party facilities that are performing services for us), procedures and operations and testing of our products. Following such FDA inspections, should any noncompliance with regulations or other quality issues be noted, we may receive observations, notices, citations and/or warning letters that could require us to get FDA approval of a corrective action plan and modify certain activities identified during the inspection, possibly at a significant cost. We are also required to report adverse events associated with our medical products to the FDA and other foreign regulatory authorities where our products have been approved or received market clearance. Unexpected or serious health or safety concerns could result in liability claims, recalls, market withdrawals or other regulatory actions. Changes in laws or regulations could require us to change the way we operate or to utilize resources to maintain compliance, which could increase costs or otherwise disrupt operations. In addition, failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations could result in fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses or, in rare circumstances, market withdrawal of the product. The process for obtaining governmental approval to manufacture and market new medical devices is time-consuming and costly. We are dependent on receiving FDA and other governmental or third-party approvals prior to manufacturing, marketing and shipping any new medical products. We cannot be certain that any new medical products we develop will receive FDA or other necessary approvals. Also receipt of approval in one country does not guarantee approval by the FDA or any other foreign regulatory agency. Any failure to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations could have a material and adverse effect on our reputation, business and financial results. Our operations outside of the United States require us to comply with various anti-bribery and anti-corruption regulations, including but not limited to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act and the China Anti-Unfair 25 Competition Law. Violations of these laws, which are complex and often difficult to interpret and apply, could result in significant criminal penalties or sanctions that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operat ions and cash flows. A significant product liability lawsuit, warranty claim or product recall involving us or one of our major customers, or an investigation regarding vehicle safety generally, could materially and adversely affect our financial performance. In the event that our products fail to perform as expected, whether allegedly due to our fault or that of one of our suppliers, and such failure results in, or is alleged to result in, bodily injury and/or property damage or other losses, we may be subject to product liability lawsuits and other claims, and we have been in the past and may again be required or requested by our customers or regulators to participate in a recall or other corrective action involving such products. We also are a party to agreements with certain of our customers, whereby these customers may pursue claims against us for contribution of all or a portion of the amounts sought in connection with product liability and warranty claims. We carry insurance for certain product liability claims, and have utilized such insurance periodically. However, such coverage may be limited for future claims. In addition, we may not be successful in recovering amounts from third parties, including suppliers, in connection with these claims. These types of claims could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. We are involved from time to time in various legal and regulatory proceedings and claims, which could adversely affect our financial performance. We are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings and claims that, from time to time, are significant. These are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business including, without limitation, commercial or contractual disputes, including disputes with our customers, suppliers or competitors, intellectual property matters, personal injury claims, environmental matters, tax matters and employment matters. Such legal and regulatory proceedings could result in an adverse outcome for the Company that would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely impacted from a decrease in or cessation or clawback of government incentives related to investments, workforce or production. We have received, and may receive economic benefits from national, state and local governments in various regions of the world in the form of incentives designed to encourage manufacturers to establish, maintain or increase investment, workforce or production. These incentives may take various forms, including grants, loan subsidies and tax abatements or credits. The impact of these incentives can be significant in a particular market during a reporting period. A decrease in, expiration without renewal of, or other cessation or clawback of government incentives for any of our business units, as a result of administrative decision or otherwise, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition, as well as our ability to fund new investments. We are required to comply with environmental laws and regulations that could cause us to incur significant costs. Our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect the environment, and we expect that additional requirements with respect to environmental matters will be imposed on us in the future. We may also assume, or be deemed to assume, significant environmental liabilities in acquisitions. Environmental liability may be imposed without regard to fault, and under certain circumstances, can be joint and several, resulting in one party being held responsible for the entire obligation. Material future expenditures may be necessary if compliance standards change or material unknown conditions that require remediation are discovered. No assurance can be given that all environmental liabilities have been identified or that no prior owner or operator of our properties or former properties has created an environmental condition not known to us. Environmental laws could also restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses in connection with our business. Violations of these requirements could result in fines or sanctions, obligations to investigate or remediate contamination, third party property damage or personal injury claims due to the migration of contaminants off-site, or modification or revocation of our operating permits, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, proposed and existing efforts to address climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions could directly or indirectly affect our costs of energy, materials, manufacturing, distribution, packaging and other operating costs, which could impact our business and financial results. Our business may be negatively impacted by regulatory and customer-imposed requirements to address climate change and other sustainability issues. As evidenced by shifting industry and consumer behaviors, including the development and use of electric vehicles, the automotive industry and consumers have a heightened focus on climate change and the environmental impact of product 26 manufacturing and end use . This increased focus on sustainability and the environmental impact of the automotive industry and manufacturing process es has caused our customers to impose additional requirements on us and our suppliers, which often exceed regulatory standards. These customer requirements include increased tracking and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental metrics , reduc ed waste and wastewater from operations, increased use of sustainable materials in our products, and the use of renewable energy sources in our factory operations. We expect to incur increased operating costs and capital expenditures to procure renewable energy and additional equipment or make operational and process changes to comply with customer requirements. To the extent we are unable to meet or exceed customer sustainability requirements, demand for our products and our revenues would be adversely impacted. We also expect that the increased focus on sustainability and climate change will result in new legislation or regulations at the federal, state or local level. Such legislative developments could adversely impact our business by increasing costs and could require us to make changes to our operations and result in substantial additional capital expenditures and operating costs. These additional costs, changes in operations, or loss of revenues could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. We may face particular privacy, data security and data protection risks. Legislators and/or regulators in countries in which we operate are increasingly adopting or revising privacy, information security and data protection laws. In particular, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective on May 25, 2018, imposes additional obligations and risk upon our business and which increases substantially the penalties to which we could be subject in the event of any non-compliance. The GDPR and other similar laws and regulations, including the new California Consumer Protection Act (“CCPA”) and other similar state laws recently or soon to be enacted, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions, may be costly to comply with, result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, and subject us to remedies that may harm our business, including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices. The CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020 and many of its requirements have not yet been interpreted by courts, and best practices are still being developed by the industry, all of which increase the risk of compliance failure and related adverse impacts. Furthermore, in November 2020, the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) was passed as a ballot measure. While many of the CPRA’s substantive modifications will not go into effect until 2023, they will require businesses to dedicate time and resources on compliance efforts, in some cases requiring new or modified practices and operations. Financial Risks Our existing indebtedness and the inability to access capital markets could restrict our business activities or our ability to execute our strategic objectives or adversely affect our financial performance. As of December 31, 2021, our total consolidated indebtedness was $38.8 million, with $440.0 million available for additional borrowings under the Credit Agreement subject to specified conditions that Gentherm currently satisfies. We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. If our outstanding borrowings increase, including under existing availability or if we incur additional indebtedness, the amount of our outstanding debt could have important, adverse consequences to us and our investors, including: • requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest payments; • making it more difficult to satisfy other obligations; • increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; • reducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow our businesses; • limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and industries; and • limiting our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise; Our debt agreements contain certain restrictive covenants and customary events of default. These restrictive covenants limit our ability to take certain actions, such as, among other things: incur additional debt, make certain payments or distributions (including for the repurchase or redemption of our shares), engage in mergers or consolidations, make certain dispositions and transfers of assets, enter into transactions with affiliates and guarantee indebtedness. While not unusual for financings of the type that we have, the restrictions in our credit facilities may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and 27 may make it difficult for us to execute our business plans, take advantage of business opportunities, or react to changing industry conditions. To the extent that we incur additional indebtedness, the risks described above could increase. In addition, our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. Our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to service our outstanding debt or to repay the outstanding debt as it becomes due, and we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to service or refinance our debt. If an event of default would occur under our existing debt agreements or any additional indebtedness, our lenders could declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable, which may cause cross-defaults under our other debt obligations. If our lenders accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness, we may not have sufficient capital available at that time to pay the amounts due to all lenders on a timely basis, and there is no guarantee that we would be able to repay, refinance, or restructure the payments on such debt. Further, under our existing credit facilities, the lenders would have the right to foreclose on certain of our assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition . An adverse change in the interest rates for our borrowings could adversely affect our financial condition. The publication of the one-week and two-month USD LIBOR maturities and non-USD LIBOR maturities ceased immediately after December 31, 2021, with the remaining USD LIBOR maturities ceasing immediately after June 30, 2023. Our current outstanding variable rate indebtedness uses LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate, and as of December 31, 2021, we had $35 million of variable rate debt tied to USD LIBOR under our First Lien Credit Agreement with maximum maturities extending past June 30, 2023. Under the terms of our Credit Agreement, the cessation of LIBOR or the announcement by the administrator of LIBOR or a governmental authority with jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent requires us to renegotiate or amend this agreement to select a replacement benchmark, which may adversely affect interest rates and result in higher borrowing costs. At this time, it is not possible to predict how markets will respond to Secured Overnight Financing Rate, or SOFR, the preferred alternative rate for LIBOR, or other alternative reference rates. We cannot predict the effect of the potential changes to or elimination of LIBOR, the use of SOFR or other alternative rates or benchmarks and the corresponding effects on our cost of capital. This could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. We cannot predict the effect of the potential changes to or elimination of LIBOR or the establishment and use of alternative rates or benchmarks and the corresponding effects on our cost of capital, but it may result in interest rates and/or payments that result in higher borrowing costs over time as compared to our borrowing costs if the USD LIBOR continued to be available. We are subject to significant foreign currency risk and foreign exchange exposure related to our global operations. A significant portion of our global transactions is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. While we sometimes employ financial instruments to hedge some of our transactional foreign exchange exposure, developing an effective and economical foreign currency risk strategy is complex and expensive and no strategy can completely insulate us from those exposures. Exchange rates can be volatile and could adversely affect our financial results and comparability of results from period to period. We may be unable to realize the expected benefits of our restructuring actions, which could adversely affect our profitability and operations. We have undertaken significant restructuring activities in recent years that remain ongoing, and may take future restructuring actions to realign and resize our production capacity and cost structure, lower our cost base, improve our financial performance and cash flow generation, and create a simplified organization best positioned to deliver on our key financial and operational priorities. Charges related to these actions or any further restructuring actions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We cannot ensure that any current or future restructuring will be completed as planned, on a timely basis or at all, will be on budget, or achieve the desired results. Common Stock Investment Risks The price of our Common Stock may fluctuate significantly. The price of our Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market has experienced substantial price volatility and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the automotive industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced significant stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these 28 companies’ operating performance. Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, share repurchases or other market expectations, its stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention. On December 11, 2020, the Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program, pursuant to which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $150 million of common stock over a three-year period. Repurchases may be made, from time to time, in amounts and at prices the Company deems appropriate, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, debt covenants and other considerations. Any Company stock repurchases under the program may result in stock price and volume fluctuations. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company repurchased approximately $20 million of shares under the 2020 Stock Repurchase Program with an average price paid per share of $83.44. The 2020 Stock Repurchase Program has $130 million of repurchase authorization remaining as of December 31, 2021. I TEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. I TEM 2. PROPERTIES As of December 31, 2021, we operate in over 23 locations across 12 countries, which are primarily for manufacturing, assembly, distribution, warehousing, engineering and testing . The majority of our Automotive facilities located outside of the U.S. are principally used in manufacturing and distribution and are located in China, Hungary, Mexico, North Macedonia, South Korea, Ukraine and Vietnam. Our global headquarters is located in Northville, Michigan, our European headquarters is located in Odelzhausen, Germany and our Asia-Pacific headquarters is located in Shanghai, China. Our Medical business is principally comprised of our headquarters and manufacturing site located in Cincinnati, Ohio and our manufacturing site in Germany. We also have sales offices, warehouses and engineering centers, strategically located throughout the world. Nearly all of our manufacturing and distribution sites in Mexico and Asia are leased, while most of our European sites are owned. I TEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We are subject to litigation from time to time in the ordinary course of our business, however there is no current material pending litigation to which we are a party and no material legal proceedings were terminated, settled or otherwise resolved during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.

MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT’S COMMON STOCK, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Market Information Our Common Stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “THRM.” Holders As of February 14, 2022, our Common Stock was held by 41 shareholders of record. A substantially greater number of holders are beneficial owners whose shares of record are held by banks, brokers and other nominees. Dividends We have not paid any Common Stock cash dividends since formation and we do not expect to pay any in the foreseeable future. The payment of future dividends is within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon business conditions, our earnings and financial condition and other factors. Currently, our bank credit facilities limit payment of dividends on our Common Stock. Stock Repurchase Program In December 2020, the Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program (the “2020 Stock Repurchase Program”). pursuant to which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $150 million of its issued and outstanding common stock over a three-year period, expiring December 15, 2023. Repurchases under the 2020 Stock Repurchase Program may be made, from time to time, in amounts and at prices the Company deems appropriate, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, debt covenants and other considerations. Any such repurchases may be executed using open market purchases, privately negotiated agreements or other transactions (including Rule 10b5-1 trading plans), and may be funded from cash on hand, available borrowings or proceeds from potential debt or other capital markets sources. The 2020 Stock Repurchase Program may be modified, extended or terminated at any time without prior notice.

Within the medical industry our products provide patient temperature management solutions. Our automotive products can be found on vehicles manufactured by nearly all the major OEMs operating in North America and Europe, and several major OEMs in Asia. We operate in locations aligned with our major customers’ product strategies to provide locally enhanced design, integration and production capabilities. The Company is also developing a number of new technologies and products that are expected to enable improvements to existing products and to create new product applications for existing and new markets. Our sales are driven by the number of vehicles produced by the OEMs, which is ultimately dependent on consumer demand for automotive vehicles, our product content per vehicle, and other factors that may limit or otherwise impact production by us, our supply chain and our customers. Historically, new vehicle demand and product content (i.e. vehicle features) have been driven by macro-economic and other factors, such as interest rates, automotive manufacturer and dealer sales incentives, fuel prices, consumer confidence, employment levels, income growth trends and government and tax incentives. Vehicle content has also been driven by trends in consumer preferences, such as preferences for smart devices and features, personalized user experience, and comfort, health and wellness. Economic volatility or weakness, as well as geopolitical factors, in North America, Europe or Asia, have had and could result in a significant reduction in automotive sales and production by our customers, which would have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In 2020 and 2021, and continuing into 2022, the automotive industry has experienced fluctuating demand and production disruptions related to supply chain challenges, facility closures, labor shortages, work stoppages and inflationary pressures, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated macroeconomic conditions, as described below. We believe our diversified OEM customer base and geographic revenue base, along with our flexible cost structure, have well positioned us to withstand the impact of industry downturns, including the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic conditions, and benefit from industry upturns in the ordinary course. However, shifts in the mix of global automotive production to higher cost regions or to vehicles with less of our product content as well as continuing production challenges and inflationary pressures could adversely impact our profitability. In addition, we may be adversely impacted by volatility, weakness or accelerated growth in markets for hybrid or electric vehicles specifically. We believe our products offer certain advantages for hybrid and electric vehicles, including improved energy efficiency, and position us well to withstand changes in the volume mix between vehicles driven by internal combustion engines and hybrid and other electric vehicles. We also believe that products we are developing, such as ClimateSense®, position us well to address trends in consumer preferences such as personalized user experience, comfort, health and wellness. Recent Trends General Economic Condition The COVID-19 pandemic that began around December 2019 introduced significant volatility to the global economy, disrupted supply chains and had a widespread adverse effect on the global automotive industry in the first half of 2020, with various direct and indirect adverse impacts continuing throughout 2021 and into 2022. Beginning in February 2020 and continuing into June 2020, substantially all of the Company’s major OEM and Tier 1 customers temporarily ceased or significantly reduced production as a result of restrictions that were requested or mandated by governmental authorities. As a result, substantially all of our manufacturing facilities either temporarily suspended production or experienced significant reductions in volumes during this period. By the end of the second quarter of 2020, the Company had reopened all of its manufacturing facilities, in line with industry demand, and in accordance with local government requirements. 31 Although global automotive industry production has improved relative to the first half of 2020, production remains below recent historic levels . The lingering impacts of COVID-19 into 2021 have impeded global supply chains, resulted in longer lead times and delays in procuring component parts and raw materials, and resulted in inflationary cost increases in certain raw materials, labor and transportation. These broad-based inflationary impacts have negatively impacted the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows throughout 2021. We expect these inflationary impacts to continue for the foreseeable future. Supply shortages of semiconductor chips and other components have resulted in decreases in global automotive vehicle production and significant volatility in customer vehicle production schedules. The Company's semiconductor suppliers, along with most automotive component supply companies that use semiconductors, including Gentherm, have been unable to fully meet the vehicle production demands of the OEMs due to events which are outside the Company's control, including but not limited to, the COVID-19 pandemic, the global semiconductor shortage, fires at suppliers’ facilities, significant weather events impacting semiconductor supplier facilities in the southern United States, and other extraordinary events. The Company was able to mitigate the impacts of supply chain disruptions in order to satisfy customer orders during the first three quarters of 2021, however, during the fourth quarter of 2021 and continuing into 2022 we have experienced and may continue to experience direct impacts of ongoing shortages of semiconductors. Our ability to meet customer orders without significant delay and/or expense for 2022 and beyond remains subject to significant uncertainty. In response to the global supply chain instability and inflationary cost increases the Company has taken several actions to minimize any potential and actual adverse impacts by working closely with its suppliers and customers to closely monitor the availability of semiconductor microchips and other component parts and raw materials, customer vehicle production schedules and any other supply chain inefficiencies that may arise. We expect global supply chain instability will continue to have an adverse impact on our business and financial performance for the foreseeable future, and such adverse impact may be material. The consequences of the pandemic, global supply chain instability and inflationary cost increases and their adverse impact to the global economy continue to evolve. Accordingly, the significance of the future adverse impact on our business and financial statements remains subject to significant uncertainty as of the date of this filing. Light Vehicle Production Volumes Our sales are driven by the number of vehicles produced by the automotive manufacturers, which is ultimately dependent on consumer demand for automotive vehicles, and our content per vehicle, and other factors that may limit or otherwise impact production by us, our supply chain and our customers. According to the forecasting firm IHS Markit (February 2022 release), global light vehicle production in 2021 in the Company’s key markets of North America, Europe, China, Japan and Korea, as compared to 2020, are shown below (in millions of units): 2021 2020 % Change North America 13.0 13.0 0.0 % Europe 15.9 16.6 (4.2 )% Greater China 24.8 23.6 5.1 % Japan / South Korea 10.9 11.2 (2.7 )% Total light vehicle production volume in key markets 64.6 64.4 0.3 % The IHS Markit (February 2022 release) forecasted light vehicle production volume in the Company’s key markets for full year 2022 to increase to 70.8 million units, an 9.6% increase from full year 2021 light vehicle production volumes. Forecasted light vehicle production volumes are a component of the data we use in forecasting future business. However, these forecasts generally are updated monthly, and future forecasts may be significantly different from period to period due to changes in macroeconomic conditions or matters specific to the automotive industry, such as the fluctuations that occurred since 2020 and remain ongoing due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, due to differences in regional product mix at our manufacturing facilities, as well as material production schedules from our customers for our products on specific vehicle programs, our future forecasted results do not directly correlate with the global and/or regional light vehicle production forecasts of IHS Markit or other third-party sources. New Business Awards We believe that innovation is an important element to gaining market acceptance of our products and strengthening our market position. During 2021, we secured an estimated $1,613 million of automotive new business awards, which is at the high end of the 32 range of new business awards in recent years . Automotive new business awards represent the aggregate projected lifetime revenue of new awards provided by our customers to Gentherm in the applicable period, with the value based on the price and volume projections received from each customer as of the award date. Although automotive new business awards are not firm customer orders, we believe that new business awards are an indicator of future revenue. New business awards are not projections of revenue or future business as of December 31, 202 1 , the date of this Annual Report or any other date. Customer projections regularly change over time and we do not update our calculation of any new business award after the date initially communicated. Automotive new business awards in 202 1 also do not reflect , in particular, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related macroeconomic challenges on future business. Revenues resulting from automotive new business awards also are subject to additional risks and uncertainties as described in Item 1 under “Forward-Looking Statements” of this Annual Report. Restructuring Manufacturing Footprint Rationalization In September 2019, the Company committed to a restructuring plan (“Plan”) to improve the Company’s manufacturing productivity and rationalize its footprint. Under this Plan, the Company is relocating and consolidating certain automotive electronics manufacturing plants in North America and China. During 2021, the Company completed the closures and relocation of its automotive electronics manufacturing operations from Burlington, Canada to Celaya, Mexico and from Longgang, Shenzhen, China to Bantian, Shenzhen, China. As of December 31, 2021, the electronics manufacturing in Acuña, Mexico continues to transition to Celaya, Mexico. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized restructuring expense of $1.3 million for employee separation costs and $1.7 million for other costs, primarily related to equipment move and set up costs. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized restructuring expense of $(0.8) million primarily related to a reduction in the estimates of previously recognized employee separation costs and $1.0 million for other costs, primarily related to accelerated depreciation and equipment move and set up costs. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized restructuring expense of $4.9 million for employee separation costs, and $2.1 million of other costs, primarily related to accelerated depreciation and fixed asset impairment. The Company has recorded approximately $10.1 million of restructuring expenses since the inception of this program and as of December 31, 2021, $0.9 remains accrued. Actions under the Plan are expected to be substantially completed by the first half of 2022 and future expenses are expected to be less than $1 million. Other Restructuring Activities As part of the Company’s continued efforts to optimize its cost structure, the Company has undertaken several discrete restructuring actions. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized $0.9 million, $5.4 million and $3.2 million of employee separation costs, respectively, and $0.0 million, $0.2 million and $2.8 million of other related costs, respectively. These restructuring expenses were primarily associated with restructuring actions focused on the rotation of our manufacturing footprint to best cost locations and the reduction of global overhead costs. See Note 5, “Restructuring,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for information about our restructuring activities. Divestitures Divestiture of GPT On October 1, 2019, the Company completed the sale of its remote power generation systems business, Gentherm Global Power Technologies (“GPT”) for a nominal amount and recognized a $5.9 million loss on sale for the year ended December 31, 2019, which is classified as Net loss on divestitures within the consolidated statements of income. During 2019, the Company also recognized impairment losses of $21.2 million for its GPT assets held for sale. These impairment charges are classified as Impairment loss within the consolidated statements of income. 33 Divestiture of CSZ-IC On February 1, 2019, the Company completed the sale of its environmental test equipment business, Cincinnati Sub Zero industrial chamber business (“CSZ-IC”) and former Cincinnati Sub-Zero headquarters facility for total cash proceeds of $47.5 million. The Company recognized a $4.3 million pre-tax gain on the sale of CSZ-IC for the year ended December 31, 2019 which is classified as Net loss on divestitures within the consolidated statements of income. Acquisitions Acquisition of Beckmann & Egle Industrieelektronik GmbH On July 1, 2021, the Company acquired the medical business unit of Beckmann & Egle Industrieelektronik GmbH (“B&E”), a developer and manufacturer of electronic control units, for a purchase price of $2.8 million. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination with the purchase price assigned to inventory, property and equipment and other intangible assets based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The pro-forma effect of the B&E acquisition does not materially impact the Company’s reported results for any period presented, and as a result no pro forma financial statements are presented. The results of operations of B&E are reported within the Company’s Medical segment from the date of acquisition. Acquisition of Stihler Electronic GmbH On April 1, 2019, the Company acquired Stihler Electronic GmbH (“Stihler”), a leading developer and manufacturer of patient and blood temperature management systems, for a purchase price of $15.5 million, net of cash acquired and including $0.7 million of contingent consideration that was paid upon achievement of a milestone during the year ended December 31, 2020. The results of operations of Stihler are reported within the Company’s Medical segment from the date of acquisition. Investments in non-consolidated affiliates During 2021, the Company’s Automotive segment invested $5.2 million for an ownership interest in Carrar Ltd. (“Carrar”), an Israel-based technology developer of advanced thermal management systems for the electric mobility market. The Company determined that Carrar is a VIE; however, the Company does not have a controlling financial interest or have the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of the investment. Therefore, the Company has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary. Gentherm’s investment in Carrar is measured at cost, less impairments, adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer, and is recorded in Other non-current assets. During 2021, the Company’s Automotive segment invested $2.4 million for an ownership interest in Forciot Oy (“Forciot”), a Finland-based technology developer of sensors for touch, motion and force measurement. Gentherm’s investment in Forciot is measured at cost, less impairments, adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer, and is recorded in Other non-current assets. In December 2021, the Company committed to make a $5 million investment in Autotech Fund III, L.P., pursuant to a limited partnership agreement. As a limited partner, the Company will periodically make capital contributions toward this total commitment amount over the expected ten-year life of the fund. The Company has not made any contributions to the Autotech Fund III, LP as of December 31, 2021. This fund focuses broadly on the automotive industry and compliments the Company’s innovation strategy. Reportable Segments The Company has two reportable segments for financial reporting purposes: Automotive and Medical. The financial information used by our chief operating decision maker to assess operating performance and allocate resources is based on these reportable segments. The Automotive reporting segment is comprised of the results from our global automotive businesses, including the design, development, manufacturing and sales of automotive climate comfort systems, automotive cable systems, battery performance solutions, and automotive electronic and software systems. The Medical reporting segment is comprised of the results from the patient temperature management business in the medical industry. See Note 19, “Segment Reporting,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for a description of our reportable segments as well as their proportional contribution to the Company’s reported product revenues and operating income. 34 Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 202 1 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 20 20 This section discusses our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized expenses of $4.6 million for employee separation costs and $1.2 million of other related costs. See Note 5, ""Restructuring,"" in notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information. Interest Expense Below is a summary of our Interest expense, in thousands, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020: Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 Favorable / (Unfavorable) Interest expense, net $ (2,758 ) $ (4,559 ) $ 1,801 The decrease in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to 2020 reflects the $169.5 million increased borrowings under the Credit Facility in the first quarter of 2020, primarily to provide additional liquidity and financial flexibility in response to the initial impacts from the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. A portion of these increased borrowings were repaid by the end of December 31, 2020, and the remainder was repaid in the first quarter of 2021. No amounts were drawn on the 37 Credit Facility during the year ended December 31, 2021. Amounts outstanding on the Revolving C redit F acility as of the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $35 .0 million and $ 186.2 million, respectively. See Note 9, ""Debt,"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information. Foreign Currency Gain (Loss) Below is a summary of our Foreign currency gain (loss), in thousands, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020: Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 Favorable / (Unfavorable) Foreign currency gain (loss) $ 1,487 $ (5,439 ) $ 6,926 Foreign currency gain for the year ended December 31, 2021, included net realized foreign currency loss of $1.6 million and unrealized net foreign currency gain of $3.1 million. Foreign currency loss for the year ended December 31, 2020, included net realized foreign currency gain of $2.2 million and unrealized net foreign currency loss of $7.6 million. Other Income Below is a summary of our Other income, in thousands, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020: Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 Favorable / (Unfavorable) Other income $ 117 $ 2,337 $ (2,220 ) The decrease in other income is primarily due to the 2020 non-recurring gain on sale of certain patents from a non-core business. See Note 7, “Goodwill and Other Intangibles,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information. Income Tax Expense Below is a summary of our Income tax expense, in thousands, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020: Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 Favorable / (Unfavorable) Income tax expense $ 20,418 $ 21,866 $ 1,448 Income tax expense was $20.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, on earnings before income tax of $113.9 million, representing an effective tax rate of 17.9%. The effective tax rate differed from the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to certain favorable tax effects on equity vesting, intercompany transactions during the year and the impact of income taxes on foreign earnings taxed at rates varying from the U.S. statutory rate, offset by the unfavorable impact of the global intangible low-tax income (“GILTI”), withholding taxes, other non-deductible expenses and uncertain tax positions. Income tax expense was $21.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, on earnings before income tax of $81.6 million, representing an effective tax rate of 26.8%. The tax amount included the effect of the settlement and closure of multi-year international tax audits of $3.4 million. Adjusted for the audit impacts, the effective tax rate was 22.6%. The effective tax rate differed from the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the international provisions of the U.S. tax reform, such as GILTI. 38 Liquidity and Capital Resources Overview Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flows from operations and borrowings available under our Credit Agreement. Our cash requirements consist principally of working capital, capital expenditures, research and development, operating lease payments, income tax payments and general corporate purposes. We generally reinvest available cash flows from operations into our business, while opportunistically utilizing our authorized stock repurchase program. Further, we continuously evaluate acquisition and investment opportunities that will enhance our business strategies. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had $190.6 million of cash and cash equivalents, $440 million of availability under our Credit Agreement and $26.5 million of availability under our North America receivables factoring arrangement. We also continue to maintain access to the capital markets and may issue debt or equity securities, which may provide an additional source of liquidity. We continue to expect to be able to move funds between different countries to manage our global liquidity needs without material adverse tax implications, subject to current monetary policies and the terms of the Credit Agreement. We utilize a combination of strategies, including dividends, cash pooling arrangements, intercompany loan repayments and other distributions and advances to provide the funds necessary to meet our global liquidity needs. There are no significant restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other distributions to Gentherm Incorporated. As of December 31, 2021, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries totaled approximately $161.5 million. If additional non-U.S. cash was needed for our U.S. operations, we may be required to accrue and pay withholding if we were to distribute such funds from non-U.S. subsidiaries to the U.S.; however, based on our current liquidity needs and strategies, we do not anticipate a need to accrue and pay such additional amounts. We currently believe that our cash and cash equivalents and borrowings available under our Credit Agreement and the North America receivables factoring arrangement will be adequate to meet anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months and the foreseeable future. Cash and Cash Flows The table below summarizes our cash activity for each of the last two fiscal years (in thousands): Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of period $ 268,345 $ 52,948 Net cash provided by operating activities 143,076 110,695 Net cash used in investing activities (48,830 ) (18,220 ) Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (169,141 ) 115,480 Foreign currency effect on cash and cash equivalents (2,844 ) 7,442 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period $ 190,606 $ 268,345 Cash Flows From Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities totaled $143.1 million and $110.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Cash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 consisted primarily of net income of $93.4 million, increased by $54.3 million for non-cash charges for depreciation, amortization, non-cash stock based compensation, and loss on disposition of property and equipment, partially offset by non-cash charges of $0.5 million for deferred income taxes and other, and $4.2 million related to changes in assets and liabilities. Cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 consisted primarily of net income of $59.7 million, increased by $51.5 million for non-cash charges for depreciation, amortization, non-cash stock based compensation, deferred income taxes and loss on disposition of property and equipment, and $2.3 million related to changes in operating assets and liabilities, partially offset by $2.7 million net gain on sale of property and equipment and other. 39 Cash Flows From Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities totaled $48.8 million and $18.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in usage is primarily attributable to increased capital expenditures of $21.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2021, usage included $10.4 million paid for business acquisitions and technology investments. During the year ended December 31, 2020, usage included $3.1 million paid for acquisition of intangible assets, partially offset by $2.1 million proceeds for the sale of patents, property and equipment. Cash Flows From Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities totaled $169.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and net cash provided by financing activities totaled $115.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Cash flows used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily included $153.2 million of debt repayments, $20.0 million paid to repurchase common stock and $4.1 million paid for employee taxes related to the net settlement of restricted stock units that vested during the year, partially offset by $8.3 million of proceeds from the exercise of common stock options. Cash flows provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily included proceeds of $201.1 million received from the increased borrowings under our Credit Agreement, $16.6 million of proceeds from the exercise of common stock options, partially offset by $91.4 million of debt repayments, $9.1 million paid to repurchase common stock and $1.1 million paid for employee taxes related to the net settlement of restricted stock units that vested during the year. Debt The following table summarizes the Company’s debt at December 31, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in thousands). December 31, 2021 2020 Interest Rate Principal Balance Interest Rate Principal Balance Amended Credit Agreement: U.S. Revolving Note (U.S. Dollar denominations) 1.35 % $ 35,000 1.65 % $ 171,500 U.S. Revolving Note (Euro denominations) — — 1.50 % 14,684 DEG Vietnam Loan 5.21 % 3,750 5.21 % 6,250 Total debt 38,750 192,434 Current maturities (2,500 ) (2,500 ) Long-term debt, less current maturities $ 36,250 $ 189,934 Credit Agreement Gentherm, together with certain of its subsidiaries, maintain a revolving credit note (“U.S. Revolving Note”) under its Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a consortium of lenders and Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent. The Credit Agreement has a maximum borrowing capacity of $475 million and matures on June 27, 2024. The Credit Agreement contains covenants, that, among other things, (i) prohibit or limit the ability of the borrowers and any material subsidiary to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, pay dividends, make certain types of investments (including acquisitions), enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates, prepay other indebtedness, sell assets, merge with other companies or enter into certain other transactions outside the ordinary course of business, and (ii) require that Gentherm maintain a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio and Consolidated Leverage Ratio (based on consolidated EBITDA for the applicable trailing 12-month period as defined in the Credit Agreement) as of the end of any fiscal quarter. DEG Vietnam Loan The Company also has a fixed interest rate loan with the German Investment Corporation (“DEG”), a subsidiary of KfW Banking Group, a Germany government-owned development bank. The fixed interest rate senior loan agreement with DEG was used to finance the construction and set up of the Vietnam production facility (“DEG Vietnam Loan”). The DEG Vietnam Loan is subject to semi-annual principal payments that began November, 2017 and will end May, 2023. 40 See Note 9, “Debt,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information. Other Sources of Liquidity In June, 2021, we entered into a receivable factoring agreement with HSBC Bank USA, National Association. Under the receivable factoring agreement, we can sell receivables for certain of our North America account debtors up to $41.3 million, on a revolving basis, subject to outstanding balances and concentration limits. As of December 31, 2021, there were no outstanding receivables transferred under the receivable factoring agreement and our availability under the receivables factoring agreement was $26.5 million. Material Cash Requirements The following table summarizes current and long-term material cash requirements as of December 31, 2021, which we expect to fund primarily with operating cash flows. Payments Due by Period Material Cash Requirements (in thousands) Total Less than 1 year 1 to 3 years 3 to 5 years More than 5 years Long-term debt obligations (1) $ 38,750 $ 2,500 $ 36,250 $ — $ — Operating lease obligations (2) 29,671 6,541 8,864 6,728 7,538 Purchase obligations (3) 24,457 19,832 4,625 — — Capital commitments (4) 5,388 5,388 — — — Other 250 50 100 100 — Total $ 98,516 $ 34,311 $ 49,839 $ 6,828 $ 7,538 (1) Long-term debt obligations do not include an amount payable for interest. See Note 9, “Debt,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information. (2) See Note 8, “Leases,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information. (3) Purchase obligations are comprised of commitments to secure the supply of certain semiconductor chips. We have entered into agreements with various suppliers to reserve the rights to certain semiconductor chips over the next 12 to 24 months, with volume commitments determined based on our anticipated production requirements. Such agreements provide the Company with priority access to semiconductor chips as they become available, however, these agreements do not guarantee that our suppliers will meet the timing and quantities requested by Gentherm. We have not included amounts for other material and component purchase obligations related to standard recurring purchases of materials for use in our manufacturing operations as these amounts are generally consistent from year to year, closely reflect our levels of production, and are not long-term in nature. (4) Capital commitments is comprised of commitments for capital expenditures. Such commitments are typically less than one year. Other Commitments In December 2021, the Company committed to make a $5 million investment in Autotech Fund III, L.P., pursuant to a limited partnership agreement. As a limited partner, the Company will periodically make capital contributions toward this total commitment amount over the expected ten year life of the fund. The Company has not made any contributions to the Autotech Fund III, LP as of December 31, 2021. Timing of the capital contributions is unknown and therefore amounts have been excluded from the Material Cash Requirements table above. Capital Expenditures We anticipate capital expenditures in fiscal year 2022 of approximately $50 million to $60 million. We will continue support organic growth through capacity expansion in our facilities and make capital improvements as necessary. We believe cash on hand, cash generated from operations, and the borrowing capacity available under our Credit Agreement will be sufficient to support our capital expenditures. 41 Stock Repurchase Program On December 11, 2020, the Board of Directors authorized the 2020 Stock Repurchase Program, pursuant to which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $150 million of its issued and outstanding common stock over a three-year period, expiring December 15, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company repurchased approximately $20 million of shares under the 2020 Stock Repurchase Program with an average price paid per share of $83.44. The 2020 Stock Repurchase Program has $130 million of repurchase authorization remaining as of December 31, 2021. Repurchases may be made, from time to time, in amounts and at prices the Company deems appropriate, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, debt covenants and other considerations. Any such repurchases may be executed using open market purchases, privately negotiated agreements or other transactions. Repurchases may be funded from cash on hand, available borrowings or proceeds from potential debt or other capital markets sources. For further information related to our stock repurchase program, see Note 15, ""Equity"" in notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. Effects of Inflation The automotive component supply industry has historically been subject to inflationary pressures with respect to materials and labor. In 2021 and continuing in 2022, macroeconomic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in inflationary cost increases in certain materials, labor and transportation. These inflationary cost increases are expected to continue into the foreseeable future as demand remains elevated and supply remains constrained. Although the Company has developed and implemented strategies to mitigate the impact of higher material component costs and transportation costs, these strategies, together with commercial negotiations with Gentherm's customers and suppliers may not fully offset our future cost increases. Such inflationary cost increase may increase the cash required to fund our operations by a material amount. Critical Accounting Estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). In preparing these consolidated financial statements, management was required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are based on our historical experience, the terms of existing contracts, our evaluation of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers and suppliers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. These estimates and assumptions are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates, and such differences could be material to our financial statements. We have identified the following estimates as our most critical accounting estimates, which are those that are most important to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the Company’s financial condition and results of operations, and that require management’s most subjective and complex judgments. Information regarding our other significant accounting estimates and policies are disclosed in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements. Impairments of Goodwill Critical estimates: Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually as of December 31 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In conducting our annual impairment assessment testing, we first perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. If not, no further goodwill impairment testing is performed. If it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, or if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit, we then compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the related net book value. If the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. 42 The Company utilizes an income approach to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit and a market valuation approach to further support this analysis. The income approach is based on projected debt-free cash flow that is discounted to the present value using discount factors that consider the timing and risk of cash flows. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based on the reporting unit’s expected long-term operating cash flow performance. This approach also mitigates the impact of cyclical trends that occur in our industry. Fair value is estimated using internally developed forecasts, as well as commercial and discount rate assumptions. The discount rate used is the value-weighted average of our estimated cost of equity and of debt (“cost of capital”) derived using both known and estimated customary market metrics. Our weighted average cost of capital is adjusted to reflect a risk factor, if necessary. Other significant assumptions include terminal value growth rates and terminal value margin rates. To further support the fair value estimate determined by the income approach, the Company utilizes a market valuation approach to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. The market approach considers historical and/or anticipated financial metrics of a reporting unit and applies valuation multiples based on recent observed transactions involving companies similar enough to the r eporting u nits from which to draw meaningful conclusions . Judgments and uncertainties: These fair value calculations contain uncertainties as they require management to make assumptions about future cash flows and appropriate discount rates to reflect the risk inherent in the future cash flows and to derive a reasonable enterprise value and related premium. Our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies. The estimated future cash flows reflect management's latest assumptions of the financial projections based on current and anticipated competitive landscape, including estimates of revenue based on production volumes over the foreseeable future and long-term growth rates, and operating margins based on historical trends and future cost containment activities. Also, the market valuation approach is highly subjective as it requires the selection of comparable companies and valuation multiples. Impact if actual results differ from assumptions: As of December 31, 2021, our goodwill balance included $37.3 million related to our Automotive segment and $28.7 million related to our Medical segment. These balances could be fully or partially impaired if management does not achieve the expected cash flows assumed in the fair value estimates or if assumptions and cash flow estimates change in future periods. Income Taxes Critical estimates: The Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous international jurisdictions. In calculating our effective income tax rate, we make judgments regarding certain tax positions, including the timing and amount of deductions and allocations of income among various tax jurisdictions. When determining whether we will be able to realize deferred tax assets, judgment is used to evaluate the positive and negative evidence, including forecasting taxable income using historical and future operating results. The provision for income taxes includes current income taxes as well as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on the difference between the financial statement and tax base of assets and liabilities at the applicable enacted tax rates. Judgments and uncertainties: We have various tax filing positions with regard to the timing and amount of deductions and credits and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions, based on our interpretation of local tax laws, supported by external advisor review for material positions. Valuation allowances are established when necessary on a jurisdictional basis to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized when management considers it more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The determination as to whether a deferred tax asset will be realized is based on the evaluation of positive and negative evidence, which includes historical profitability, future market growth, future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and tax planning strategies. The Company assesses deferred taxes and the adequacy or need for a valuation allowance on a quarterly basis. 43 The Company is subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions. At any time, multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities and a number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which a liability has been established, is audited and fully resolved or clarified. In evaluating the exposures associated with various tax filing positions, the Company may record liabilities for such exposures. The Company generally adjusts its liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits and related indemnification obligations through earnings in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position, or when more information becomes available. Although management believes that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and may materially increase or decrease the effective tax rate, as well as impact the Company’s operating results . Impact if actual results differ from assumptions: Some or all of management’s judgments are subject to review by the taxing authorities. If one or more of the taxing authorities were to successfully challenge our right to realize some or all of the tax benefit we have recorded, and we were unable to realize this benefit, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows. Further, if the Company is unable to generate sufficient future taxable income, there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates, a change to the time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible, or if the tax laws change unfavorably, then the Company could be required to increase the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets, resulting in an increase in income tax expense and the effective tax rate. For the year ended December 31, 2021, each change of the effective tax rate by one percentage point would impact income tax expense by $1.1 million. Recent Accounting Pronouncements For a complete description of recent accounting standards which we have not yet been required to implement which may be applicable to our operations, as well as significant accounting standards that have been adopted during the year ended December 31, 2021, see Note 3, “New Accounting Pronouncements,” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report. I TEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations and foreign currency contracts. We have in the past, and may in the future, place our investments in bank certificates of deposits, debt instruments of the U. S. government, and in high-quality corporate issuers. We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, short-term interest rates and price fluctuations of certain material commodities such as copper. Market risks for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our debt obligations under our Credit Agreement. Foreign currency exchange risks are attributable to sales to foreign customers and purchases from foreign suppliers not denominated in a location’s functional currency, foreign plant operations, intercompany indebtedness, intercompany investments and include exposures to the Euro, Mexican Peso, Canadian Dollar, Hungarian Forint, North Macedonian Denar, Ukrainian Hryvnia, Japanese Yen, Chinese Renminbi, Korean Won and Vietnamese Dong. The Company regularly enters into derivative contracts with the objective of managing its financial and operational exposure arising from these risks by offsetting gains and losses on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the financial instruments used to hedge them. The maximum length of time over which the Company hedges its exposure to foreign currency exchange risks and price fluctuations in material commodities is fifteen months. We had foreign currency derivative contracts with a notional value of $14.0 million and $13.3 million outstanding at December 31, 2021 and 2020 and copper commodity swap contracts with a notional value of $0.3 million and $0 million outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The potential loss in fair value for foreign currency derivative contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted currency exchange rates would be approximately $1.3 million and $1.3 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The potential gain in fair value from a hypothetical 10% change in quoted currency exchange rates would be approximately $1.6 million and $1.6 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The impact of a 10% change in rates on fair value differs from a 10% change in the net fair value asset due to the existence of hedges. The model assumes a parallel shift in currency exchange rates; however, currency exchange rates rarely move in the same direction. The assumption that currency exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing currency exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. 44 The potential loss in fair value for copper commodity swap contracts from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted copper commodity prices would be $0.1 million a nd $0 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The potential gain in fair value from a hypothetical 10% positive change in quoted copper commodity prices would be $0.1 million an d $0 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Our hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedge, and hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions both at the inception of a hedge and on an ongoing basis to be designated for hedge accounting treatment. For derivative contracts which can be classified as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is recorded to Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheet. When the underlying hedge transaction is realized, the gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive loss is recorded in earnings in the consolidated statements of income on the same line as the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. We record the ineffective portion of foreign currency and copper commodity hedging instruments, if any, to cost of sales in the consolidated statements of income. Though we continuously monitor the hedging program, derivative positions and hedging strategies, foreign currency forward exchange agreements have not always been designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. The Company uses an income approach to value derivative instruments, analyzing quoted market prices to calculate the forward values and then discounts such forward values to the present value using benchmark rates at commonly quoted intervals for the instrument’s full term.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Management of the Company, under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2021. As defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (as amended, the “Exchange Act”), disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2021. Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f), for the Company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 based on the framework set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).” Based on that evaluation, management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021. The attestation report of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, regarding the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, is set forth in Item 15, ""Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules,"" included under the caption ""Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"". Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2021, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 17, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical audit matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated fi nancial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates. Valuation of Goodwill – Medical Description of the Matter As of December 31, 2021, the Company’s goodwill related to the medical reporting unit (segment) was $28.7 million. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually as of December 31 and w henever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than it’s carrying amount. Auditing management’s annual goodwill impairment assessment for the medical reporting unit was complex and highly judgmental due to the significant estimation required to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. In particular, the fair value estimates used in the valuation of the medical reporting unit were sensitive to significant assumptions, such as changes in the discount rate, revenue growth rates, including the terminal growth rate and operating margins, which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions. How We Addressed the Matter in our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s annual goodwill assessment, and annual forecasting process whereby the Company develops significant assumptions that are used in its analyses. This included controls over management's review of the valuation model and the significant assumptions used in the fair value measurements discussed above. To test the estimated fair value of the Company’s medical reporting unit, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the methodologies used and directly testing the significant assumptions and the underlying data used by the Company in its analysis, including assessing the completeness and accuracy of such underlying data. We utilized internal valuation specialists to assist in the evaluation of the assumptions and other relevant information that are most significant to the fair value estimate of the reporting unit, such as assessing the fair value methodologies applied and evaluating the reasonableness of the discount rate selected by management. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends, historical performance, guideline public companies in the same industry and strategic plans. We performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the reporting unit that would result from changes in the assumptions. Furthermore, we assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. F-2 /s/ ERNST & YOUNG LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2020. Detroit, Michigan February 17, 2022 F-3 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Gentherm Incorporated Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Gentherm Incorporated’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Gentherm Incorporated (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 and our report dated February 17, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ ERNST & YOUNG LLP Detroit, Michigan February 17, 2022 F-4 REPO RT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Board of Directors and Shareholders Gentherm Incorporated Opinion on the financial statements We have audited the consolidated balance sheet of Gentherm Incorporated (a Michigan corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2019 (not presented herein), and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for the year then ended, and the related notes and financial statement schedule included under Item 15 (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”).

Impact of COVID-19, Supply Chain Disruptions and Other Matters The COVID-19 pandemic that began around December 2019 introduced significant volatility to the global economy, disrupted supply chains and had a widespread adverse effect on the global automotive industry in the first half of 2020, with various direct and indirect adverse impacts continuing throughout 2021. Beginning in February 2020 and continuing into June 2020, substantially all of the Company’s major OEM and Tier 1 customers temporarily ceased or significantly reduced production as a result of restrictions that were requested or mandated by governmental authorities. As a result, substantially all of our manufacturing facilities either temporarily suspended production or experienced significant reductions in volumes during this period. By the end of the second quarter of 2020, the Company had reopened all of its manufacturing facilities, in line with industry demand, and in accordance with local government requirements. Although global automotive industry production has improved relative to the first half of 2020, production remains below recent historic levels. The lingering impacts of COVID-19 into 2021 has impeded global supply chains, resulted in longer lead times and delays in procuring component parts and raw materials, and resulted in inflationary cost increases in certain raw materials, labor and transportation. These broad-based inflationary impacts have negatively impacted the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021. Supply shortages of semiconductor chips and other components have resulted in decreases in global automotive vehicle production and significant volatility in customer vehicle production schedules. The Company's semiconductor suppliers, along with most automotive component supply companies that use semiconductors, including Gentherm, have been unable to fully meet the vehicle production demands of the OEMs due to events which are outside the Company's control, including but not limited to, the COVID-19 pandemic, the global semiconductor shortage, fires at suppliers’ facilities, significant weather events impacting semiconductor supplier facilities in the southern United States, and other extraordinary events. In response to the global supply chain instability and inflationary cost increases the Company has taken several actions to minimize any potential and actual adverse impacts by working with its suppliers and customers to closely monitor the availability of semiconductor microchips and other component parts and raw materials, customer vehicle production schedules and any other supply chain inefficiencies that may arise. The consequences of the pandemic and adverse impact to the global economy continue to evolve. Accordingly, the future adverse impact on our business and financial statements remains subject to significant uncertainty as of the date of this filing. F-11 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). On February 1, 2019, the Company completed the divestiture of its environmental test equipment business, Cincinnati Sub Zero industrial chamber business (“CSZ-IC”) and on October 1, 2019, the Company completed the divestiture of its remote power generation systems business, Gentherm Global Power Technologies (“GPT”). The Company’s consolidated financial statements herein include the results of CSZ-IC and GPT through their respective dates of divestiture, and are included in the Medical segment. CSZ-IC and GPT are not subject to discontinued operations classification. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly owned subsidiaries and those entities in which it has a controlling financial interest. The Company evaluates its relationship with other entities for consolidation and to identify whether such entities are variable interest entities (“VIE”) and to assess whether the Company is the primary beneficiary of such entities. Investments in affiliates in which Gentherm does not have control but does have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are accounted for under the equity method. When Gentherm does not have the ability to exercise significant influence (generally when ownership interest is less than 20 %), investments in affiliates are measured at cost, less impairments, adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer . Intercompany transactions and balances between consolidated businesses have been eliminated. Use of Estimates In preparing these consolidated financial statements, management was required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are based on our historical experience, the terms of existing contracts, our evaluation of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers and suppliers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. These estimates and assumptions are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. We are not presently aware of any events or circumstances that would require us to update such estimates and assumptions or revise the carrying value of our assets or liabilities. Our estimates may change, however, as new events occur and additional information is obtained. As a result, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates, and any such differences may be material to our financial statements. Segment Reporting The Company has two reportable segments: Automotive and Medical . The Automotive reporting segment is comprised of the results from our global automotive businesses, including the design, development, manufacturing and sales of automotive climate comfort systems, automotive cable systems, battery performance solutions, and automotive electronic and software systems. The Medical reporting segment is comprised of the results from the patient temperature management business in the medical industry. Patient temperature management includes temperature management systems across multiple product categories addressing the needs of hyper-hypothermia therapy in intensive care, normothermia in surgical procedures and additional warming/cooling therapies utilized in acute care, ambulatory, clinics and home health. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized from agreements containing enforceable rights and obligations, when promised goods are delivered or services are completed. Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue- F-12 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) producing transaction, that are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from P roduct revenue s . Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are included in P roduct revenues , while costs of shipping and handling are included in C ost of sale s . Automotive Revenues The Company provides production parts to its customers under long-term supply agreements (“LTAs”). The duration of an LTA is generally consistent with the life cycle of a vehicle; however, an LTA does not reach the level of a performance obligation until Gentherm receives either a purchase order and/or a materials release from its customer for a specific number of production parts at a specified price, at which point an enforceable contract exists. Revenue is recognized when control of the production parts has transferred to the customer according to the terms of the contract, which typically occurs when the parts are shipped or delivered to the customer’s premises. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring production parts. Certain LTAs provide for annual price reductions over the production life of the vehicle. Agreements that are determined to provide customers with purchase option discounts that would not be received without entering into the contract are considered to contain a material right (for example, a discount given to a customer that is incremental to the range of discounts typically given to that class of customer). The material right represents a purchase option that provides the customer with the ability to purchase additional production parts at a set price in the future and is accounted for as a separate performance obligation. Under these circumstances, each transfer of production parts under the LTA requires allocation of the purchase price to the production part and the purchase option. As a practical alternative to estimating the standalone selling price of an option, the Company allocates transaction price to the purchase option by reference to the production part volumes expected to be ordered and the consideration expected to be received over the life of the vehicle program. The production part’s relative standalone selling price observed under the LTA is subtracted from the total amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring of parts under the current contract and the difference is allocated to the purchase option. Revenue from options containing a material right is recognized when the amounts billed to the customer for production parts transferred, under the LTA, is less than the standalone selling price of those production parts. Medical Revenues Revenues from our patient temperature management business unit are generated from the sale of products and equipment. Our medical products and equipment focus on body and blood temperature management. The Company sells medical products and equipment primarily through distributor and group purchasing organization agreements. These agreements allow member participants to the distributor or group purchasing organization to make purchases at discounted prices negotiated by the distributor or group purchasing organization. A rebate is incurred at the point in time a member participant purchases product covered under these types of agreements. Rebates are accounted for as variable consideration, using an expected value, probability weighted approach, based on the level of sales to the distributor and the time lag between the initial sale and the rebate claim in determining the transaction price of a contract. Revenue is recognized at the point in time the medical products or equipment is transferred to the customer. Assets Recognized from the Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer The Company has no material contract assets or contract liabilities as of December 31, 2021. The Company recognizes an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if the benefits of those costs are expected to be realized for a period greater than one year . Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were $ 1,946 and $ 1,805 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These amounts are recorded in Other non-current assets and are being amortized into Product revenues over the expected production life of the applicable program. During the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, $ 174 and $ 263 , respectively, was amortized into Product revenues. F-13 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of less than 90 days to be cash equivalents. Cash balances in individual banks may exceed the federally insured limit by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Company had Cash and cash equivalents of $ 161,496 and $ 106,598 held in foreign jurisdictions as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Restricted cash includes cash that is legally restricted as to use or withdrawal. Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of financial instruments comprising cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, notes receivable and accounts payable approximate fair value because of the short maturities of these instruments. The carrying amount of the Company’s revolving credit note under the June 27, 2019 amended and restated credit agreement (“Credit Agreement”) approximates its fair value because interest charged on the loan balance is variable. See Note 14, “Fair Value Measurement,” for information about the techniques used to assess the fair value of financial assets and liabilities, including our fixed rate debt instruments. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial assets, which subject the Company to concentration of credit risk, consist primarily of cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable and notes receivable. Cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds managed by major financial services companies. The credit risk for these cash equivalents is considered low. The Company does not require collateral from its customers. As of December 31, 2021, the Company’s Automotive customers, Adient and Lear both individually represented 22 % and 18 %, respectively, of the Company’s accounts receivable balance. As of December 31, 2020, Adient and Lear both individually represented 18 % of the Company’s accounts receivable balance. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are stated at the invoiced amount, less allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated amounts not expected to be collected, and do not bear interest. The Company determines the allowances based on historical write-off experience by industry and regional economic data, current expectations of future credit losses and historical cash discounts. The Company’s accounts receivables are continually assessed for collectability and any allowance is recorded based upon the age of outstanding receivables, historical payment experience and customer creditworthiness. We write-off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $ 1,399 and $ 1,161 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Primarily in the Asia-Pacific region, the Company receives bank notes from certain customers to settle trade receivables. The collection of such bank notes is included in operating cash flows based on the substance of the underlying transactions, which are operating in nature. Bank notes held by the Company are classified as notes receivable within other current assets. The Company may hold such bank notes until maturity, exchange them with suppliers to settle liabilities, or sell them to third-party financial institutions in exchange for cash. Inventory The Company’s inventory is measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Raw materials, components and consumables are measured using the weighted average cost method. Work-in-process and finished goods are measured using the first-in first-out method. If the net realizable value expected on the reporting date is below cost, a write-down is recorded to adjust inventory to its net realizable value. We recognize a reserve for obsolete and slow-moving inventories based on estimates of future sales and an inventory item’s capacity to be repurposed for a different use. We consider the number of months supply on hand based on current planned requirements, uncommitted future projections and historical usage in estimating the inventory reserve. F-14 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Property and Equipment Property and equipment, including additions and improvements, are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for general repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. When property or equipment is retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts. Gains or losses from retirements and disposals are recorded as Operating income or expense. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives of the Company’s Property and equipment are as follows: Asset Category Useful Life Buildings and improvements 1 to 30 years Plant and equipment 10 years Production tooling 2 to 10 years Leasehold improvements Term of lease Information technology 1 to 5 years The Company recognized depreciation expense of $ 29,622 , $ 31,037 and $ 33,639 for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Tooling The Company incurs costs related to tooling used in the manufacture of products sold to its customers. In some cases, the Company enters into contracts with its customers whereby the Company incurs the costs to design, develop and purchase tooling and is then reimbursed by the customer under a reimbursement contract. Tooling costs that will be reimbursed by customers are included in Other current assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at the lower of accumulated cost or the customer reimbursable amount. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had $ 3,778 and $ 4,831 , respectively, of reimbursable tooling costs capitalized. Company-owned tooling is included in Property and equipment and depreciated over its expected useful life, generally two to ten years . Management periodically evaluates the recoverability of tooling costs, based on estimated future cash flows, and makes provisions, where appropriate, for tooling costs that will not be recovered. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in conjunction with business combinations are based on the Company’s estimate of fair value, as of the date of acquisition. Amortization of other intangible assets is computed using the straight-line method. The fair value and corresponding useful lives for acquired intangible assets are listed below as follows: Asset Category Useful Life Customer relationships 8 to 15 years Technology 5 to 10 years Product development costs 5 to 10 years Trade names Indefinite Our business strategy largely centers on designing products based upon internally developed and purchased technology, and we protect certain technology with patents that have value to our business strategy. Our policy is to expense all costs associated with the F-15 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) development and issuance of new patents as incurred. Such costs are classified as research and development expenses in the accompanying consolidat ed statements of income . Impairments of Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually as of December 31 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In conducting our annual impairment assessment testing, we first perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. If not, no further goodwill impairment testing is performed. If it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, or if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit, we then compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the related net book value. If the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. The Company utilizes an income approach to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit and a market valuation approach to further support this analysis (level 3). The income approach is based on projected debt-free cash flow that is discounted to the present value using discount factors that consider the timing and risk of cash flows. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based on the reporting unit’s expected long-term operating cash flow performance. This approach also mitigates the impact of cyclical trends that occur in our industry. Fair value is estimated using internally developed forecasts, as well as commercial and discount rate assumptions. The discount rate used is the value-weighted average of our estimated cost of equity and of debt (“cost of capital”) derived using both known and estimated customary market metrics. Our weighted average cost of capital is adjusted to reflect a risk factor, if necessary. Other significant assumptions include terminal value growth rates and terminal value margin rates. While there are inherent uncertainties related to the assumptions used and to management’s application of these assumptions to this analysis, we believe that the income approach provides a reasonable estimate of the fair value of a reporting unit. The Company performs its indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment annually as of December 31, and between annual assessments if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount . Investments in non-consolidated affiliates During 2021, the Company’s Automotive segment invested $ 5,200 for an ownership interest in Carrar Ltd. (“Carrar”), an Israel-based technology developer of advanced thermal management systems for the electric mobility market. The Company determined that Carrar is a VIE; however, the Company does not have a controlling financial interest or have the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the economic performance of the investment. Therefore, the Company has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary. Gentherm’s investment in Carrar is measured at cost, less impairments, adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer, and is recorded in Other non-current assets. During 2021, the Company’s Automotive segment invested $ 2,357 for an ownership interest in Forciot Oy (“Forciot”), a technology developer of sensors for touch, motion and force measurement. Gentherm’s investment in Forciot is measured at cost, less impairments, adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer, and is recorded in Other non-current assets. In December 2021, the Company committed to make a $ 5,000 investment in Autotech Fund III, L.P., pursuant to a limited partnership agreement. As a limited partner, the Company will periodically make capital contributions toward this total commitment amount over the expected ten year life of the fund. The Company has not made any contributions to the Autotech Fund III, LP as of December 31, 2021. This fund focuses broadly on the automotive industry and compliments the Company’s innovation strategy. Research and Development Expenses Research and development activities are expensed as incurred. The Company groups development and prototype costs and related reimbursements in research and development. F-16 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Leases The Company has operating leases for office, manufacturing and research and development facilities, as well as land leases for certain manufacturing facilities that are accounted for as operating leases. We also have operating leases for office equipment and automobiles. Excluding land leases, our leases have remaining lease terms ranging from less than 1 year to 10 years and may include options to extend the lease. Land leases have remaining lease terms that range from 39 to 41 years and some which specify that the end of the lease term is at the discretion of the lessee. We do not have lease arrangements with related parties. The Company determines whether a contractual arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Leases that are operating in nature are recognized in Operating lease right-of-use assets, Current lease liabilities and Non-current lease liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Gentherm is not currently party to any leases that qualify as financing leases. Lease liabilities are measured initially at the present value of the sum of the future minimum rental payments at the commencement date of the lease. Lease payments that will vary in the future due to changes in facts and circumstances are excluded from the calculation of rental payments, unless those variable payments are based on an index or rate. Rental payments are discounted using an incremental borrowing rate, unless there is a rate implicit in the lease agreement. The incremental borrowing rate is based on the Company’s credit rating, determined on a fully collateralized loan basis from information available at commencement date, and the duration of the lease term (the “reference rate”). Judgement is used to assess the importance of risk factor inputs during the computation of the Company’s credit rating. For leases at foreign subsidiaries denominated in U.S. Dollars, a risk premium associated with the borrower subsidiary’s country is added to the reference rate. For significant leases at foreign subsidiaries denominated in a foreign currency, the U.S. Dollar risk free rate with a duration similar to that of the lease term is subtracted from the reference rate and a corresponding foreign currency risk free rate with a duration similar to that of the lease term is added to the reference rate. Operating lease right-of-use assets are measured at the amount of the lease liability, adjusted for prepaid or accrued lease payments, lease incentive received, and initial direct costs incurred, as applicable. Periods covered by an option to extend the lease are initially included in the measurement of an operating lease right-of-use asset and lease liability only when it is reasonably certain we will exercise the option. Gentherm’s lease agreements do not contain residual value guarantees or impose restrictions or covenants on the Company. For all classes of underlying assets, the Company accounts for leases that contain separate lease and non-lease components as containing a single lease component. The Company does not recognize lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities from leases with an original lease term of 12 months or less and, instead, recognizes rent payments on a straight-line basis over the lease term in the consolidated statements of income. Income Taxes The Company records income tax expense using the liability method which specifies that deferred tax assets and liabilities be measured each year based on the difference between the financial statement and tax base of assets and liabilities at the applicable enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when management considers it more likely than not that the asset will not be realized. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, a valuation allowance has been provided for certain deferred tax assets which the Company has concluded are more likely than not to not be realized. If future annual taxable income were to be significantly less than current and projected levels, there is a risk that certain of our deferred tax assets not already provided for by the valuation allowance would expire prior to utilization. F-17 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) The Company recognize s the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in I ncome tax expense. Derivative Financial Instruments – Hedge Accounting The Company accounts for its derivative financial instruments as cash flow hedges. For derivative contracts which are designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative contract is recorded to Accumulated other comprehensive loss (“AOCI”) in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. When the underlying hedge transaction is realized, the gain or loss included in AOCI is recorded into earnings in the accompanying consolidated statements of income on the same line as the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. Any ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of income under Foreign currency gain (loss) for foreign currency derivatives, and cost of goods sold for commodity derivatives. These hedging transactions and the respective correlations meet the requirements for hedge accounting. Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the respective period. The Company’s diluted earnings per share give effect to all potential shares of common stock outstanding during a period that do not have an anti-dilutive impact to the calculation. In computing the number of diluted shares outstanding, the treasury stock method is used in order to arrive at a net number of shares created upon the conversion of common stock equivalents. Stock Based Compensation Share based payments that involve the issuance of common stock to employees, including grants of employee stock options, restricted stock, and time-based and performance-based restricted stock units, are recognized in the consolidated financial statements as compensation expense based upon the fair value on the date of grant. Share based payments that are satisfied only by the payment of cash, such as stock appreciation rights, are accounted for as liabilities. The liability is reported at market value of the vested portion of the underlying units. During each period, the change in the liability is recorded as compensation expense. Note 3 — New Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Income Taxes In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, ""Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes"". This ASU simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions previously included in the guidance. In addition, the ASU amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. The Company adopted ASU 2019-12 as of January 1, 2021 and there was no significant impact on its financial statements and related disclosures as a result . F-18 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Reference Rate Reform In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting”. ASU 2020-04 provides practical expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The expedients and exceptions provided by the amendments in this update apply only to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued as a result of reference rate reform. These amendments are not applicable to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2022. In January 2021, the FASB subsequently issued ASU 2021-01, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope” to clarify that certain optional expedients and exceptions in Topic 848 for contract modifications and hedge accounting apply to derivatives that are affected by the discounting transition. ASU 2020-04 and ASU 2021-01 are effective as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022 and may be applied retrospectively to contract modifications and hedging relationships from the beginning of an interim period that includes or is subsequent to March 12, 2020, or on a prospective basis to new modifications from any date within an interim period that includes or is subsequent to the date of the issuance of a final update, up to the date that financial statements are available to be issued. Upon adoption of this standard, the Company does not expect it to have a material impact to the Company’s financial statements. Note 4 – Acquisitions and Divestitures Acquisition of Beckmann & Egle Industrieelektronik GmbH On July 1, 2021, the Company acquired the medical business unit of Beckmann & Egle Industrieelektronik GmbH (“B&E”), a developer and manufacturer of electronic control units, for a purchase price of $ 2,827 . The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination with the purchase price assigned to inventory, property and equipment and other intangible assets based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. The pro forma effect of the B&E acquisition does not materially impact the Company’s reported results for any period presented, and as a result no pro forma financial statements are presented. The results of operations of B&E are reported within the Company’s Medical segment from the date of acquisition. Divestiture of GPT On October 1, 2019, the Company completed the sale of GPT for a nominal amount and recognized a $ 5,885 loss on sale for the year ended December 31, 2019, which is classified as Net loss on divestitures within the consolidated statements of income. During 2019, the Company also recognized impairment losses of $ 21,206 for its GPT assets held for sale. These impairment charges are classified as Impairment loss within the consolidated statements of income. Acquisition of Stihler Electronic GmbH On April 1, 2019, the Company acquired Stihler Electronic GmbH (“Stihler”), a leading developer and manufacturer of patient and blood temperature management systems, for a purchase price of $ 15,476 , net of cash acquired and including $ 653 of contingent consideration that was paid upon achievement of a milestone during the year ended December 31, 2020. The results of operations of Stihler are reported within the Company’s Medical segment from the date of acquisition. Divestiture of CSZ-IC On February 1, 2019, the Company completed the sale of its environmental test equipment business, CSZ-IC and former Cincinnati Sub-Zero headquarters facility for total cash proceeds of $ 47,500 . The Company recognized a $ 4,298 pre-tax gain on the sale of CSZ-IC for the year ended December 31, 2019 which is classified as Net loss on divestitures within the consolidated statements of income. F-19 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Note 5 — Restructuring Manufacturing Footprint Rationalization In September 2019, the Company committed to a restructuring plan (“Plan”) to improve the Company’s manufacturing productivity and rationalize its footprint. Under this Plan, the Company is relocating and consolidating certain automotive electronics manufacturing plants in North America and China. During 2021, the Company completed the closures and relocation of its automotive electronics manufacturing operations from Burlington, Canada to Celaya, Mexico and from Longgang, Shenzhen, China to Bantian, Shenzhen, China. As of December 31, 2021, the electronics manufacturing in Acuña, Mexico continues to transition to Celaya, Mexico. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized restructuring expense of $ 1,303 for employee separation costs and $ 1,665 for other costs, primarily related to equipment move and set up costs. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized restructuring expense of $( 832 ) for employee separation costs and $ 1,019 for other costs, primarily related to accelerated depreciation and equipment move and set up costs. The net activity for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily related to a reduction in the estimates of previously recognized employee separation costs. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized restructuring expense of $ 4,863 for employee separation costs, and $ 2,087 of other costs, primarily related to accelerated depreciation and fixed asset impairment. The Company has recorded approximately $ 10,105 of restructuring expenses since the inception of this program and as of December 31, 2021, $ 943 remains accrued. Actions under the Plan are expected to be substantially completed by the first half of 2022 and future expenses are expected to be less than $ 1,000 . Other Restructuring Activities As part of the Company’s continued efforts to optimize its cost structure, the Company has undertaken several discrete restructuring actions.

The Credit Agreement has maximum borrowing capacity of $ 475,000 and matures on June 27, 2024 . The Credit Agreement also provides $ 15,000 availability for the issuance of letters of credit and a maximum of $ 40,000 for swing line borrowing. Any amount of the facility utilized for letters of credit or swing line loans outstanding will reduce the amount available under the Credit Agreement. The Company had no outstanding letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The U.S. borrowers and guarantors participating in the Credit Agreement also entered into a related amended and restated pledge and security agreement. The amended and restated pledge and security agreement grants a security interest to the lenders in substantially all of the personal property of the Company and its U.S. subsidiaries designated as borrowers to secure their respective obligations under the Credit Agreement, including the stock and membership interests of specified subsidiaries (limited to 66 % of the stock in the case of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries). In addition to the security obligations, all obligations under the Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by certain of the Company’s subsidiaries. The Credit Agreement restricts, among other things, the amount of dividend payments the Company can make to shareholders. The Credit Agreement contains covenants, that, among other things, (i) prohibit or limit the ability of the borrowers and any material subsidiary to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, pay dividends, make certain types of investments (including acquisitions), enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates, prepay other indebtedness, sell assets, merge with other companies or enter into certain other transactions outside the ordinary course of business, and (ii) require that Gentherm maintain a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio and Consolidated Leverage Ratio (based on consolidated EBITDA for the applicable trailing 12-month period as defined in the Credit Agreement) as of the end of any fiscal quarter. The Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. As of December 31 , 2021, the Company was in compliance with the terms of the Credit Agreement. Under the Credit Agreement, U.S. Dollar denominated loans bear interest at either a base rate (“Base Rate Loans”) or Eurocurrency rate (“Eurocurrency Rate Loans”), plus a margin (“Applicable Rate”). The rate for Base Rate Loans is equal to the highest of the Federal Funds Rate ( 0.07 % at December 31, 2021) plus 0.50 %, Bank of America’s prime rate ( 3.25 % at December 31, 2021), or the Eurocurrency rate plus 1.00 %. The rate for Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in U.S. Dollars is equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate ( 0.10 % at December 31, 2021). All loans denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar must be Eurocurrency Rate Loans. Interest is payable at least quarterly. The Applicable Rate varies based on the Consolidated Leverage Ratio reported by the Company. As long as the Company is not in default of the terms and conditions of the Amended Credit Agreement, the lowest and highest possible Applicable Rate is 1.25 % and 2.25 %, respectively, for Eurocurrency Rate Loans and 0.25 % and 1.25 %, respectively, for Base Rate Loans. F-25 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) In March 2020, the Company increased its borrowings under the Credit Agreement by $ 169,546 as a safeguard to increase its cash position and provide additional financial flexibility due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The proceeds were used for working capital and for other general corporate purposes permitted by the Credit Agreement. As of the end of the first quarter of 2021, the Company repaid the full drawdown of $ 169,546 from March 2020 under the Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2021, $ 35,000 was outstanding under the Credit Agreement. Borrowing availability is subject to, among other things, the Company’s compliance with the minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio and Consolidated Leverage Ratio as of the end of any fiscal quarter. Based upon consolidated EBITDA for the trailing twelve months calculated for purposes of the Consolidated Leverage Ratio, $ 440,000 remained available as of December 31, 2021 for additional borrowings under the Credit Agreement subject to specified conditions that Gentherm currently satisfies. DEG Vietnam Loan The Company also has a fixed interest rate loan with the German Investment Corporation (“DEG”), a subsidiary of KfW Banking Group, a Germany government-owned development bank. The fixed interest rate senior loan agreement with DEG was used to finance the construction and set up of the Vietnam production facility (“DEG Vietnam Loan”). The DEG Vietnam Loan is subject to semi-annual principal payments that began November, 2017 and will end May, 2023 . Under the terms of the DEG Vietnam Loan, the Company must maintain a minimum Enhanced Equity Ratio, as defined by the DEG Vietnam Loan agreement, based on the financial statements of Gentherm’s wholly owned subsidiary, Gentherm Vietnam Co. Ltd. As of December 31, 2021, the Company was in compliance with all terms as outlined in the DEG Vietnam Loan.

Prior service cost is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. F-27 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Plan assets – German Plan Plan assets are comprised of Gentherm GmbH’s pension insurance policies and are pledged to the beneficiaries of the German Plan. A market valuation technique, based on observable underlying insurance charges, is used to determine the fair value of the pension plan assets (Level 2). The expected return on plan assets assumption used to calculate Gentherm GmbH’s pension benefit obligation was determined using actual returns realized on plan assets in the prior year. Contributions We do no t expect contributions to be paid to the U.S. Plan or the German Plan during the next fiscal year. The schedule of future expected pension payments is as follows: Projected Pension Benefit Payments Year U.S Plan German Plan 2022 $ 342 $ 306 2023 342 316 2024 342 309 2025 342 301 2026 342 292 2027-2031 1,710 2,988 Total $ 3,420 $ 4,512 Defined contribution plans The Company also sponsors defined contribution plans for eligible employees.

Note 11 — Commitments and Contingencies Legal and other contingencies The Company may be subject to various legal actions and claims in the ordinary course of its business, including those arising out of breach of contracts, intellectual property rights, environmental matters, regulatory matters and employment-related matters. The Company establishes accruals for matters which it believes that losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these matters, the Company is of the opinion that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial position. Product liability and warranty reserves are recorded separately from legal reserves. Product Liability and Warranty Matters In the event that the Company’s products fail to perform as expected or result in alleged bodily injury or property damage, our products may subject us to warranty claims and product liability. If any of our products are or are alleged to be defective, we may be required to participate in a recall or other corrective action involving such products. The Company maintains liability insurance coverage at levels based on commercial norms and historical claims experience. The Company can provide no assurances that it will not experience material claims in the future or that it will not incur significant costs to defend such claims. F-28 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) The Company accrues warranty obligations for products sold based on management estimates of future failure rates and current claim cost experience, with support from the sales, engineering, quality and legal functions. Using historical information available to the Company, including claims already filed by customers, the warranty accrual is adjusted quarterly to reflect management’s best estimate of future claims. The following is a reconciliation of the changes in accrued warranty costs: Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 Balance at beginning of year $ 2,391 $ 4,596 Warranty claims paid ( 2,164 ) ( 2,598 ) Warranty expense for products shipped during the current period 1,813 1,223 Adjustments to warranty estimates from prior periods ( 73 ) ( 893 ) Adjustments due to currency translation ( 51 ) 63 Balance at end of year $ 1,916 $ 2,391 Other matters Purchase commitments for materials, supplies, services and capital expenditures, as part of the normal course of business, are generally consistent from year to year. Commitments for capital expenditures as of December 31, 2021 were $ 5,388 . During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company entered into agreements with various suppliers to reserve the right to purchase certain semiconductor chips over the next 24 months, with volume commitments determined based on our anticipated production requirements. As of December 31, 2021, the Company’s total commitments for these semiconductor chip agreements was $ 24,457 . Such agreements provide the Company with priority access to semiconductor chips as they become available, however, these agreements do not guarantee that our suppliers will meet the timing and quantities requested by Gentherm. All other purchase commitments as of December 31, 2021 were immaterial . Employees Approximately 23 % of the Company’s workforce are members of industrial trade unions and are employed under the terms of various labor agreements. None of these agreements expire in 2022 . Note 12 — Earnings Per Share The following table illustrates earnings per share and the weighted average shares outstanding used in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share: Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Net income $ 93,434 $ 59,690 $ 48,866 Basic weighted average shares of Common Stock outstanding 33,085,732 32,666,025 33,120,076 Dilutive effect of stock options, restricted stock awards and restricted stock units 423,988 362,079 177,513 Diluted weighted average shares of Common Stock outstanding 33,509,720 33,028,104 33,297,589 Basic earnings per share $ 2.82 $ 1.83 $ 1.48 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.79 $ 1.81 $ 1.47 F-29 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) The following table represents Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of certain stock options that have been excluded from the diluted earnings calculation because the effect of their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

Note 13 —Financial Instruments Derivative Financial Instruments The Company is exposed to various market risks including, but not limited to, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in interest rates and price fluctuations of certain material commodities such as copper. Market risks for changes in interest rates relate primarily to its debt obligations under the Credit Agreement. Foreign currency exchange risks are attributable to sales to foreign customers and purchases from foreign suppliers not denominated in a location’s functional currency, foreign plant operations, intercompany indebtedness, intercompany investments and include exposures to the Euro, Mexican Peso, Canadian Dollar, Hungarian Forint, North Macedonian Denar, Ukrainian Hryvnia, Japanese Yen, Chinese Renminbi, Korean Won and Vietnamese Dong. The Company regularly enters into derivative contracts with the objective of managing its financial and operational exposure arising from these risks by offsetting gains and losses on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the financial instruments used to hedge them. The maximum length of time over which the Company hedges its exposure to foreign currency exchange risks and price fluctuations in material commodities is fifteen months . The Company had foreign currency derivative contracts with a notional value of $ 13,974 and $ 13,299 and copper commodity swap contracts with a notional value of $ 309 and $ 0 outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The principal currency hedged by the Company was the Mexican Peso. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. The Company’s hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedge, and hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions both at the inception of a hedge and on an ongoing basis to be designated for hedge accounting treatment. For derivative contracts which can be classified as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is recorded to AOCI in the consolidated balance sheets. When the underlying hedge transaction is realized, the gain or loss included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss is recorded in earnings in the consolidated statements of income on the same line as the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. The Company records the ineffective portion of foreign currency and copper commodity hedging instruments, if any, to cost of sales, in the consolidated statements of income. Cash flows associated with derivatives are reported in net cash provided by operating activities in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company uses an income approach to value derivative instruments, analyzing quoted market prices to calculate the forward values and then discounting such forward values to the present value using benchmark rates at commonly quoted intervals for the instrument’s full term. Information related to the recurring fair value measurement of derivative financial instruments in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 is as follows: Asset Derivatives Liability Derivatives Hedge Designation Fair Value Hierarchy Balance Sheet Location Fair Value Balance Sheet Location Fair Value Net Asset/ (Liabilities) Foreign currency derivatives Cash flow hedge Level 2 Other current assets $ 294 Other current liabilities $ — $ 294 Commodity hedges Cash flow hedge Level 2 Other current assets $ 6 Other current liabilities $ — $ 6 F-30 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Information related to the recurring fair value measurement of derivative financial instruments in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 is as follows: Asset Derivatives Liability Derivatives Hedge Designation Fair Value Hierarchy Balance Sheet Location Fair Value Balance Sheet Location Fair Value Net Asset/ (Liabilities) Foreign currency derivatives Cash flow hedge Level 2 Other current assets $ 1,513 Other current liabilities $ — $ 1,513 Commodity hedges Cash flow hedge Level 2 Other current assets $ — Other current liabilities $ — $ — Information related to the effect of derivative instruments in the consolidated statements of income is as follows: Year Ended December 31, Location 2021 2020 2019 Foreign currency derivatives Cost of sales $ 1,609 $ ( 1,629 ) $ 1,976 Other comprehensive (loss) income ( 1,217 ) 272 1,151 Foreign currency loss — ( 118 ) ( 46 ) Total foreign currency derivatives $ 392 $ ( 1,475 ) $ 3,081 Commodity derivatives Cost of sales $ 14 $ — $ — Other comprehensive (loss) income 6 — — Total commodity derivatives $ 20 $ — $ — The Company did no t incur any hedge ineffectiveness during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Accounts Receivable Factoring In June 2021, the Company entered into a receivable factoring arrangement that provides for aggregate purchases of up to $ 41,300 of specified customer accounts in North America. The receivable factoring arrangement results in true sales of the transferred receivables, which are excluded from amounts reported in the consolidated condensed balance sheets when the receivables are transferred in accordance with ASC 860, ""Transfers and Servicing”. As of December 31, 2021, there were no outstanding receivables transferred under the receivable factoring agreement. F-31 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Note 14 — Fair Value Measurement Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Fair value measurements are based on one or more of the following three valuation techniques: Market : This approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. Income : This approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present value amount based on current market expectations. Cost : This approach is based on the amount that would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset (replacement cost). The Company uses the following fair value hierarchy to measure fair value into three broad levels, which are described below: Level 1 : Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs. Level 2 : Inputs, other than quoted market prices included in Level 1, that are observable either directly or indirectly for the asset or liability. Level 3 : Unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs. Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Except for derivative financial instruments (see Note 13) and pension plan assets (see Note 10), the Company has no material financial assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value at December 31, 2021 and 2020. In determining fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible and also considers counterparty credit risk in its assessment of fair value. Items Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis The Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a non-recurring basis. As these nonrecurring fair value measurements are generally determined using unobservable inputs, these fair value measurements are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. On July 1, the Company acquired B&E for $ 2,827 . The purchase price was allocated to inventory (Level 2), property and equipment (Level 2) and other intangible assets (Level 3) based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. As of December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, there were no other significant assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Items Not Carried at Fair Value The Company uses an income valuation technique to measure the fair values of its debt instruments by converting amounts of future cash flows to a single present value amount using rates based on current market expectations (Level 2 inputs). As of December 31, 2021, and 2020, the carrying values of the indebtedness under the Company’s Credit Agreement were not materially different than their estimated fair values because the interest rates on variable rate debt approximated rates currently available to the Company (see Note 9). Discount rates used to measure the fair value of Gentherm’s DEG Vietnam Loan are based on quoted swap rates. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of the DEG Vietnam Loan was $ 3,750 , as compared to an estimated fair value of $ 3,778 . As of December 31, 2020, the carrying value of the DEG Vietnam Loan was $ 6,250 as compared to an estimated fair value of $ 6,360 .

Note 17 — Accounting for Stock Based Compensation On May 16, 2013, the Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved the Gentherm Incorporated 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2013 Plan”), covering 3,500,000 shares of our Common Stock. The 2013 Plan was amended on May 19, 2017 to increase the number of available shares by 2,000,000 and further amended on May 21, 2020 to increase the number of available shares by 2,450,000 . The 2013 Plan permits the granting of various awards including stock options (including both nonqualified options and incentive options), stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock and restricted stock units (“RSUs”), performance-based restricted stock units (“PSUs”) shares and certain other awards to employees, outside directors and consultants and advisors of the Company. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had an aggregate of 2,739,534 shares of Common Stock available to issue under the 2013 Plan. All equity plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board. During the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, the Company has outstanding stock options, SARs, restricted stock awards and restricted stock units to employees, directors and consultants. These awards become available to the recipient upon the satisfaction of a vesting condition, either based on a period of service or based on the performance of a specific achievement. For equity-based awards with a service condition, the requisite service period typically ranges between three to four years for employees and consultants and one year for directors. As of December 31, 2021, there were 319,336 PSUs outstanding. These awards cliff vest after three-years based on the Company’s achievement of either a target return on invested capital ratio (“ROIC”), as defined in the award agreement, for a specified fiscal year a target three year cumulative Adjusted EBITDA (“Adjusted EBITDA”), as defined in the award agreement, or the Company’s relative total shareholder return (“TSR”), as defined in the award agreement, during a specific three-year measurement period. In each case, awards will be earned at 50 % of the target number of shares for achieving a minimum threshold or up to 200 % of the target number of shares for exceeding the target, with a linear adjustment between threshold and target or between target and stretch performance goals. All other outstanding, unvested equity-based awards were service based. Equity-based award vesting may be accelerated at the discretion of the Board under conditions specified in the 2013 plan. Under FASB ASC Topic 718, the provisions of the PSUs that vest upon the achievement of relative TSR are considered a market condition, and therefore the effect of that market condition is reflected in the grant date fair value for this portion award. A third party was engaged to complete a Monte Carlo simulation to account for the market condition. That simulation takes into account the beginning stock price of our common stock, the expected volatilities for the relative TSR comparator group, the expected volatilities for the Company’s stock price, correlation coefficients, the expected risk-free rate of return and the expected dividend yield of the Company and the comparator group. The single grant-date fair value computed by this valuation method is recognized by the Company in accounting for the awards regardless of the actual future outcome of the relative TSR feature. The grant date fair value of the other PSUs and RSUs are calculated as the closing price of our common stock as quoted on Nasdaq on the grant date multiplied by the number of shares subject to the award. Each of ROIC and Adjusted EBITDA is considered a performance condition and the grant-date fair value for ROIC PSUs and Adjusted EBITDA PSUs corresponds with management's expectation of the probable outcome of the performance condition as of the grant date.

The state NOL carryforwards generally expire at various dates from 2022 to 2041 . We have concluded that there is not sufficient evidence these NOL carryforwards will be utilized, and thus have not recognized the benefit of these NOL carryforwards. At December 31, 2021, certain non-U.S. subsidiaries had NOL carryforwards totaling $ 199,153 which have no expiration date .

The reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Balance at beginning of year $ 4,967 $ 3,795 $ 2,819 Additions based on tax position related to current year 1,105 1,489 661 Additions based on tax position related to prior year 160 179 352 Reductions from settlements and statute of limitation expiration ( 312 ) ( 650 ) — Effect of foreign currency translation ( 255 ) 154 ( 37 ) Balance at end of year $ 5,665 $ 4,967 $ 3,795 The Company classifies income tax-related penalties and net interest as income tax expense. In the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, income tax related interest and penalties were not material. It is reasonably possible that audit settlements, the conclusions of current examinations or the expiration of the statute of limitations in several jurisdictions could impact the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits. Note 19 — Segment Reporting Segment information is used by management for making operating decisions for the Company. Management evaluates the performance of the Company’s segments based primarily on operating income or loss. The Company’s reportable segments are as follows: • Automotive — this segment represents the design, development, manufacturing and sales of automotive climate comfort systems, automotive cable systems, battery performance solutions, and automotive electronic and software systems. • Medical — this segment represents the results from our patient temperature management business within the medical industry. The Corporate category includes unallocated costs related to our corporate headquarter activities, including selling, general and administrative costs and acquisition transaction costs, which do not meet the requirements for being classified as an operating segment.

Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), are made available free of charge through our website, www.gentherm.com , as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file them with or furnish them to the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports are also available on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s website, www.sec.gov . COVID-19 Impact on our Business The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted global economic activity, including within the automotive market and our business. Our sales are driven by the number of light vehicles produced by OEMs and our content per vehicle. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted, and is expected to continue to significantly disrupt, the global automotive industry and customer sales, production volumes and purchases of light vehicles by end consumers. Per IHS Markit (February 2021 release), global light vehicle production volume was down 14.4% in 2020 from 2019 in the Company’s key markets of North America, Europe, China, Japan and Korea. In the first half of 2020, we were adversely affected by temporary manufacturing closures and customer plant closures, supply chain and production disruptions, workforce restrictions and travel restrictions, among other factors. While the operations of the Company, our customers and our supply chain improved in the second half of the year, the pandemic continued to adversely impact various aspects of our operations during such period. Our business is subject to continuing and uncertain risks depending on the progression of the pandemic and the recovery of the global economy. In addition to challenges faced in 2020, recent pandemic-related issues have exacerbated port congestion and intermittent supplier shutdowns and delays, resulting in additional expenses to expedite delivery of critical parts and manufacturing delays. Similarly, increased demand for personal electronics has created a shortfall of semiconductors, and it is yet unknown how we may be impacted. Our suppliers have experienced plant closures and production delays, and may continue to experience delays in manufacturing the materials and products we require according to our schedule and specifications. Certain companies in our supply chain have had significant employee layoffs or furloughs and have significant financial distress, and some may determine to cease operations or restructure their business. As a result, we and our supply chain may operate significantly below capacity for an uncertain 4 period of time. Further, COVID-19 has had, and we expect will continue to have, a significant adverse impact on the growth, viability and financial stability of our customers, including the OEMs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers to which our products are supplied. The Company has implemented additional health and safety precautions and protocols in response to the pandemic and government guidelines to help ensure the safety and health of its employees. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant portion of our non-production employees are now working from home. We continue to assess and update business continuity plans in the context of this pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on global automotive markets in 2021, in the form of supply chain and production disruptions, workforce restrictions, travel restrictions and reduced consumer spending, among other factors. There remains substantial uncertainty regarding the global economic impact of, and the speed and shape of the recovery from, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including for the global automotive industry and the resulting impact on our future operations and financial results. See further discussion of the risks relating to the COVID-19 pandemic and related risks in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Segments The Company has two reportable segments for financial reporting purposes: Automotive and Medical. Automotive The Automotive reporting segment is comprised of the results from our global automotive businesses. Operating results from our climate comfort systems, automotive cable systems, battery performance solutions, automotive electronic and software systems and our advanced research and development organization are all reported in the Automotive segment because of their complementary focus on automotive content, passenger thermal comfort and convenience. In 2020, we added our advanced research and development organization to this reporting segment. Climate comfort systems include seat heaters, blowers and thermoelectric devices for variable temperature Climate Control Seats (“CCS”) and steering wheel heaters designed to provide individualized thermal comfort to automobile passengers, and integrated electronic components, such as electronic control units that utilize our proprietary electronics technology and software. Other climate comfort systems include neck conditioners and climate control system products for door panels, armrests, cupholders and storage bins. Battery performance solutions (formerly battery thermal management) consist of cell connecting devices used for various types of automotive batteries and thermal management products for heating and cooling 12V, 48V and high voltage batteries and battery modules. Automotive electronic and software systems include electronic control units for climate comfort systems, electronic control units for memory seat modules and other devices. Medical In 2018 and 2019, our Industrial reporting segment represented the combined results from our patient temperature management systems business (“Medical”), remote power generation systems business, Gentherm Global Power Technologies (“GPT”) (through its divestiture on October 1, 2019), environmental test equipment business, Cincinnati Sub Zero industrial chamber business (“CSZ-IC”) (through its divestiture on February 1, 2019) and non-automotive expenses from our advanced research and development division (through December 31, 2019). The operating results from these businesses and division previously were presented together as one reporting segment because of their historical joint concentration on identifying new markets and product applications based on thermal management technologies. In 2020, the Industrial reporting segment was renamed the Medical reporting segment to reflect the patient temperature management business as the focus and strategic direction of this segment. Also, during 2020, the advanced research and development costs not associated with the Medical segment were moved to the Automotive segment, as this organization primarily supports the Automotive related research and development activities following the divestitures of GPT and CSZ-IC. 5 Business Strategy Globally we develop, manufacture, and deliver advanced thermal solutions for automotive and patient thermal management markets that make meaningful differences in everyday life around the world by improving health, wellness, comfort and energy efficiency. To achieve our goals and capitalize on opportunities within the automotive and patient thermal management markets, we launched in mid-2018 and continue to implement four primary strategies: Focus Growth The focused growth strategy includes four key goals: ▪ Accelerate growth in our core automotive climate and comfort businesses by leveraging human thermophysiology and smart control algorithms to increase personalized passenger comfort and improve energy efficiency; ▪ Introduce an innovative microclimate solution, ClimateSense TM , which offers personalized thermal comfort in one intelligent and integrated system; ▪ Drive battery performance solutions with increased focus on active battery heating and cooling, passive battery cooling, battery heaters, and cell connecting board solutions; and ▪ Expand patient thermal management solutions that leverage our expertise in thermophysiology and drive synergies from our automotive climate and comfort businesses. These areas of the focused growth strategy are underpinned and enabled by our electronic and software systems business. Extend Technology Leadership We continue to expand our technology leadership with focused investments in key core technologies and competencies, including thermophysiology, software and electronics, simulation, thermal engines and integration. Expand Gross Margin and Return on Invested Capital We are strengthening our operational discipline and execution to expand gross margin and return on invested capital. This strategy centers around building a culture of performance that includes a focus on high-return growth opportunities. It also included the divestiture of non-core investments, which was completed in 2019. During 2018, we initiated this strategy through the sale of our battery management systems division located in Irvine, California and the site consolidation of its advanced research and development operations, which resulted in vacating two lease facilities in Azusa, California. Further, we exited several product categories including furniture, aviation, battery management electronics, industrial battery packs, automotive thermoelectric generators and other non-core electronics. Additionally, we undertook restructuring actions to reduce global overhead costs to improve Selling, general and administrative expenses. Optimize Capital Allocation We are optimizing our capital allocation to drive shareholder returns, which includes stock repurchases, while allowing us to reinvest in our business to drive continued growth through capital expenditure projects, and focused research and development investments. Further, we continuously evaluate acquisition opportunities that will enhance other business strategies. Research, Development and Partnerships Our research, development and partnerships activities are an essential part of our efforts to develop new or improved innovative products. Through both internal and external programs, we are working to develop a comprehensive knowledge of thermal management systems that can demonstrate functionality and performance. These activities are critical to optimizing energy and production efficiencies, improving effectiveness in our products and minimizing the cost to integrate our products with those of our customers. We perform advanced research and development on thermal management systems, including those that utilize new proprietary comfort software algorithms, to enhance the efficiency and functionality of our automotive heating and cooling products. We believe there are substantial opportunities to integrate innovative thermal management systems into current and future product applications. 6 To offer our customers cutting-edge products and technologies, our strategy includes partnering with key technology leaders in our industry. Our advanced partnership with global automakers and manufactures address and work to solve industry preferences of today and tomorrow by leveraging our expertise in human thermophysiology. Research and development is conducted around the globe, predominately at our world headquarters in Northville, Michigan, our Technology Center in Farmington Hills, Michigan and our European research facilities in Odelzhausen, Germany. Additional product development is performed at all of our manufacturing facilities to support customers. We believe the localized development model employed at our global design and manufacturing facilities improves our ability to effectively serve our customers and increases our innovative capacity. Core Technologies Gentherm’s expertise in thermal management is focused on two general areas: managing the thermal conditions of people and objects. ClimateSense TM ClimateSense is an integrated comfort system we are designing to create a personalized microclimate for passengers using localized convective, conductive and radiative heating and cooling products. Using automatic regulation technology in combination with our unique occupant-centric control algorithm, ClimateSense offers the ability to personalize and improve overall occupant thermal comfort, improve time to comfort with (all-electric) pre-conditioning, provide comfort with less energy consumption thereby lowering carbon dioxide emissions by conventional internal combustion and hybrid powertrains, and extend range for electrified powertrains through a reduction in central HVAC system usage. Electronics Gentherm manufactures and supplies electronics to our core climate comfort solution products. We also supply value-added electronic products to third parties for adjacent areas within the automotive interior. In addition, Gentherm manufacturers and supplies electronic control units for memory seat modules that include electric motor position sensing technology. This technology further applies to other automotive products requiring fine motor controls. Air Moving Devices Our highly durable and quiet air moving devices, including our proprietary blower and fan designs, are essential to all of our products that require air movement. We have a strong portfolio of these products, tailored to various automotive application, including seat ventilation and EV battery cooling. Thermoelectric Technologies Many of our thermal products manage the thermal conditions of people and objects using our internally developed advanced thermoelectric device technology (“TED”). A TED is a solid-state circuit that has the capability to produce both hot and cold thermal conditions by use of the Peltier effect. The advantages of advanced TEDs over conventional compressed gas systems are that they are environmentally friendly and less complex as they have no moving parts and are compact and light weight. Over the last 19 years, our work on this technology has yielded improvements in areas of functionality, efficiency, durability and performance. Resistive Heaters Resistive heater technologies are comprised of wire, carbon fiber or positive thermal coefficient (“PTC”) heating elements that quickly and effectively deliver heat to people and objects. Wire heating elements are designed from stainless steel, copper, our proprietary carbon fiber woven lattice technology called Carbotex® or printed circuit PTC heaters based on the specifications for a particular product application. Resistive heaters have multiple automotive applications, including seat heating, steering wheel heating, interior panel heating, and battery heating. 7 Products Climate Comfort Solutions – Seat Comfort Climate Control Seat ® (“CCS”) Our CCS products utilize exclusive patented technology to regulate temperature and enhance the comfort of vehicle passengers. The most advanced CCS models use one or more TEDs to generate heating or cooling depending upon the direction of the current applied to the device. A TED is the heart of a compact heat pump used in our active CCS products. Air is forced through the heat pump and thermally conditioned in response to electronic switch input from the seat occupant. The conditioned air circulates by one of our specially designed air moving devices through a proprietary air distribution system installed in the seat cushion and seat back, so that the seat surface can be heated or cooled. Each seat has individual electronic controls to adjust the level of heating or cooling. Active CCS products improve comfort compared with conventional air conditioners by focusing cooling directly on the passenger through the seat rather than waiting until ambient air cools the seat surface beneath the passenger. A heated and ventilated variant of the CCS utilizes ambient cabin air to provide cooling comfort instead of a TED to actively cool the seat. In the heating mode, both the vent-only system and the TED system can be supplemented with resistive heating elements. Heated and ventilated CCS products provide a lower level of cooling capability than our active CCS solution, but at a lower price. By offering different models of the CCS product, our customers have the opportunity to purchase a wider range of climate control products at different price points. Sales of CCS products contributed 38%, 37% and 36% to our total product revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Heated Seat Heated seats, based on our resistive heater core technology, are seamlessly integrated into automotive seat designs, and are constructed using materials that offer the best capacity, installation characteristics and durability. Our capabilities allow customers to choose among a variety of resistive heater materials based on their individual vehicle specifications. Sales of heated seat products contributed 27%, 29% and 29% to our total product revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Neck Climate Control Systems Neck climate control systems ventilate warm or temperature-controlled air directly onto the passenger’s neck area. The system combines electronics, air moving device technologies and a heating element into a compact, integrated headrest design that can be adjusted to suit the body size of the passenger. Climate Comfort Solutions – Surface Climate Control Systems Heated Steering Wheel Heated steering wheels deliver heating comfort to automobile drivers through resistive elements. This product can be applied to both leather and wood steering wheels. A solution for drivers in cold and mild weather climates, the heated steering wheel is designed for the global automotive market. Heated Surfaces Gentherm’s thermally conductive or radiative surfaces, such as door panel armrest and center console armrest products, are powered by our core technologies. The system is thermally managed by a heating control system which can be discretely located in the door panel or seat of the vehicle. Heated door panels and armrests complement our climate-controlled seat and steering wheel products and provide a superior level of thermal comfort to the driving experience. Electronics Solutions Memory Seat Modules Gentherm has developed a unique way to control certain electrical motors in a vehicle. Our Intelligent Positioning System, IPS ® product suite utilizes proprietary software to determine the position of a power seat and control the Memory Seat module. 8 Hands-On Detection All vehicles manufactured with Autonomous Driving Level 2 or higher capabilities are required to ensure that the driver stays in control of the vehicle during operation. In order to accomplish this task, Gentherm developed PilotSense TM – a sensor integrated into the steering wheel that monitors whether the driver’s hands are maintaining contact with the steering wheel. This product is available for both heated and non-heated steering wheels. Battery Performance Solutions (“BPS”) Cell Connecting Systems Cell connecting systems provide secure connections between advanced automotive batteries to transmit a continuous flow of information about battery temperature and cell voltage during the charging and discharging process to monitor battery system performance. Gentherm has developed a range of cell connecting system products, including flexible foil cell connecting boards that offer improved packaging, weight and functionality. We offer these products in a variety of materials to cover customers’ requirements. Thermoelectric Battery Thermal Management (“BTM”) Thermal management is critically important for the long-term operation of advanced automotive batteries. The expansion of electrified vehicle applications, such as Battery Electric Vehicles, Plug-In Hybrids and Mild Hybrids, have drastically increased the demand for BTM systems that enable wider operating temperature ranges, enhanced driving range and prolonged life of the battery. Gentherm’s BTM system can provide precision battery cooling of 48 Volt Mild Hybrid systems on pack or cell-level using patented TED technology. The BTM system maintains the temperature of the lithium-ion battery or other advanced chemistry battery within an acceptable temperature range without the use of chilled liquids or refrigerant loops, making it a light weight, highly scalable, compact solution ideal for automotive applications. Gentherm’s proprietary BTM system is compact and energy efficient, resulting in a minimal energy budget, which is important for an electrified vehicle. Aside from battery cooling, Gentherm’s BTM portfolio includes battery heating applications. Based on our proprietary technology, we offer solutions to our customers that enable efficient heating of lithium-ion batteries for most electrified vehicles. Climate Comfort Solutions – Thermal Convenience TrueTherm TM Cup Holder The TrueTherm cup holder applies Gentherm’s patented TED technologies to keep beverages of automobile drivers and passengers either warm or cool. We have developed a range of cup holder models with varying degrees of functionality, designed to be packaged in multiple configurations to accommodate different console environments. Our dual independent design provides separate temperature settings in each holder allowing the driver and passenger to individually maintain a heated or cooled beverage. TrueTherm TM Storage Unit Gentherm’s TrueTherm storage units provide for food or beverage cooling for the global automotive market. Using patented TED or refrigeration technologies, the TrueTherm cool storage unit provides temperature control independently from a vehicle’s heating and air conditioning system. It can be custom designed to accommodate tight interior spaces, such as the front floor console of a sport utility vehicle (SUV) and provide additional cooling capacity to those who have long work commutes or transport multiple passengers.

The Stihler core brands include ASTOPAD® patient warming system, ASTOTHERM®/ASTOFLO® IV fluid and blood warming systems and ASTODIA® diaphanoscope for transillumination. The ASTOPAD® patient warming system utilizes resistive warming technology which is also used in our automotive products. Gentherm is now focused on globalizing the Stihler portfolio and integrating across key sales channels. Customers Our Automotive segment customers include light vehicle OEMs, commercial vehicle OEMs and first tier (“Tier 1”) suppliers to the automotive OEMs, including automotive seat manufacturers. We also directly supply CCS products to aftermarket seat distributors and installers. The Company’s automotive marketing is directed primarily at automotive manufacturers and their Tier 1 suppliers and focuses on the enhanced value consumers attribute to vehicles with climate comfort products. In many cases, the manufacturers direct us to work with their suppliers to integrate our products into the vehicle’s seat or interior design. These customers will sell our product, as a component of an entire seat or seating system, to automotive OEMs. Once the integration work is complete, prototypes are sent to the manufacturer for evaluation and testing. If a manufacturer accepts our product, a program can then be launched for a particular model on a production basis, but it normally takes one to three years from the time a manufacturer decides to include any of our products in a vehicle model to actual production for that vehicle. During this process, we derive funding from prototype sales but obtain no significant revenue until mass production begins. Inherent to the automotive supplier market are costs and commitments that are incurred well in advance of the receipt of orders and resulting revenues from customers. The volume of products we sell is significantly affected by global automotive production levels and the general business conditions in the automotive industry. Our product revenues are generally based upon purchase orders issued by our customers, with updated releases for volume adjustments. As such, we typically do not have a backlog of firm orders at any point in time. Once selected to supply products for a particular platform, we typically supply those products for the platform life, which is normally five to seven years, although there is no guarantee that this will occur. In addition, when we are the incumbent supplier to a given platform, we believe we have a competitive advantage in winning the redesign or replacement platform, although there is no guarantee that this will occur. For 2020, our revenues from sales to our two largest customers, Lear and Adient were $141 million and $132 million, respectively, representing 15% and 14% of our product revenues, respectively. Revenues from Lear and Adient represent sales of our climate comfort products. The loss of these customers would likely have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and cash flows. However, as noted above, in many cases OEMs direct their suppliers such as Lear and Adient to work with us for our climate comfort solutions, battery performance solutions and cable technology products. It is, therefore, relevant to understand how our revenues are divided among the OEMs, as shown below. 10 Our total product revenues for each of the past three years were divided among automotive OEMs as follows: 2020 2019 2018 General Motors 14 % 14 % 14 % Hyundai 12 % 9 % 7 % Ford Motor Company 9 % 11 % 10 % Volkswagen 9 % 8 % 9 % Stellantis (a) 9 % 10 % 10 % Honda 6 % 7 % 6 % Daimler 6 % 6 % 5 % BMW 6 % 6 % 4 % Mazda 3 % 4 % 3 % Toyota Motor Corporation 3 % 4 % 3 % Renault/Nissan 2 % 3 % 4 % Jaguar/Land Rover 3 % 3 % 3 % Other (including Medical) 18 % 15 % 22 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % a) Reflective of the 2021 merger of PSA and Fiat Chrysler.

Production and Suppliers Our global manufacturing and distribution facilities are located close to our key customers. In Europe we operate three manufacturing sites located in Macedonia, Germany and Ukraine and one distribution center located in Hungary. In North America, we operate four manufacturing sites in Mexico, one in the United States and one in Canada. In Asia, we operate three production sites in China and one in Vietnam. In September 2019, we committed to a restructuring plan to improve our manufacturing productivity and rationalize our footprint. In March 2020, we announced the initial phase of this restructuring plan, which includes the 11 consolidation of all North American electronics manufacturing to Celaya, Mexico. This will result in the closure of the Burlington, Canada facility, and the transfer of electronics manufacturing to Acuña, Mexico. In December 2020, we announced the consolidation of our electronics manufacturing in Asia to Bantian, Shenzhen, China, which will result in the closure of our Longgang, Shenzhen, China facility that is expected to be completed by the end of 2021. See Note 5, ""Restructuring"" of the consolidated financial statements included in this Report for additional information. The automotive industry is highly reliant on semiconductors and, beginning in the fourth quarter 2020 and continuing in 2021, is facing a significant supply shortage of semiconductors. In the first half of 2020, global semiconductor manufacturers and their distributors allocated capacity to meet surging demand for consumer electronics and away from the automotive sector that was experiencing plant shutdowns. Given capacity constraints and long lead times for restarting production, semiconductor manufacturers became further strained when automotive vehicle production and other industries utilizing semiconductors had a strong rebound in the second half of 2020. Such activity has resulted in significant supply shortages and cost increases across the automotive industry, and has an adverse impact on our business. We continue to closely monitor the availability of semiconductor microchips and other key component parts and raw materials, as well as customer vehicle production schedules that may be impacted by supply shortages and disruptions. We are working closely with our suppliers and customers to minimize any potential adverse impacts. See further discussion of the risks relating to the supply shortage of semiconductors and related risks in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Proprietary Rights and Patents The development of new or improved technologies is critical to the execution of our business strategy. Patents obtained for new or improved technologies form an important basis for the success of the Company and underpin the success of our research and development efforts. We have adopted a policy of obtaining, where practical, the exclusive rights to use technology related to our products through patents or licenses for proprietary technologies or processes. We adapt and commercialize such technologies in products for mass production. We also have developed technologies or furthered the development of acquired technologies through internal research and development efforts. As of December 31, 2020, Gentherm held 518 issued patents, of which 253 were U.S. patents and 265 were non-U.S. patents. Gentherm held 393 patents directed to climate control products and thermoelectric technologies, 62 patents directed at heating elements and technologies, 22 patents directed to medical technologies, 17 patents directed to air moving devices and 24 patents directed to cable and cell connector battery technologies. In furtherance of its Focused Growth strategy, the Company continued to evaluate its patents during 2020 and made strategic decisions to reduce low-value patents and patents unrelated to current or planned business strategies. Competition See further discussion of the risks relating to competition in Item 1A, “Risk Factors”. Gentherm faces competition from other automotive suppliers and, with respect to certain products, from the automobile OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers who produce or have the capability to produce certain products that Gentherm supplies. The automotive supply industry competes on the basis of technology, quality, reliability of supply and price. Design, engineering capability and competitive pricing are increasingly important factors. The competitive landscape for Gentherm’s climate comfort solutions and battery sub-systems includes component specialists, thermal management system suppliers and Tier 1 suppliers or automobile OEMs with their own integrated solutions. Independent suppliers that represent the principal competitors of Gentherm include I.G. Bauerhin GmbH, Kongsberg Automotive ASA, Lisa DRÄXLMAIER GmbH and ElringKlinger AG. The competitive landscape for patient temperature management systems includes patient thermal management medical device OEMs. The principal manufacturers of products similar to those of Gentherm’s products include 3M Company Co, Stryker Corporation and Becton, Dickinson and Company. We believe our expertise in core thermal management technologies and occupant thermal comfort, as well as our capability in application specific component design, global footprint and broad product offerings make us well positioned to compete against the traditional thermal management systems suppliers, global Tier 1s and component specialists. 12 Seasonality Our principal operations are directly related to the automotive industry. Consequently, we have historically experienced seasonal fluctuations to the extent automotive vehicle production slows, such as in the summer months when many customer plants close for model year changeovers and in December when many customer plants close for the holidays. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our product revenues were adversely affected by customer plant closures and temporary, partial closures of several of our manufacturing facilities in North America and Europe during the first half of 2020. During the second half of 2020, our customers’ plants were open, and our production volumes were stronger than pre-COVID levels at our manufacturing facilities. Human Capital Management Employees At Gentherm, we believe our global workforce and our global footprint are a competitive advantage, not only from the global diversity of customers, but the richness of the diversity of our people. Gentherm resides in over 23 locations across 13 countries. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, Gentherm’s employment levels worldwide were as follows: 2020 2019 Mexico 3,938 4,130 Macedonia 2,131 1,871 China 1,605 1,812 Ukraine 1,722 1,725 Vietnam 916 909 United States and Canada 618 694 Germany 263 255 Hungary 253 252 Korea 36 37 Japan 20 23 Malta 12 13 United Kingdom 5 5 Total 11,519 11,726 Notable statistics as of December 31, 2020: ▪ Over 59% of our global workforce is Female. ▪ 40% of our workforce resides in North America; 38% of our workforce resides in Europe; 22% of our workforce resides in Asia. ▪ We have cooperative relationships in our facilities where we operate with unions and workers councils.

These actions indicate the strength of our commitment to sustainability across Gentherm. I TEM 1A. RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider each of the risks, assumptions, uncertainties and other factors described below and elsewhere in this Report, as well as any amendments or updates reflected in subsequent filings or furnishings with the SEC. We believe these risks, assumptions, uncertainties and other factors, individually or in the aggregate, could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results and could materially and adversely affect our business operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Industry and Operational Risks The COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken to contain it have significantly adversely affected, and are likely to continue to significantly adversely affect, our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and stock price . The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly and adversely impacted the global economy and financial markets, with global legislative and regulatory responses including unprecedented monetary and fiscal policy actions across all sectors. Our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and stock price were significantly adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, especially beginning in March. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on global markets, in the form of supply chain and production disruptions, workforce restrictions and travel restrictions, among other factors, which continues to have significant adverse impacts on Gentherm’s financial performance and operations. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and stock price remains uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence. In particular, if COVID-19 continues to spread or re-emerges or the vaccine rollout is slow or delayed, resulting in an extended period of travel, commercial, social and other similar restrictions or shut-downs, 14 we could experience prolonged and significant adverse impacts to our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and stock price. The COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken to contain it have subjected, and continue to subject, our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and stock price to a number of material risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to: ▪ Risks Related to our Liquidity . In March 2020, we borrowed $169.5 million as a safeguard to provide additional financial flexibility. After the drawdown in March 2020 and through December 31, 2020, the Company repaid a net amount of $41.2 million of the amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, our consolidated indebtedness was $192.4 million. In January 2021, the Company repaid an additional $80.0 million of the amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement. Our increased indebtedness has and will continue to result in, among other things, increased interest expense and increased vulnerability to future adverse economic and industry conditions. Future borrowing availability under our Amended Credit Agreement is subject to our compliance with financial covenants thereunder (including the Consolidated Leverage Ratio based on consolidated EBITDA for the applicable trailing 12-month period). Based upon consolidated EBITDA for the trailing twelve months calculated for purposes of the Consolidated Leverage Ratio, $288.8 million remains available for additional borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement subject to specified conditions that Gentherm currently satisfies. Subject to any amendment or waiver of the Consolidated Leverage Ratio from the lenders, the Company’s borrowing availability for the next twelve months could continue to be less than the full amount of capacity available under the U.S. Revolving Note due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic and industry conditions . Failure to satisfy certain covenants in the Amended Credit Agreement would result in an event of default, following which our lenders could declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable and there is no guarantee that we would be able to repay, refinance, or restructure the payments on such debt on acceptable terms or at all. Further, under the Amended Credit Agreement, the lenders would have the right to foreclose on certain of our assets, which could have a significant adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and stock price. We may finance additional liquidity needs in the future through one or more equity or debt offerings. The current disruption of the global financial markets could reduce our ability to access additional capital on acceptable terms or at all, which would negatively affect our liquidity and may adversely impact our operations and results of operations. ▪ Risks Related to the Automotive Industry . The automotive industry is our primary market. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted, and is expected to continue to significantly disrupt, the global automotive industry and customer sales, production volumes and purchases of light vehicles by end consumers. Further, the spread of COVID-19 has created a significant disruption in the manufacturing, delivery and overall supply chain of automobile manufacturers and suppliers. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a temporary shutdown of substantially all of the major OEMs in our markets at various times in the first half of 2020. There remains substantial uncertainty regarding the global economic impact of, and the speed and shape of the recovery from, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including for the global automotive industry and the resulting impact on our future operations and financial results. ▪ Risks Related to our Supply Chain and our Manufacturing Operations . The COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacted the first half of 2020 and to a lesser extent the second half of 2020, and may continue to adversely impact, our ability to manufacture products and obtain materials from our supply chain. We and our suppliers experienced facility closures, work stoppages, travel restrictions, implementation of precautionary health and safety measures and other restrictions. We also experienced extended work stoppages globally as the pandemic spread and governmental authorities initiated “lock-down” orders for all non-essential activities. Our manufacturing operations resumed production during the first quarter of 2020 in Asia, and during the second quarter of 2020 in North America and Europe, under enhanced public health procedures, including temperature screening of employees before entry into facilities, frequent deep cleaning of facilities, installation of barriers to separate employees and the provision of personal protective equipment. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a significant portion of our non-production employees are now working from home, which may harm our ability to manage our business and increase operational risk, including increased cyber security attacks and reduced ability to implement security measures. Further, certain companies in our supply chain have had significant employee layoffs or furloughs and have significant financial distress, and some may determine to cease operations or restructure their business. Our suppliers have experienced plant closures and production delays, and may continue to experience delays in manufacturing the materials and products we require according to our schedule and specifications, and we may need to seek alternate suppliers, which may be more expensive or may result in delays. As a result, we and our supply chain may operate significantly below capacity for an uncertain period of time, each of which could significantly adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and stock price. 15 ▪ Risks Related to our Customers . COVID-19 has had, and we expect will continue to have, a significant adverse impact on the growth, viability and financial stability of our customers, including the OEMs and Tier 1 automotive suppliers to which our products are supplied. In addition to many of the risks noted above that apply to our customers regarding the automotive industry generally and our supply chain, we have experienced, and we may experience, a delay in our collection of accounts receivable balances from our customers, which may be significant and would be at risk in the event of their bankruptcy or other restructuring. ▪ Risks Related to our Growth Prospects . Our ability to execute our business strategy through the pursuit of business ventures, acquisitions, and strategic alliances or dispositions has been, and will likely continue to be, significantly adversely impacted by COVID-19 and global economic conditions. While we continue to believe in our long-term growth strategy and prospects, we have limited, and may continue to limit, certain growth opportunities in the near term to conserve cash and working capital. We also believe that new business awards will be subject to increased risk of future change as we look to convert awards into revenue. Further, a sustained decline in automotive production may delay or reduce our returns on research and development investments, which could significantly adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and stock price. The risks related to these factors above are discussed in greater detail below in separate risk factors. The automotive industry, our primary market, is cyclical and a decline in the production levels of our major customers, particularly with respect to models for which we supply significant amounts of product, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our Automotive segment represents 95%, 95% and 91% of our product revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Demand for our automotive products is directly related to automotive vehicle production, which is ultimately dependent on consumer demand for automotive vehicles, and our content per vehicle. Automotive sales and production are cyclical and have been, and we expect will continue to be, materially affected by general economic and industry conditions, labor relations issues, fuel prices, regulatory requirements, government initiatives, trade agreements, the availability and cost of credit for us, customers and consumers and other factors. The inability of our supply chain, or the supply chain of the OEMs and Tier 1s that we supply, to deliver key components, such as semiconductors, could materially adversely affect our business, profitability and results of operations. Our products contain a significant number of components that we source globally from suppliers who, in turn, source components from their global suppliers. If our supply chain fails to deliver products to us in sufficient quality and quantity on a timely basis, we will be challenged to meet our production schedules, fulfilling our orders, sales and profits could decline, and our commercial reputation and customer relationships could be damaged. Similarly, OEMs and Tier 1s to whom we supply our products are dependent on an ever-greater number of global suppliers to manufacture and sell their products to consumers, which drives sales of our products. These global supply chains have been and may be adversely impacted by events outside of our and their control, including macroeconomic events, trade restrictions, economic recessions, political crises, labor relations issues, liquidity constraints, or natural occurrences, such as the ongoing disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic. Any significant disruptions to such supply chains could materially adversely affect our business, profitability and results of operations. The automotive industry is highly reliant on semiconductors and, beginning in the fourth quarter 2020 and continuing in 2021, is facing a significant shortage of semiconductors. The semiconductor supply chain is complex, with capacity constraints occurring throughout. We, the OEMs and Tier 1s must compete among the automotive supply chain and with other industries to satisfy current and near-term requirements for semiconductors, and such allocation is not within our control even though we attempt various mitigating actions. Certain semiconductors we utilize are sourced from a very limited number of suppliers, which further exacerbates the risks to our operations. A shortage of semiconductors or other key components (historically, such as TEDs), especially if prolonged, can disrupt our production schedule and have an adverse effect on our business, profitability and results of operations. OEM and Tier 1 production could also be impacted by this shortage, which would result in reduced sales of our products and could be materially adverse to our operations, profitability and results of operations. We operate in a highly competitive industry and efforts by our competitors, as well as new non-traditional entrants to the industry could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The automotive component supply industry is subject to intense competition. Business is typically awarded to the supplier offering the most favorable combination of cost, quality, timely delivery, technological innovation and service. There can be no 16 assurance that we will be able to compete successfully with the products of our competitors. Further, our competitors’ efforts to grow market share could exert downward pressure on our product pricing and margins. Many of our competitors are substantially larger in size and have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do, and therefore may be more effective in adapting to customer requirements while being more profitable. In addition, our customers may increase levels of production insourcing for a variety of reasons, such as shifts in customers’ business strategies or the emergence of low-cost production opportunities in other countries , which may adversely affect our sales as well as the profit margins on our products. In addition, the global automotive industry is experiencing a period of significant technological change. Future automotive vehicle production may be affected by additional industry or consumer behaviors, including the development and use of autonomous and electric vehicles and increasing use of car- and ride-sharing and on-demand transportation as a service, as well as related regulations. The rapidly evolving nature of the markets in which we compete has attracted, and may continue to attract, new entrants, including new entrants from outside the traditional automotive supply industry. Further, in comparison to us, our competitors may foresee the course of market developments more accurately, develop superior products, produce similar products at a lower cost, or adapt quicker to new technologies. If we do not accurately predict, prepare for and respond to new kinds of technological innovations, market developments and changing customer needs, our sales, profitability and long-term competitiveness may be harmed. We manage our business based on projected future sales volume, which is highly dependent on information received from customers and general market data, and any inaccuracies or changes in such information could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We manage our business based upon projected future sales volumes, which are based upon many factors, including awarded business and assumptions of conversion rates thereof, customers’ forecasts and general market data. Our customers generally do not guarantee sales volumes. In addition, awarded business may include business under arrangements that our customers have the right to terminate without penalty at any time. Further, our customers’ forecasts are subject to numerous assumptions, and such forecasts often are/may be changed rapidly with limited notice. Therefore, our actual sales volumes, and thus the ultimate amount of revenue that we derive from such sales, are not committed. If actual production orders from our customers are not consistent with our projected future sales volumes, we could realize substantially less revenue and incur greater expenses over the life of vehicle programs. The loss or insolvency of any of our principal customers would adversely affect our future results. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our top two customers were Lear and Adient which comprised 15% and 14%, respectively, of our product revenues. We are dependent on the continued growth, viability and financial stability of our customers, as well as the OEMS to which our products are supplied. The loss of any significant portion of our sales to any of our customers would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. W e have experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, a delay in our collection of accounts receivable balances from our customers, which may be significant and would be at risk in the event of their bankruptcy or other restructuring . Our inability to achieve product cost reductions which offset customer-imposed price reductions could adversely affect our financial performance. Downward pricing pressure is customarily applied by automotive manufacturers to the automotive supply chain. Our customer contracts generally provide for annual price reductions over the production life of the vehicle, while requiring us to assume significant responsibility for the design, development and engineering of our products. Prices may also be adjusted on an ongoing basis to reflect changes in product content/costs and other commercial factors. Our inability to achieve product cost reductions that offset customer-imposed price reductions could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our inability to effectively manage the development, timing, quality and costs of new product launches could adversely affect our financial performance. Gentherm is developing and launching new products and related technologies for its battery performance solutions and electronic and software systems businesses, and intends to launch other new products in the future. The launch of products employing new technologies is a complex process, the success of which depends on a wide range of factors, including the robustness of our product and manufacturing process development, success in sourcing new components and commodities with suitable suppliers, readiness of our and our suppliers' manufacturing facilities and manufacturing processes, as well as factors related to tooling, equipment, employees, initial product quality and other factors. Given the complexity of new product launches, we may experience difficulties managing product quality, timeliness and associated costs. 17 In addition, new program launches require a significant ramp up of costs up to a few years prior to sales of such products . However, our sales related to these new programs generally are dependent upon the timing and success of our customers’ introduction of new vehicles. Our inability to effectively manage the timing, quality and costs of these new program launches could have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition . To the extent we are not able to successfully launch new business, vehicle production at our customers could be significantly delayed or shut down. Such operating failures could result in significant financial penalties to us or a diversion of personnel and financial resources to improving launches rather than investment in continuous process improvement or other growth initiatives, and could result in our customers shifting work away from us to a competitor. Any of the foregoing matters could result in a significant loss of revenue and market shares and could have an adverse effect on our profitability and cash flows. We use important intellectual property in our business. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if a third party makes assertions against us or our customers relating to intellectual property rights, our business could be adversely affected . We own important intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements. Our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in many of the markets that we serve. We cannot guarantee, however, that we will be able to secure all desired protection, nor that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate, to prevent infringement of our rights or misappropriation or theft of our technology, trade secrets or know-how. For example, effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some of the countries in which we operate. In addition, while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our trade secrets, know-how, business strategy and other proprietary information, such confidentiality agreements could be breached or otherwise may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and know-how related to the design, manufacture or operation of our products. If it became necessary for us to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights, any proceedings could be burdensome and costly, and we may not prevail. Further, adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise. Finally, for those products in our portfolio that rely on patent protection, once a patent has expired, the product is generally open to competition. Products under patent protection usually generate higher revenues and profitability than those not protected by patents. If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could suffer, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, our competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies or design around the patents we own or license. Further, as we expand our operations in jurisdictions where the protection of intellectual property rights is less robust, the risk of others duplicating our proprietary technologies increases, despite efforts we undertake to protect them. Foreign governments may adopt regulations, and foreign governments or courts may render decisions, requiring compulsory licensing of intellectual property rights, or foreign governments may require products to meet standards that serve to favor local companies or provide reduced protection relative to other countries. Our ability to market our products successfully depends on acceptance of our products by existing and potential customers and consumers, as well as the success of our customers. We have been, and will continue to be, required to educate potential customers and demonstrate that the merits of our existing products justify the costs associated with them. Similar efforts will be required with existing and potential customers for additional products we develop using technologies we develop or license. Customers will only include our products if there appears to be consumer demand. For our automotive products, we rely on OEMs and applicable dealer networks to market our products to consumers, and we do not have any control over the marketing budget or messaging nor the training of employees and agents regarding our products. Further, OEMs and dealer networks may market products offered by our competitors, including products manufactured by such OEMs. If customers or consumers conclude that temperature control seats or our other automotive products are unnecessary or too expensive or that our competitors offer more favorable sales terms or better products, OEMs and other manufacturers may reduce availability or decline to include our products in their vehicles. Adverse developments affecting one or more of our suppliers, or the suppliers of the OEMs and Tier 1s we supply, could harm our profitability and business reputation. Our supply chain may be adversely impacted by events outside of our control, including macro-economic events, trade restrictions, political crises, labor relations issues, liquidity constraints, natural or environmental occurrences or other factors noted 18 herein that can adversely affect us, which may adversely affect our operations and profitability. We operate a global supply chain that has been, and could in the future continue to be, disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in delays or inefficiencies in production. While we have been successful in mitigating these supply chain challenges, future component shortages could limit our production in the future. In addition, many of our products include TEDs, which contain certain raw materials that generally cannot be substituted. The prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions. Tellurium, a raw material used in TEDs, and other key raw materials include copper, silver and petroleum-based engineered plastics. If the market prices for these raw materials significantly increases, as they have in the past, our gross profit may be adversely impacted to the extent our suppliers pass those price increases on to us. If our suppliers fail to deliver products, parts, components and raw materials of sufficient quality and quantity and to our other stated written expectations on a timely basis, we could have difficulties meeting our production schedules, fulfilling our orders, sales and profits could decline, and our commercial reputation and customer relationships could be damaged. If we were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of our suppliers, particularly those who are sole sources, and could not procure the components from other sources, or necessary raw materials are not available due to supply chain disruption, we would be unable to meet our production schedules for some of our key products or to ship such products to our customers in a timely fashion which would adversely affect sales, margins and customer relations which could materially adverse effect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Unfavorable economic or industry conditions increases the risk of supply disruption. Security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology networks and systems, including a disruption related to cybersecurity, could interfere with our operations and could compromise the confidentiality of our proprietary information or personal information. We rely on our information technology systems and networks in connection with many of our business activities. Some of these networks and systems are managed by third-party service providers and are not under our direct control. Our operations routinely involve receiving, storing, processing and transmitting sensitive information pertaining to our business, customers, dealers, suppliers, employees and other sensitive matters. We rely upon the capacity, reliability and security of our IT and data security infrastructure, as well as our ability to expand and continually update this infrastructure in response to the changing needs of our business. If we experiences a problem with the functioning of an important IT system or a security breach of our IT systems, due to failure to timely upgrade systems or during system upgrades and/or new system implementations, or resulting from failures of our third-party service providers, the resulting disruptions could have an adverse effect on our business. As with most companies, we have experienced cyber-attacks, attempts to breach our systems and other similar incidents, none of which were material in 2020. Any future cyber incidents could, however, materially disrupt operational systems; result in loss of trade secrets or other proprietary or competitively sensitive information; compromise personally identifiable information regarding customers or employees; delay our ability to deliver products to customers; and jeopardize the security of our facilities. A cyber incident could be caused by malicious outsiders (including state-sponsored espionage or cyberwarfare) or insiders using sophisticated methods to circumvent firewalls, encryption and other security defenses. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Information technology security threats, including security breaches, computer malware, “ransomware” and other cyber-attacks, are increasing in both frequency and sophistication and could create financial liability, subject us to legal or regulatory sanctions or damage our reputation with customers, dealers, suppliers and other stakeholders. Many victims of ransomware are forced to pay significant ransoms to regain access to their critical business data. With some of our employees working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic, there may be increased opportunities for unauthorized access and cyber-attacks. Security breaches could also result in a violation of U.S. and international privacy and other laws and subject the Company to various litigations, investigations and proceedings. We continuously seek to maintain a robust program of information security and controls, but the impact of a material information technology event could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Despite our implementation of security measures, our IT systems, like those of other companies, are vulnerable to damages from computer viruses, natural disasters, unauthorized access, cyber-attack and other similar disruptions. No IT system can be fully secure and impervious to all threats or failures. Any system failure, accident or security breach could result in disruptions to our operations. A material network breach in the security of our IT systems could include the theft of our intellectual property, trade secrets, customer information, human resources information or other confidential information. To the extent that any disruptions or security breach results in a loss or damage to our data, or an inappropriate disclosure of confidential, proprietary or customer information, it could 19 cause significant damage to our reputation, affect our relationships with its customers, lead to claims against us, fines and other penalties assessed upon us by governmental authorities, and ultimately harm our business. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to remediate and protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future . Our business is subject to risks associated with manufacturing processes. If certain of our existing production facilities become incapable of manufacturing products for any reason, such as the extended work stoppages we experienced in the first half of 2020 as the pandemic spread and governmental authorities initiated “lock-down” orders for all non-essential activities, we may be unable to meet production requirements, sales and profits could decline, and our commercial reputation could be damaged. Without operation of certain existing production facilities, we may be limited in our ability to deliver products until we restore the manufacturing capability at the particular facility, find an alternative manufacturing facility or arrange an alternative source of supply. Furthermore, in November 2020, the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) was passed as a ballot measure. While many of the CPRA’s substantive modifications will not go into effect until 2023, they will require businesses to dedicate time and resources on compliance efforts, in some cases requiring new or modified practices and operations. We maintain property damage insurance that we believe to be adequate to provide for reconstruction of facilities and equipment, as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from any production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss. However, any recovery under our insurance policies may not offset the lost sales, harm to our business reputation or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations. Further, any such proceeds may be received and accounted for in a different reporting period, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow generally or for a specific reporting period. If we fail to manage our growth effectively or to integrate successfully any new or future business ventures, acquisitions or strategic alliance into our business, our business could be materially adversely harmed. We regularly consider opportunities to pursue business ventures, acquisitions, and strategic alliances that could leverage our products and capabilities, as well as, enhance our customer base, geographic penetration and scale, to complement our current businesses, some of which could be material. Finding and assessing a potential growth opportunity and completing a transaction involves extensive due diligence, management time and expense; however, the amount of information we can obtain about a potential growth opportunity may be limited. Further, we can give no assurance that new business ventures, acquisitions, and strategic alliances will positively affect our financial performance or will perform as planned, including regarding anticipated synergies. We may not be able to successfully assimilate or integrate companies that we acquire, including personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations, internal controls and general operating procedures. Further, for significant transactions, we would expect to incur additional debt, issue equity and/or increase capital expenditures, which may increase leverage risks, result in dilution or reduce capital available for other investments in ongoing operations. If we fail to assimilate or integrate acquired companies successfully, our business, reputation and results of operations could be materially impacted. Likewise, our failure to integrate and manage acquired companies successfully may lead to future impairment of any associated goodwill and intangible asset balances. Given our limited history in the patient temperature management business, the foregoing risks may be heightened due to our lack of experience in integrating similar businesses. Work stoppages, including those at our customers, and similar events could significantly disrupt our business. Because the automotive industry relies heavily on “just-in-time” delivery of components, a work stoppage at one or more of Gentherm's production facilities could have adverse effects on the business. Similarly, if one or more of our direct customers or an OEM were to experience a work stoppage, such as what occurred during the General Motors labor strike occurring in fall 2019 or the work stoppages that occurred in the first half of 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our customer would likely halt or limit purchases of our products, which could result in the temporary shutdown of the related Gentherm production facilities or other restructuring initiatives. Our global operations subject us to risks that may harm our operations and financial results. In 2020, 59% of our product revenue was generated from sales to customers outside the United States. We have significant personnel, property, equipment and operations in a number of countries outside of the United States, including Canada, China, Germany, Hungary, Macedonia, Mexico, Ukraine and Vietnam. Our exposure to the risks described below is substantial. We also derive a significant portion of revenues from Europe and Asia and conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies. 20 In addition to the general risks relating to our operations, our international operations are subject to unique risks inherent in doing business abroad, including: • exposure to local economic, political and labor conditions; • different and complex local laws and regulations and enforcement thereof, including those relating to governance, taxes, litigation, anti-corruption, employment, employee benefits, environmental, competition, permitting, investment, product regulations, repatriation, and export/import restrictions or requirements ; • increases in duties, tariffs and taxation on our products related to U.S. trade disputes; trade restrictions and potential trade wars, including limitation on imports or exports of components or assembled products, unilaterally or bilaterally; • exposure to infectious disease and epidemics, including the effects on our business operations, and those of our customers and suppliers, in geographic locations impacted by an outbreak, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; • violence and civil unrest (including acts of terrorism, drug-cartel related and other forms of violence and outbreaks of war); • expropriation, nationalization or other protectionist activities; • currency exchange rate fluctuations and currency controls; in particular, a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, including the Euro, the Chinese Renminbi, the Vietnamese Dong, the Hungarian Forint, the Macedonian Denar, the Ukrainian Hryvnia and the Mexican Peso; • local business and cultural factors that differ from our customary standards and practices, including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in due to anti-corruption laws and regulations; and • ineffective legal protection of our intellectual property rights in certain countries. Additionally, our primary manufacturing locations are in Mexico, China, Vietnam, Macedonia and Ukraine, all countries that have historically experienced a heightened degree of political, civil and labor uncertainty. Political conflict and related demonstrations and violence in Ukraine in recent years, for example, highlights the risks to our foreign manufacturing facilities. Although our manufacturing facility in Ukraine is located approximately 700 miles by road from Kiev, and approximately the same distance from the activities along the border of Ukraine and Russia where fighting has occurred, we cannot be certain that similar demonstrations, unrest and international tensions will not affect our facility in the future, including due to electrical outages and periodic battles with separatists closer to our facility. In addition, certain of our employees in Ukraine are routinely conscripted into the military and/or sent to the Russian border to fight in the ongoing conflict. Furthermore, most of our products manufactured in Ukraine are shipped across the border from Ukraine to Hungary for further delivery to our customers. If that border crossing were to be closed or restricted for any reason, we would essentially experience a loss of the use of our Ukrainian facility, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. Defects or quality issues associated with our medical products could adversely affect the results of our operations. Our design, manufacture and marketing of automotive products may subject us to warranty claims and product liability in the event that our products fail to perform as expected and, in the case of product liability, such failure of our products results or is alleged to result in bodily injury or property damage. Any large product liability claims, if made, could exceed our insurance coverage limits and insurance may not continue to be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all, and we may incur significant costs to defend these claims. If any of our products are or are alleged to be defective, we also may be required to participate in a recall or other corrective action involving such products. Automotive manufacturers are increasingly looking to their suppliers for contribution when faced with recalls and product liability claims, as well as requiring their suppliers to guarantee or warrant their products and bear the costs of repair and replacement of such products under new vehicle warranties. OEMs historically have recalled vehicles for perceived defects in seat heaters, and we have incurred liabilities in connection with the recalls and other field actions. In addition, governmental regulatory agencies throughout the world, such as NHTSA in the U.S., have safety standards that require manufacturers to remedy defects related to vehicle safety through safety recall campaigns, and a manufacturer is obligated to recall vehicles if it determines that the vehicles do not comply with a safety standard. A recall claim brought against us that is not insured, or a product liability claim brought against us in excess of our available insurance, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and reputation or market acceptance of our products. In certain instances, allegedly defective products may be the result of components supplied by our supply chain, and we may be limited in our ability to obtain recovery from our suppliers of materials or services 21 included within our products that are associated with product liability and warranty claims, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production . The design, manufacture and marketing of medical products involve certain inherent risks. Manufacturing or design defects, component failures, unapproved or improper use of our products, or inadequate disclosure of risks or other information relating to the use of our products can lead to regulatory action, injury or other serious adverse events. These events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products (either voluntary or as required by the FDA or similar governmental authorities in other countries), and could result, in certain cases, in the removal of a product from the market. A recall, inadequate disclosure or defect could result in significant costs and lost sales and customers, enforcement actions and/or investigations by state and federal governments or other enforcement bodies, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce future demand for our products. Personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in significant product liability claims being brought against us. In some circumstances, such adverse events could also cause delays in regulatory approval of new products or the imposition of post-market approval requirements, such as further clinical testing. Such clinical testing is costly and time-consuming and could delay market approval or the meeting of additional post-market requirements. Legal, Regulatory and Compliance Risks Changes to trade policy, including tariffs and customs regulations, could have a material and adverse effect on our business. Existing free trade laws and regulations, such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, provide certain duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports, subject to compliance with the applicable classification and other requirements. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products, such as China and Mexico, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results. For instance, beginning in 2018, the U.S. and Chinese governments have imposed a series of significant incremental retaliatory tariffs to certain imported products. Most notably with respect to the automotive industry, the U.S. imposed tariffs on imports of certain steel, aluminum and automotive components, and China imposed retaliatory tariffs on imports of U.S. vehicles and certain automotive components. Depending upon their duration and implementation, as well as our ability to mitigate their impact, these tariffs and other regulatory actions could materially affect our business, including in the form of increase cost of goods sold, decreased margins, increased pricing for customers, and reduced sales. Tax matters, including changes in the corporate tax rates, disagreement with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could impact our results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and our operations, plans and results are affected by tax legislation and other initiatives. We are also subject to regular reviews, examinations, and audits by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities with respect to our taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken, we could face additional tax liability, including interest and penalties. There can be no assurance that payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes will not have a material impact on our result of operations and financial position. We also need to comply with new, evolving or revised tax laws and regulations, more of which may arise as the United States government shifts to a new administration in 2021. The enactment of or increases in tariffs, or other changes in the application or interpretation of tax legislation and other initiatives, or on specific products that we sell or with which our products compete, may have an adverse effect on our business or on our results of operations. The value of our deferred tax assets may not be realized, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results . As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $72 million in net deferred tax assets. These deferred tax assets include net operating loss carryovers and tax credits that can be used to offset taxable income in future periods and reduce income taxes payable in those future periods. Each quarter, we determine the probability of the realization of deferred tax assets, using significant judgments and estimates with respect to, among other things, historical operating results and expectations of future earnings and tax planning strategies. If we determine in the future that there is not sufficient positive evidence to support the valuation of these assets, due to the risk factors described herein or other factors, we may be required to further adjust the valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets. Such a reduction could result in material non-cash expenses in the period in which the valuation allowance is adjusted and could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements. 22 Our patient temperature management business is subject to extensive industry regulation and failure to comply with all applicable rules and regulation may adversely impact us. Our patient temperature management products are subject to extensive, complex, costly and evolving government regulation. In the United States, this is principally administered by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). Various regulatory agencies in foreign countries where our medical products are sold also regulate that business. Under both United States and foreign country regulations, we are subject to periodic inspection of our facilities (including third-party facilities that are performing services for us), procedures and operations and testing of our products. Following such FDA inspections, should any noncompliance with regulations or other quality issues be noted, we may receive observations, notices, citations and/or warning letters that could require us to get FDA approval of a corrective action plan and modify certain activities identified during the inspection, possibly at a significant cost. We are also required to report adverse events associated with our medical products to the FDA and other foreign regulatory authorities where our products have been approved or received market clearance. Unexpected or serious health or safety concerns could result in liability claims, recalls, market withdrawals or other regulatory actions. Changes in laws or regulations could require us to change the way we operate or to utilize resources to maintain compliance, which could increase costs or otherwise disrupt operations. In addition, failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations could result in fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses or, in rare circumstances, market withdrawal of the product. The process for obtaining governmental approval to manufacture and market new medical devices is time-consuming and costly. We are dependent on receiving FDA and other governmental or third-party approvals prior to manufacturing, marketing and shipping any new medical products. We cannot be certain that any new medical products we develop will receive FDA or other necessary approvals. Also receipt of approval in one country does not guarantee approval by the FDA or any other foreign regulatory agency. Any failure to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations could have a material and adverse effect on our reputation, business and financial results. Our operations outside of the United States require us to comply with various anti-bribery and anti-corruption regulations, including but not limited to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act and the China Anti-Unfair Competition Law. Violations of these laws, which are complex and often difficult to interpret and apply, could result in significant criminal penalties or sanctions that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. A significant product liability lawsuit, warranty claim or product recall involving us or one of our major customers, or an investigation regarding vehicle safety generally, could materially and adversely affect our financial performance. In the event that our products fail to perform as expected, whether allegedly due to our fault or that of one of our suppliers, and such failure results in, or is alleged to result in, bodily injury and/or property damage or other losses, we may be subject to product liability lawsuits and other claims, and we have been in the past and may again be required or requested by our customers or regulators to participate in a recall or other corrective action involving such products. We also are a party to agreements with certain of our customers, whereby these customers may pursue claims against us for contribution of all or a portion of the amounts sought in connection with product liability and warranty claims. We carry insurance for certain product liability claims, and have utilized such insurance periodically. However, such coverage may be limited for future claims. In addition, we may not be successful in recovering amounts from third parties, including suppliers, in connection with these claims. These types of claims could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. We are involved from time to time in various legal and regulatory proceedings and claims, which could adversely affect our financial performance. We are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings and claims that, from time to time, are significant. These are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business including, without limitation, commercial or contractual disputes, including disputes with our customers, suppliers or competitors, intellectual property matters, personal injury claims, environmental matters, tax matters and employment matters. Such legal and regulatory proceedings could result in an adverse outcome for the Company that would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 23 Our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely impacted from a decrease in or cessation or clawback of government incentives related to investments , workforce or production . We have received, and may receive economic benefits from national, state and local governments in various regions of the world in the form of incentives designed to encourage manufacturers to establish, maintain or increase investment, workforce or production. These incentives may take various forms, including grants, loan subsidies and tax abatements or credits. The impact of these incentives can be significant in a particular market during a reporting period. A decrease in, expiration without renewal of, or other cessation or clawback of government incentives for any of our business units, as a result of administrative decision or otherwise, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition, as well as our ability to fund new investments. We are required to comply with environmental laws and regulations that could cause us to incur significant costs. Our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect the environment, and we expect that additional requirements with respect to environmental matters will be imposed on us in the future. We may also assume, or be deemed to assume, significant environmental liabilities in acquisitions. Environmental liability may be imposed without regard to fault, and under certain circumstances, can be joint and several, resulting in one party being held responsible for the entire obligation. Material future expenditures may be necessary if compliance standards change or material unknown conditions that require remediation are discovered. No assurance can be given that all environmental liabilities have been identified or that no prior owner or operator of our properties or former properties has created an environmental condition not known to us. Environmental laws could also restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses in connection with our business. Violations of these requirements could result in fines or sanctions, obligations to investigate or remediate contamination, third party property damage or personal injury claims due to the migration of contaminants off-site, or modification or revocation of our operating permits, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, proposed and existing efforts to address climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions could directly or indirectly affect our costs of energy, materials, manufacturing, distribution, packaging and other operating costs, which could impact our business and financial results. We may face particular privacy, data security and data protection risks. Legislators and/or regulators in countries in which we operate are increasingly adopting or revising privacy, information security and data protection laws. In particular, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective on May 25, 2018, imposes additional obligations and risk upon our business and which increases substantially the penalties to which we could be subject in the event of any non-compliance. The GDPR and other similar laws and regulations, including the new California Consumer Protection Act (“CCPA”) and other similar state laws recently or soon to be enacted, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions, may be costly to comply with, result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, and subject us to remedies that may harm our business, including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices. Furthermore, the CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020 and many of its requirements have not yet been interpreted by courts, and best practices are still being developed by the industry, all of which increase the risk of compliance failure and related adverse impacts. Any failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures may affect our ability to accurately report our financial results, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, fail to prevent fraud and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we must maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, which requires significant resources and management oversight. Effectiveness of such controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, effectively prevent fraud and to operate successfully as a public company. Our management determined we had a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, which we determined was remediated as of September 30, 2019. Any future failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, or timely effect any necessary improvement of such controls, could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, which could subject us to adverse regulatory consequences. Ineffectiveness of such controls also could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock. 24 Financial Risks We are subject to significant foreign currency risk and foreign exchange exposure related to our global operations. A significant portion of our global transactions is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. While we sometimes employ financial instruments to hedge some of our transactional foreign exchange exposure, developing an effective and economical foreign currency risk strategy is complex and expensive and no strategy can completely insulate us from those exposures. Exchange rates can be volatile and could adversely affect our financial results and comparability of results from period to period. We may be unable to realize the expected benefits of our restructuring actions, which could adversely affect our profitability and operations. We have undertaken significant restructuring activities in recent years that remain ongoing, and may take future restructuring actions to realign and resize our production capacity and cost structure, lower our cost base, improve our financial performance and cash flow generation, and create a simplified organization best positioned to deliver on our key financial and operational priorities. Charges related to these actions or any further restructuring actions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We cannot ensure that any current or future restructuring will be completed as planned, on a timely basis or at all, will be on budget, or achieve the desired results. Our existing indebtedness and the inability to access capital markets could restrict our business activities or our ability to execute our strategic objectives or adversely affect our financial performance. As of December 31, 2020, our total consolidated indebtedness was $192.4 million. We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. This significant amount of debt could have important, adverse consequences to us and our investors, including: • requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest payments; • making it more difficult to satisfy other obligations; • increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; • reducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow our businesses; • limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and industries; and • limiting our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise; Our debt agreements contain certain restrictive covenants and customary events of default. These restrictive covenants limit our ability to take certain actions, such as, among other things: incur additional debt, make certain payments or distributions (including for the repurchase or redemption of our shares), engage in mergers or consolidations, make certain dispositions and transfers of assets, enter into transactions with affiliates and guarantee indebtedness. While not unusual for financings of the type that we have, the restrictions in our credit facilities may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and may make it difficult for us to execute our business plans, take advantage of business opportunities, or react to changing industry conditions. To the extent that we incur additional indebtedness, the risks described above could increase. In addition, our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. Our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to service our outstanding debt or to repay the outstanding debt as it becomes due, and we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to service or refinance our debt. If an event of default would occur under our existing debt agreements or any additional indebtedness, our lenders could declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable, which may cause cross-defaults under our other debt obligations. If our lenders accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness, we may not have sufficient capital available at that time to pay the amounts due to all lenders on a timely basis, and there is no guarantee that we would be able to repay, refinance, or restructure the payments on such debt. Further, under our existing credit facilities, the lenders would have the right to foreclose on certain of our assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition . 25 An adverse change in the interest rates for our borrowings could adversely affect our financial condition . Our current outstanding variable rate indebtedness uses LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. The ICE Benchmark Administration, which administers LIBOR, has announced that certain tenors of U.S. Dollar LIBOR will cease at the end of 2021, and the remaining tenors of U.S. Dollar LIBOR will cease at the end of June of 2023 for loans originated prior to the end of 2021. The Alternative Reference Rate Committee, which was convened by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 2014 to identify alternative reference rates for U.S. Dollar LIBOR, has selected variations of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) to replace LIBOR. Our Amended Credit Agreement utilizes LIBOR as a benchmark for calculating the applicable interest rate, and the obligations under our Amended Credit Agreement mature after the expected cessation of LIBOR. Under the terms of our Amended Credit Agreement, the cessation of LIBOR or the announcement by the administrator of LIBOR or a governmental authority with jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent would require us to renegotiate or amend this agreement to select a replacement benchmark, which may adversely affect interest rates and result in higher borrowing costs. This could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. We cannot predict the effect of the potential changes to or elimination of LIBOR or the establishment and use of alternative rates or benchmarks and the corresponding effects on our cost of capital. Common Stock Investment Risks The price of our Common Stock may fluctuate significantly. The price of our Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market has experienced substantial price volatility in the past, including in 2020 as a result of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the automotive industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced significant stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance. Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, share repurchases or other market expectations, its stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention. On December 11, 2020, the Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program, pursuant to which the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $150 million of common stock over a three-year period. Repurchases may be made, from time to time, in amounts and at prices the Company deems appropriate, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, debt covenants and other considerations. Any Company stock repurchases under the program may result in stock price and volume fluctuations. I TEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. I TEM 2.

MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT’S COMMON STOCK, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Market Information Our Common Stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “THRM.” Holders As of February 24, 2021, our Common Stock was held by 42 shareholders of record. A substantially greater number of holders are beneficial owners whose shares of record are held by banks, brokers and other nominees. Dividends We have not paid any Common Stock cash dividends since formation and we do not expect to pay any in the foreseeable future. The payment of future dividends is within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon business conditions, our earnings and financial condition and other factors. Currently, our bank credit facilities limit payment of dividends on our Common Stock. Stock Repurchase Program In December 2016, the Board of Directors authorized a three-year, $100 million stock repurchase program. In June 2018, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the stock repurchase plan to $300 million and extended the stock repurchase plan until December 15, 2020. Such stock repurchase program had $74.2 million of repurchase authorization remaining at expiration. On December 11, 2020, the Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program (the “2020 Stock Repurchase Program”) to commence upon expiration of the prior stock repurchase program on December 15, 2020. Under the 2020 Stock Repurchase Program, the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $150 million of its issued and outstanding common stock over a three-year period, expiring December 15, 2023. Repurchases under the 2020 Stock Repurchase Program may be made, from time to time, in amounts and at prices the Company deems appropriate, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, debt covenants and other considerations. Any such repurchases may be executed using open market purchases, privately negotiated agreements or other transactions, and may be funded from cash on hand, available borrowings or proceeds from potential debt or other capital markets sources. The 2020 Stock Repurchase Program may be modified, extended or terminated at any time without prior notice. 27 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities During Fourth Quarter 2020 Period (a) Total Number of Shares Purchased (b) Average Price Paid Per Share (c) Total Number of Shares Repurchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs (d) Approximate Dollar Value of Shares That May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (1) October 1, 2020 to October 31, 2020 — $ — — 74,225,938 November 1, 2020 to November 30, 2020 — $ — — 74,225,938 December 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020 — $ — — 150,000,000 (1) The existing stock repurchase program expired on December 15, 2020.

SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA Not applicable. 29 I TEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, our consolidated financial statements (and notes related thereto) and other more detailed financial information appearing elsewhere in this Report. Further, you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this Report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. See also “Forward-Looking Statements” in Part I of this Report. Overview Gentherm Incorporated is a global developer and marketer of innovative thermal management technologies for a broad range of heating and cooling and temperature control applications. Our products provide solutions for automotive passenger climate comfort and convenience, battery thermal management and cell connecting systems, as well as patient temperature management within the health care industry. Our automotive products can be found on the vehicles of nearly all major automotive manufacturers operating in North America and Europe and several major auto manufacturers in Asia. We operate in locations aligned with our major customers’ product strategies to provide locally enhanced design, integration and production capabilities. The Company is also developing a number of new technologies and products that are expected to help enable improvements to existing products and to create new product applications for existing and new markets. Our sales are driven by the number of vehicles produced by the automotive manufacturers, which is ultimately dependent on consumer demand for automotive vehicles, and our content per vehicle. Historically, new vehicle demand has been driven by macro-economic and other factors, such as interest rates, manufacturer and dealer sales incentives, fuel prices, consumer confidence, employment levels, income growth trends and government and tax incentives. Economic volatility or weakness, as well as geopolitical factors, in North America, Europe or Asia, could result in a significant reduction in automotive sales and production by our customers, which would have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition, as we experienced in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as described below. While our diversified automotive OEM customer base and geographic revenue base, along with our flexible cost structure, have well positioned us to withstand the impact of industry downturns, including the current impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and benefit from industry upturns in the ordinary course, shifts in the mix of global automotive production to higher cost regions or to vehicles with less content could adversely impact our profitability. In addition, we may be adversely impacted by volatility, weakness or slow growth in markets for hybrid electric vehicles specifically. Recent Trends General Economic Condition The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted global economic activity, including the automotive market. The COVID-19 pandemic was first identified in China around December 2019. The impact of the outbreak quickly expanded beyond China and its surrounding region and has significantly and adversely impacted the entire global economy and automotive market in 2020. During the first quarter of 2020, customer plants in North America and Europe were closed beginning in the second half of March due to the pandemic. This resulted in temporary, partial closures of several of our manufacturing facilities in North America and Europe by the end of March 2020. Customer plants and our manufacturing facilities in Asia were closed for several weeks in February and operated at reduced volumes in March, resuming production to near full capacity by the end of the first quarter, which continued throughout the remainder of the year. However, during the second quarter of 2020, our manufacturing facilities in North America and Europe remained closed until the last week in May due to the pandemic, gradually resuming production to near full capacity in North America, and to about 70% capacity in Europe by the end of June. During the second half of 2020, our customers’ plants were open, and our production volumes were stronger than pre-COVID levels at our manufacturing facilities. The Company has implemented additional health and safety precautions and protocols in response to the pandemic and government guidelines to help ensure the safety and health of all its employees, and it continues to assess and update business continuity plans in the context of this pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic significantly adversely affected our operations, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and stock price in the first half of 2020. The second half of 2020 recovered with increased production from the first half of the year. However, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on global automotive markets in 2021, in the form of supply chain and production disruptions, workforce restrictions, travel restrictions and reduced consumer spending, among other factors. There remains substantial uncertainty regarding the global economic impact of, and the speed and shape of the recovery from, 30 the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, including for the global automotive industry and the resulting impact on our future operations and financial results . Light Vehicle Production Volumes Our sales are driven by the number of vehicles produced by the automotive manufacturers, which is ultimately dependent on consumer demand for automotive vehicles, and our content per vehicle. According to the forecasting firm IHS Markit (February 2021 release), global light vehicle production in 2020 in the Company’s key markets of North America, Europe, China, Japan and Korea, as compared to 2019, are shown below (in millions of units): 2020 2019 % Change North America 13.0 16.3 (20.2 )% Europe 16.6 21.2 (21.7 )% Greater China 23.6 24.7 (4.5 )% Japan / South Korea 11.2 13.1 (14.5 )% Total light vehicle production volume in key markets 64.4 75.3 (14.4 )% The IHS Markit (February 2021 release) forecasted light vehicle production volume in the Company’s key markets for full year 2021 to increase to 72.2 million units, a 12.1% increase from full year 2020 light vehicle production volumes. Forecasted light vehicle production volumes are a component of the data we use in forecasting future business. However, these forecasts generally are updated monthly, and future forecasts may be significantly different from period to period due to changes in macroeconomic conditions or matters specific to the automotive industry, such as the fluctuations that occurred in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, due to differences in regional product mix at our manufacturing facilities, as well as releases from customers on specific vehicle programs, our future forecasted results do not directly correlate with the global and/or regional light vehicle production forecasts of IHS Markit or other third-party sources. Liquidity and Capital Resources In light of the substantial economic and financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to date, the Company took significant actions in 2020 to address its liquidity position. In March 2020, the Company borrowed an additional $169.5 million under its revolving credit facility to increase its cash position and provide additional financial flexibility. After the drawdown in March 2020, and through December 31, 2020, the Company repaid a net amount of $41.2 million of the amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, inclusive of the net new borrowings, $186.2 million was outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement. In January 2021, the Company repaid an additional $80.0 million of the amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement. In addition, the Company has been prudently addressing its day-to-day operations, including reducing expenses, inventory levels and capital spending, and had deferred a portion of 2020 base salaries generally for all salaried employees. The Company terminated the salary deferral earlier than planned on September 30, 2020 due to the improved market and financial conditions. Based upon consolidated EBITDA for the trailing twelve months calculated for purposes of the Consolidated Leverage Ratio, $288.8 million remained available as of December 31, 2020 for additional borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement subject to specified conditions that Gentherm currently satisfies. See “—Liquidity and Capital Resources” below for additional information. 31 New Business Awards We believe that innovation is an important element to gaining market acceptance of our products and strengthening our market position. During 2020, we secured an estimated $940 million of automotive new business awards. Automotive new business awards represent the aggregate projected lifetime revenue of new awards provided by customers to Gentherm in the applicable period, with the value based on the price and volume projections received from each customer as of the award date. Although automotive new business awards are not firm customer orders, we believe that new business awards are an indicator of future revenue. New business awards are not projections of revenue or future business as of December 31, 2020, the date of this Report or any other date. Customer projections regularly change over time and we do not update our calculation of any new business award after the date initially communicated. Automotive new business awards in 2020 were adversely impacted by the macroeconomic changes and related uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, but also may not convert into future customer orders similar to historical periods due to the future impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Revenues resulting from automotive new business awards also are subject to additional risks and uncertainties as described under “Forward-Looking Statements” in Item 1 of this Report. Stock Repurchase Program In December 2016, the Board of Directors authorized a three-year, $100.0 million stock repurchase program. In June 2018, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the stock repurchase plan to $300.0 million and extended the stock repurchase plan until December 15, 2020. In 2020, we repurchased approximately $9.1 million of shares under this plan. The repurchase authorization remaining at expiration was $74.2 million. On December 11, 2020, the Board of Directors authorized the 2020 Stock Repurchase Program to commence upon expiration of the prior stock repurchase program on December 15, 2020. Under the 2020 Stock Repurchase Program, the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $150 million of its issued and outstanding common stock over a three-year period, expiring December 15, 2023. In 2020, no shares were repurchased under the 2020 Stock Repurchase Program. For further information related to our stock repurchase program, see Item 5, ""Market for the Company’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities,"" and Note 15, ""Equity"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report. Restructuring Manufacturing Footprint Rationalization On September 23, 2019, the Company committed to a restructuring plan to improve the Company’s manufacturing productivity and rationalize its footprint. Under this plan, the Company will relocate and consolidate certain existing automotive manufacturing and, as a result, reduce the number of plants by two. On March 20, 2020, the Company announced the initial phase of this restructuring plan, which includes the consolidation of all North American electronics manufacturing to Celaya, Mexico. This will result in the closure of the Burlington, Canada facility, and the transfer of electronics manufacturing from Acuña, Mexico. The closure of the Burlington, Canada facility is expected to be completed mid-year 2021. During the second quarter of 2020, due to circumstances arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, management adjusted the plan to proactively manage its cash position. Adjustments to the plan have resulted in changes to the estimated number of employee separations and total costs to execute the plan. On December 10, 2020, the Company announced the consolidation of our electronics manufacturing in Asia to Bantian, Shenzhen, China, which will result in the closure of our Longgang, Shenzhen, China facility that is expected to be completed by the end of 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized restructuring expense of $(0.8) million for employee separation costs, $0.7 million for accelerated depreciation and $0.3 million for other costs. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized restructuring expense of $4.9 million for employee separation costs, and $2.1 million of accelerated depreciation and fixed asset impairment. The Company has recorded approximately $7.1 million of restructuring expenses since the inception of this program. Under the revised restructuring plan, the Company expects to incur total costs of between $16 million and $19 million, of which between $13 million and $16 million are expected to be cash expenditures. The total expected costs include employee separation costs of between $6.5 million and $7.5 million, capital expenditures of between $3.5 million and $4.5 million and non-cash expenses for accelerated depreciation and impairment of fixed assets of approximately $3 million. The Company also expects to incur other transition costs including recruiting, relocation, and machinery and equipment move and set up costs of between $3 million and $4 million. The actions under this plan are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2021. The actual timing, costs and savings of the plan may differ materially from the Company’s current expectations and estimates. 32 GPT and CSZ-IC Restructuring During 2019, the Company completed its plan to eliminate non-core areas of investment through the divestitures of Cincinnati Sub-Zero industrial chamber business (“CSZ-IC”) and Gentherm Global Power Technologies (“GPT”). Costs directly associated with the divestiture process were classified as Restructuring expense. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized $0.3 million of employee separation costs and $1.0 million of other related costs. Other Restructuring Activities As part of the Company’s continued efforts to optimize its cost structure, the Company has undertaken several discrete restructuring actions. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized $5.4 million and $2.9 million of employee separation costs, respectively, and $0.2 million and $1.4 million of other related costs, respectively. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized $0.4 million of asset impairment loss. These restructuring expenses were primarily associated with restructuring actions focused on optimizing our manufacturing and engineering footprint and the reduction of global overhead costs. The Company will continue to explore opportunities to improve its future profitability and competitiveness. These actions may result in the recognition of additional restructuring charges that could be material. See Note 5, “Restructuring”, to our consolidated financial statements included in this Report for information about our restructuring activities. Divestitures Divestiture of CSZ-IC On February 1, 2019, the Company completed the divestiture of CSZ-IC and the former Cincinnati Sub-Zero headquarters facility to Weiss Technik North America, Inc. for total cash proceeds of $47.5 million, including $2.5 million of cash proceeds placed into an escrow account for a period of up to one year as partial security for the Company’s obligations under the sale agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company resolved its remaining obligations under the sale agreement, and the amounts in escrow were released net of settlement for obligations under the sale agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized a $4.3 million gain on sale, which is classified in Net loss on divestitures within the consolidated statements of income. Divestiture of GPT On October 1, 2019, the Company completed the divesture of GPT for a nominal amount. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized asset impairments and loss on sale totaling $27.1 million, consisting of $16.8 million of impairment on assets held for sale, $4.5 million related to impairment of an equity investment that met held for sale criteria during 2019 and $5.8 million of loss on sale, which includes $4.0 million related to the release of previously deferred foreign currency translation losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and $1.5 million related to a loan to the buyer that was considered uncollectible. These impairment charges and loss on sale are classified in Impairment loss within the consolidated statements of income. Acquisitions Acquisition of Stihler Electronic GmbH (“Stihler”) On April 1, 2019, Gentherm acquired Stihler, a leading developer and manufacturer of patient and blood temperature management systems, for a purchase price of $15.5 million, net of cash acquired and including $0.7 million of contingent consideration to be paid upon achievement of a milestone that was completed in September 2020, and paid in the fourth quarter of 2020. In addition, the purchase agreement included a contingent payment of $0.7 million to be paid if the selling shareholder remains employed by Stihler through December 2020. This was completed and the payment was recorded as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses ratably over the service period. The results of operations of Stihler are reported within the Company’s Medical segment from the date of acquisition. Reportable Segments The Company has two reportable segments for financial reporting purposes: Automotive and Medical. In 2018 and 2019, our Industrial reporting segment represented the combined results from our patient temperature management systems business (“Medical”), GPT (through its divestiture on October 1, 2019), CSZ-IC (through its divestiture on February 1, 2019) and non-automotive expenses from our advanced research and development division (through December 31, 2019). The operating 33 results from these businesses and division previously were presented together as one reporting segment because of their historical joint concentration on identifying new markets and product applications based on thermal management technologies. In 2020, the Industrial reporting segment was renamed the Medical reporting segment to reflect the patient temperature management business as the focus and strategic direction of this segment. Also, during 2020, the advanced research and development costs not associated with the Medical segment were moved to the Automotive segment, as this organization primarily supports the Automotive related research and development activities following the divestitures of GPT and CSZ-IC. See Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our reportable segments as well as their proportional contribution to the Company’s reported product revenues and operating income. The financial information used by our chief operating decision maker to assess operating performance and allocate resources is based on these reportable segments. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2019 This section discusses our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2020 versus 2019.

Product Revenues Below is a summary of our Product revenues, in thousands, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019: Year Ended December 31, Variance Due To: 2020 2019 Favorable / (Unfavorable) Automotive Volume FX Pricing/Other Total Product revenues $ 913,098 $ 971,684 $ (58,586 ) $ (38,219 ) $ 7,130 $ (27,497 ) $ (58,586 ) Product revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased 6.0% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in product revenues is due to unfavorable volumes in our Automotive segment, partially offset by favorable foreign currency impacts, primarily related to the Euro, Chinese Renminbi and Korean Won. The decrease in product revenues included in Variance Due To Pricing/Other above is primarily attributable to the divestitures of CSZ-IC on February 1, 2019 and GPT on October 1, 2019, as well as decreases in customer pricing, partially offset by the acquisition of Stihler on April 1, 2019 and an increase in product revenue in our Medical segment. Cost of Sales Below is a summary of our Cost of sales and Gross margin, in thousands, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019: Year Ended December 31, Variance Due To: 2020 2019 Favorable / (Unfavorable) Automotive Volume Operational Performance FX Other Total Cost of sales $ 644,994 $ 683,349 $ 38,355 $ 12,236 $ 14,711 $ 860 $ 10,548 $ 38,355 Gross margin 268,104 288,335 (20,231 ) $ (25,983 ) $ 14,711 $ 7,990 $ (16,949 ) $ (20,231 ) Gross margin - Percentage of product revenues 29.4 % 29.7 % Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased 5.6% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in cost of sales is due to volumes decreases in our Automotive segment, operational performance improvements, and favorable foreign currency impacts, primarily attributable to the Mexican Peso and Ukrainian Hryvnia. The operational performance improvements are primarily attributable to a decrease in material costs, an increase in manufacturing productivity, fixed cost savings and, partially offset by increases in freight costs. The decrease in cost of sales is also due to the following items included in Variance Due To Other above: ▪ $10.2 million decrease attributable to divested businesses (CSZ-IC and GPT); 35 ▪ $2.7 million decrease due to various government subsidy programs globally; and ▪ $2.8 million increase attributable to Medical, including impact of the acquisition of Stihler on April 1, 2019. Net Research and Development Expenses Below is a summary of our Net research and development expenses, in thousands, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 Favorable / (Unfavorable) Research and development expenses $ 81,968 $ 91,033 $ 9,065 Reimbursed research and development expenses (13,928 ) (18,557 ) (4,629 ) Net research and development expenses $ 68,040 $ 72,476 $ 4,436 Percentage of product revenues 7.5 % 7.5 % Net research and development expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased 6.1% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in net research and development expenses is primarily related to reduced project-related spending due to cost reduction initiatives, partially offset by lower reimbursements for project-related spending. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Below is a summary of our Selling, general and administrative expenses, in thousands, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 Favorable / (Unfavorable) Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 105,044 $ 118,680 $ 13,636 Percentage of product revenues 11.5 % 12.2 % Selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 decreased 11.5% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses is primarily related to the impacts of divested businesses (CSZ-IC and GPT), the absence of CFO transition costs in 2020, as well as the impact of cost reduction initiatives and a reduction in travel expenses, partially offset by mark to market adjustments in cash settled stock appreciation rights. Restructuring Expenses Below is a summary of our Restructuring expenses, in thousands, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 Favorable / (Unfavorable) Restructuring expenses $ 5,803 $ 12,919 $ 7,116 Restructuring expenses primarily relate to the Manufacturing Footprint Rationalization restructuring program and other discrete restructuring activities focused on optimizing our manufacturing and engineering footprint and the reduction of global overhead expenses.

See Note 7, “Goodwill and Other Intangibles” of the consolidated financial statements included in this Report for additional information. Income Tax Expense Below is a summary of our Income tax expense, in thousands, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 Favorable / (Unfavorable) Income tax expense $ 21,866 $ 10,285 $ (11,581 ) Income tax expense was $21.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, on earnings before income tax of $81.6 million, representing an effective tax rate of 26.8%. The tax amount included the effect of the settlement and closure of multi-year international tax audits of $3.4 million. Adjusted for the audit impacts, the effective tax rate was 22.6%. The effective tax rate differed from the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the international provisions of the U.S. tax reform, such as global intangible low-tax income (“GILTI”). Income tax expense was $10.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, on earnings before income tax of $59.2 million, representing an effective tax rate of 17.4%. The pre-tax earnings amount included the non-deductible impairment loss of $27.1 million. Adjusted for the impairment loss, the effective tax rate was 11.9% for 2019. The effective tax rate differed from the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to (1) the international provisions of the U.S. tax reform, such as GILTI and higher tax rate jurisdictions and (2) the revised valuation of certain deferred income tax assets. 38 Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash and Cash Flows The Company historically has funded its liquidity needs primarily through cash flows from operating activities and borrowings under its Amended Credit Agreement, as well as equity and other debt financings on a more limited basis. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, we were focused on a capital allocation strategy within our strategic plan that included a targeted debt-to-earnings leverage ratio and using a portion of our cash flow for Common Stock repurchases. In light of the significant economic uncertainty and financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company took significant actions to address its liquidity. First, the Company has been prudently addressing its day-to-day operations, including reducing expenses, inventory levels and capital spending. In addition, effective May 1, 2020, the Company implemented base salary deferrals until September 30, 2020, including a 30-40% deferral among executives and a 20% deferral for other salaried employees, to control expenses and conserve cash, which deferral the Company terminated earlier than planned on September 30, 2020 due to the improved market and financial conditions. The Company also revised its non-employee director compensation program for directors elected at the 2020 annual meeting of shareholders, with all compensation being paid in restricted stock for one year. Also, in March 2020, the Company increased its borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement by $169.5 million as a safeguard to increase its cash position and provide additional financial flexibility. The proceeds were used for working capital and for other general corporate purposes permitted by the Amended Credit Agreement. After the drawdown in March 2020 and through December 31, 2020, the Company repaid a net amount of $41.2 million of the amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, inclusive of the net new borrowings, $186.2 million was outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement. In January 2021, the Company repaid an additional $80.0 million of the amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement. Borrowing availability is subject to, among other things, the Company’s compliance with the minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio and Consolidated Leverage Ratio as of the end of any fiscal quarter. Based upon consolidated EBITDA for the trailing twelve months calculated for purposes of the Consolidated Leverage Ratio, $288.8 million remained available as of December 31, 2020 for additional borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement subject to specified conditions that Gentherm currently satisfies. Further, the Company suspended its stock repurchase program in the first quarter of 2020 to preserve liquidity. The Company repurchased $9.1 million of stock earlier in the first quarter of 2020 and did not make any repurchases under the program during the remainder of 2020. Upon expiration of the prior stock repurchase program on December 15, 2020, $74.2 million of availability remained under the program. On December 11, 2020, the Board of Directors authorized the 2020 Stock Repurchase Program to commence upon expiration of the prior program. Under the 2020 Stock Repurchase Program, the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $150 million of its issued and outstanding common stock over a three-year period, expiring December 15, 2023. Based on the Company’s current operating plan and the foregoing actions, management believes cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2020, together with cash flows from operating activities, and borrowing available under our Amended Credit Agreement, are sufficient to meet operating and capital expenditure needs, and to service debt, for at least the next 12 months. However, as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the economy and our operations evolves, we may need to obtain alternative sources of capital, and we may finance additional liquidity needs in the future through one or more equity or debt offerings. A continued worldwide disruption, including from additional waves of pandemic outbreaks, from the COVID-19 pandemic, and actions that lending institutions, our customers, consumers and governmental authorities may take in response, could materially affect our future access to sources of liquidity, and there can be no assurance that such capital will be available at all or on reasonable terms. Further, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our future financial performance and thus our cash flows will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the pandemic, its severity, the effectiveness of actions to contain the virus or treat its impact and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions will resume. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience significant adverse impacts on our business, financial performance, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and stock price for a lengthy period of time as a result of its global economic impact. 39 The following table represents our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments , in thousands : Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at beginning of period $ 52,948 $ 39,620 Cash provided by operating activities 110,695 118,803 Cash (used in) provided by investing activities (18,220 ) 5,840 Cash provided by (used in) financing activities 115,480 (108,593 ) Foreign currency effect on cash and cash equivalents 7,442 (2,722 ) Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash at end of period $ 268,345 $ 52,948 Cash Flows From Operating Activities We manage our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to fund operating requirements and preserve liquidity to take advantage of future business opportunities.

Cash Flows From Financing Activities Cash provided by financing activities was $115.5 million during 2020, reflecting additional borrowings on the U.S. Revolving Note totaling $201.2 million partially offset by payments of principal on the U.S. Revolving Note totaling $91.4 million. Borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement mature on June 27, 2024. See Note 9, “Debt” of the consolidated financial statements included in this Report for additional information. Cash was also paid for the repurchase of Common Stock totaling $9.1 million and for cancellations of restricted stock awards totaling $1.1 million, partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of Common Stock options totaling $16.6 million. Debt Amended Credit Agreement On June 27, 2019, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Amended Credit Agreement”) with a consortium of lenders and Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent. The Amended Credit Agreement amended and restated in its entirety the prior Credit Agreement. The outstanding principal and interest of the U.S. Revolving Note under the prior Credit Agreement continued and constitute obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement. The Amended Credit Agreement increased the U.S. Revolving Note from $350.0 million to $475.0 million and extended the maturity from March 17, 2021 to June 27, 2024. The Amended Credit Agreement also provides $15.0 million availability for the issuance of letters of credit and a maximum of $40.0 million for swing line borrowing. Any amount of the facility utilized for letters of credit or swing line loans outstanding will reduce the amount available under the Amended Credit Agreement. The Company had no outstanding letters of credit issued under the Amended Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. The U.S. borrowers and guarantors participating in the Amended Credit Agreement also entered into a related amended and restated pledge and security agreement. The amended and restated pledge and security agreement grants a security interest to the lenders in substantially all of the personal property of the Company and its U.S. subsidiaries designated as borrowers to secure their respective obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement, including the stock and membership interests of specified subsidiaries (limited to 66% of the stock in the case of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries). In addition to the security obligations, all obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by certain of the Company’s subsidiaries. The Amended Credit Agreement restricts, among other things, the amount of dividend payments the Company can make to shareholders. 41 The Amended Credit Agreement contains covenants, that, among other things, ( i ) prohibit or limit the ability of the borrowers and any material subsidiary to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, pay dividends, make certain types of investments (including acquisitions), enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates, prepay other indebtedness, sell assets, merge with other companies or enter into certain other transactions outside the ordinary course of business, and (ii) require that Gentherm maintain a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio and Consolidated Leverage Ratio (based on consolidated EBITDA for the applicable trailing 12-month period as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) as of the end of any fiscal quarter. The Amended Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. As of December 31 , 2020, the Company was in compliance with the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement. Under the Amended Credit Agreement, U.S. Dollar denominated loans bear interest at either a base rate (“Base Rate Loans”) or Eurocurrency rate (“Eurocurrency Rate Loans”), plus a margin (“Applicable Rate”). The rate for Base Rate Loans is equal to the highest of the Federal Funds Rate (0.09% at December 31, 2020) plus 0.50%, Bank of America’s prime rate (3.25% at December 31, 2020), or the Eurocurrency rate plus 1.00%. The rate for Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in U.S. Dollars is equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate (0.14% at December 31, 2020). All loans denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar must be Eurocurrency Rate Loans. Interest is payable at least quarterly. The Applicable Rate varies based on the Consolidated Leverage Ratio reported by the Company. As long as the Company is not in default of the terms and conditions of the Amended Credit Agreement, the lowest and highest possible Applicable Rate is 1.25% and 2.25%, respectively, for Eurocurrency Rate Loans and 0.25% and 1.25%, respectively, for Base Rate Loans. In March 2020, the Company increased its borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement by $169.5 million as a safeguard to increase its cash position and provide additional financial flexibility due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The proceeds have been and will continue to be used for working capital and for other general corporate purposes permitted by the Amended Credit Agreement. After the drawdown in March 2020 and through December 31, 2020, the Company repaid a net amount of $41.2 million of the amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement. In January 2021, the Company repaid an additional $80.0 million of the amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, inclusive of the net new borrowings in 2020, $186.2 million was outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement. Borrowing availability is subject to, among other things, the Company’s compliance with the minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio and Consolidated Leverage Ratio as of the end of any fiscal quarter . Based upon consolidated EBITDA for the trailing twelve months calculated for purposes of the Consolidated Leverage Ratio, $288.8 million remained available as of December 31, 2020 for additional borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement subject to specified conditions that Gentherm currently satisfies. DEG Vietnam Loan The Company also has a fixed interest rate loan with the German Investment Corporation (“DEG”), a subsidiary of KfW Banking Group, a Germany government-owned development bank. The fixed interest rate senior loan agreement with DEG was used to finance the construction and set up of the Vietnam production facility (“DEG Vietnam Loan”). The DEG Vietnam Loan is subject to semi-annual principal payments that began November 2017 and will end May 2023. Under the terms of the DEG Vietnam Loan, the Company must maintain a minimum Enhanced Equity Ratio, as defined by the DEG Vietnam Loan agreement, based on the financial statements of Gentherm’s wholly owned subsidiary, Gentherm Vietnam Co. Ltd. As of December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all terms as outlined in the DEG Vietnam Loan. The following table summarizes the Company’s debt at December 31, 2020 (dollars in thousands).

The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. These estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to: • Product revenues; • Impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets; • Accrued warranty costs; • Income taxes; • Stock compensation; and Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized from agreements containing enforceable rights and obligations, when promised goods are delivered or services are completed. Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are included in net sales, while costs of shipping and handling are included in cost of sales. Automotive Revenues The Company provides production parts to its customers under long-term supply agreements (“LTAs”). The duration of an LTA is generally consistent with the life cycle of a vehicle, however, an LTA does not reach the level of a performance obligation until Gentherm receives either a purchase order and/or a materials release from the customer for a specific number of parts at a specified price, at which point an enforceable contract exists. Revenue is recognized when control of the parts has transferred to the customer according to the terms of the contract, which typically occurs when the parts are shipped or delivered to the customer’s premises. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring parts. Certain LTAs provide for annual price reductions over the production life of the vehicle. Agreements that are determined to provide customers with purchase option discounts that would not be received without entering into the contract are considered to contain a material right (for example, a discount given to a customer that is incremental to the range of discounts typically given to that class of customer). The material right represents a purchase option that provides the customer with the ability to purchase additional production parts at a set price in the future and is accounted for as a separate performance obligation. Under these circumstances, each transfer of production parts under the LTA requires allocation of the purchase price to the production part and the purchase option. As a practical alternative to estimating the standalone selling price of an option, the Company allocates transaction price to the purchase option by reference to the production part volumes expected to be ordered and the consideration expected to be received over the life of the vehicle program. The production part’s relative standalone selling price observed under the LTA is subtracted from the total amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring of parts under the current contract and the difference is allocated to the purchase option. Revenue from options containing a material right is recognized when the amounts billed by the customer for production parts transferred, under the LTA, is less than the standalone selling price of those production parts. Medical Revenues Revenues from our patient temperature management business unit are generated from the sale of products and equipment. Our medical products and equipment focus on body and blood temperature management. The Company sells medical products and equipment primarily through distributor and group purchasing organization agreements. These agreements allow member participants to the distributor or group purchasing organization to make purchases at discounted prices negotiated by the distributor or group purchasing organization. A rebate is incurred at the point in time a member participant purchases product covered under these types of agreements. Rebates are accounted for as variable consideration, using an expected value, probability weighted approach, based on the level of sales to the distributor and the time lag between the initial sale and the rebate claim in determining the transaction price of a contract. Revenue is recognized at the point in time the medical products or equipment is transferred to the customer. 43 Impairments of Goodwill and Other Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually as of December 31 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In conducting our annual impairment assessment testing, we first perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. If not, no further goodwill impairment testing is performed. If it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, or if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit, we then compare the fair value of the reporting unit to the related net book value. If the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. The Company utilizes an income statement approach to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit and a market valuation approach to further support this analysis. The income statement approach is based on projected debt-free cash flow that is discounted to the present value using discount factors that consider the timing and risk of cash flows. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based on the reporting unit’s expected long-term operating cash flow performance. This approach also mitigates the impact of cyclical trends that occur in the industry. Fair value is estimated using internally developed forecasts, as well as commercial and discount rate assumptions. The discount rate used is the value-weighted average of our estimated cost of equity and of debt (“cost of capital”) derived using both known and estimated customary market metrics. Our weighted average cost of capital is adjusted to reflect a risk factor, if necessary. Other significant assumptions include terminal value growth rates, terminal value margin rates, future capital expenditures and changes in future working capital requirements. While there are inherent uncertainties related to the assumptions used and to management’s application of these assumptions to this analysis, we believe that the income statement approach provides a reasonable estimate of the fair value of a reporting unit. The Company performs its indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment annually as of December 31, and between annual assessments if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Accrued Warranty Costs The Company accrues warranty obligations for products sold based on management estimates of future failure rates and current claim cost experience, with support from the sales, engineering, quality and legal functions. While we believe our warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate, such estimates could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future. The warranty policy is reviewed by management annually. Using historical information available to the Company, including claims already filed by customers, the warranty accrual is adjusted quarterly to reflect management’s best estimate of future claims. Income Taxes We record income tax expense using the liability method which specifies that deferred tax assets and liabilities be measured each year based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the applicable enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when management considers it more likely than not that the asset will not be realized. If future annual taxable income were to be significantly less than current and projected levels, there is a risk that certain of our deferred tax assets not already provided for by the valuation allowance would expire prior to utilization. We recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Stock Based Compensation We account for grants of employee stock options, time-based restricted stock units and restricted stock as compensation expense based upon the fair value on the date of grant and such expense is recognized over the vesting condition, either based on a period of service or based on the performance of a specific achievement. We also have granted restricted stock units measured based on either a target return on invested capital ratio (“ROIC”), as defined in the award agreement, for a specified fiscal year, or the Company’s common stock market price returning a target total shareholder return (“TSR”), as defined, during a specific three-year measurement period. Upon achievement of the performance measurement, performance-based restricted stock units (“PSUs”) cliff vest after three years. Under FASB ASC Topic 718, the provisions of the PSUs that vest upon the achievement of relative TSR are considered a market condition, and therefore the effect of that market condition is reflected in the grant date fair value for this portion of the award. A third party was engaged to complete a “Monte Carlo simulation” to account for the market condition. That simulation takes into account the beginning stock price of our 44 common stock, the expected volatilities for the TSR comparator group, the expected volatilities for the Company’s stock price, correlation coefficients, the expected risk-free rate of return and the expected dividend yield of the Company and the comparator group. The single grant-date fair value computed by this valuation method is recognized by the Company in accounting for the awards regardless of the actual future outcome of the relative TSR feature. The grant date fair value of the other PSUs and RSUs are calculated as the closing price of our common stock as quoted on Nasdaq on the grant date multiplied by the number of shares subject to the award. ROIC is considered a performance condition and the grant-date fair value for ROIC PSUs corresponds with management's expectation of the probable outcome of the performance condition as of the grant date. Stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) are also an award type granted under our management incentive program and they are accounted for using the liability method since they are settled in cash, which requires mark-to-market adjustments based on the current trading price of Gentherm Common Stock to be recognized in statements of income. Recent Accounting Pronouncements For a complete description of recent accounting standards which we have not yet been required to implement which may be applicable to our operations, as well as significant accounting standards that have been adopted during the year ended December 31, 2020, see Note 3, “New Accounting Pronouncements” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2020, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are, in the opinion of management, reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Effects of Inflation The automotive component supply industry is subject to inflationary pressures with respect to raw materials and labor, which have historically placed operational and financial burdens on the entire supply chain. Accordingly, the Company continues to take actions with its customers and suppliers to mitigate the impact of these inflationary pressures in the future. Actions to mitigate inflationary pressures with customers include collaboration on alternative product designs and material specifications, contractual price escalation clauses on specified materials and negotiated customer recoveries. Actions to mitigate inflationary pressures with suppliers include aggregation of purchase requirements to achieve optimal volume benefits, negotiation of cost-reductions and identification of more cost competitive suppliers. While these actions are designed to offset the impact of inflationary pressures, the Company cannot provide assurance that it will be successful in fully offsetting increased costs resulting from inflationary pressure . Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following table summarizes our expected cash outflows resulting from financial contracts and commitments as of December 31, 2020. We have not included information on our recurring purchases of materials for use in our manufacturing operations. These amounts are generally consistent from year to year, closely reflect our levels of production and are not long-term in nature: Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations (in thousands) Total 2021 2022 & 2023 2024 & 2025 Thereafter Long-term debt obligations (1) $ 192,434 $ 2,500 $ 3,750 $ 186,184 $ — Operating lease obligations $ 35,303 $ 7,316 $ 10,049 $ 7,477 $ 10,461 Purchase commitments 2,500 2,500 — — — Total $ 230,237 $ 12,316 $ 13,799 $ 193,661 $ 10,461 (1) Long-term debt obligations do not include an amount payable for interest. The Company does not have any outstanding capital lease agreements. 45 I TEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations and foreign currency contracts. We have in the past, and may in the future, place our investments in bank certificates of deposits, debt instruments of the U. S. government, and in high-quality corporate issuers. We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, short-term interest rates and price fluctuations of certain material commodities. Market risks for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our debt obligations under our Amended Credit Agreement. Foreign currency exchange risks are attributable to sales to foreign customers and purchases from foreign suppliers not denominated in a location’s functional currency, foreign plant operations, intercompany indebtedness, intercompany investments and include exposures to the Euro, Mexican Peso, Canadian Dollar, Hungarian Forint, Macedonian Denar, Ukrainian Hryvnia, Japanese Yen, Chinese Renminbi, Korean Won and Vietnamese Dong. The Company regularly enters into derivative contracts with the objective of managing its financial and operational exposure arising from these risks by offsetting gains and losses on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the financial instruments used to hedge them. The maximum length of time over which we hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange risks is one year. We had foreign currency derivative contracts with a notional value of $13.3 million and $14.4 million outstanding at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The potential loss in fair value for such financial instruments from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in quoted currency exchange rates would be approximately $1.3 million and $1.4 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The potential gain in fair value from a hypothetical 10% change in quoted currency exchange rates would be approximately $1.6 million and $1.7 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The impact of a 10% change in rates on fair value differs from a 10% change in the net fair value asset due to the existence of hedges. The model assumes a parallel shift in currency exchange rates; however, currency exchange rates rarely move in the same direction. The assumption that currency exchange rates change in a parallel fashion may overstate the impact of changing currency exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Our hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedge, and hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions both at the inception of a hedge and on an ongoing basis to be designated for hedge accounting treatment. For derivative contracts which can be classified as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheet. When the underlying hedge transaction is realized, the gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive loss is recorded in earnings in the consolidated statements of income on the same line as the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. We record the ineffective portion of foreign currency hedging instruments, if any, to foreign currency gain (loss) in the consolidated statements of income. Though we continuously monitor the hedging program, derivative positions and hedging strategies, foreign currency forward exchange agreements have not always been designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. The Company uses an income approach to value derivative instruments, analyzing quoted market prices to calculate the forward values and then discounts such forward values to the present value using benchmark rates at commonly quoted intervals for the instrument’s full term.

The fair value of our variable-rate debt at December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $186.2 million and $71.9 million, respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point change (increase or decrease) in interest rates would create an estimated change in fair value of our fixed-rate debt of approximately $0.1 million as of December 31, 2020. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in interest rates on our variable-rate debt would change interest expense on an annual basis by approximately $0.9 million.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Management of the Company, under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2020. As defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (as amended, the “Exchange Act”), disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2020. Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f), for the Company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 based on the framework set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).” Based on that evaluation, management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020. The attestation report of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, regarding the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, is set forth in Item 15, ""Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules,"" included under the caption ""Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"". Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2020, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated March 1, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical audit matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated fi nancial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates. Valuation of Goodwill – Medical Description of the Matter As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s goodwill related to the medical reporting unit (segment) was $28.5 million. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually as of December 31 and w henever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than it’s carrying amount. Auditing management’s annual goodwill impairment assessment for the medical reporting unit was complex and highly judgmental due to the significant estimation required to determine the fair value of the reporting unit. In particular, the fair value estimates used in the valuation of the medical reporting unit were sensitive to significant assumptions, such as changes in the discount rate, revenue growth rates, including the terminal growth rate and operating margins, which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions. How We Addressed the Matter in our Audit We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s annual goodwill assessment, and annual forecasting process whereby the Company develops significant assumptions that are used in its analyses. This included controls over management's review of the valuation model and the significant assumptions used in the fair value measurements discussed above. To test the estimated fair value of the Company’s medical reporting unit, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the methodologies used and directly testing the significant assumptions and the underlying data used by the Company in its analysis, including assessing the completeness and accuracy of such underlying data. We utilized internal valuation specialists to assist in the evaluation of the assumptions and other relevant information that are most significant to the fair value estimate of the reporting unit such as assessing the fair value methodologies applied and evaluating the reasonableness of the discount rate selected by management. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends, historical performance, guideline public companies in the same industry and strategic plans. We performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the fair value of the reporting unit that would result from changes in the assumptions. Furthermore, we assessed the appropriateness of the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. F-2 /s/ ERNST & YOUNG LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2020. Detroit, Michigan March 1, 2021 F-3 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Gentherm Incorporated Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Gentherm Incorporated’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Gentherm Incorporated (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Company as of December 31, 2020, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 and our report dated March 1, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ ERNST & YOUNG LLP Detroit, Michigan March 1, 2021 F-4 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Board of Directors and Shareholders Gentherm Incorporated Opinion on the financial statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Gentherm Incorporated (a Michigan corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the related notes and financial statement schedule included under Item 15 (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”).

Incorporated is a global developer and marketer of innovative thermal management technologies for a broad range of heating and cooling and temperature control applications. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “Gentherm”, “Company”, “we”, “us” and “our” used herein refer to Gentherm Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries. Our products provide solutions for automotive passenger climate comfort and convenience, battery thermal management and cell connecting systems, as well as patient temperature management within the health care industry. Our automotive products can be found on the vehicles of nearly all major automotive manufacturers operating in North America and Europe and several major automotive manufacturers in Asia. We operate in locations aligned with our major customers’ product strategies to provide locally enhanced design, integration and production capabilities. The Company is also developing a number of new technologies and products that is expected to help enable improvements to existing products and to create new product applications for existing and new markets. On February 1, 2019, the Company completed the divestiture of its environmental test equipment business, Cincinnati Sub Zero industrial chamber business (“CSZ-IC”) and on October 1, 2019, the Company completed the divestiture of its remote power generation systems business, Gentherm Global Power Technologies (“GPT”). The Company’s consolidated financial statements herein include the results of CSZ-IC and GPT through their respective dates of divestiture. CSZ-IC and GPT are not subject to discontinued operations classification. Impact of COVID-19 The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted global economic activity, including the automotive market. The COVID-19 pandemic was first identified in China around December 2019. The impact of the outbreak quickly expanded beyond China and its surrounding region and has significantly and adversely impacted the entire global economy and automotive market in 2020. During the first quarter of 2020, customer plants in North America and Europe were closed beginning in the second half of March due to the pandemic. This resulted in temporary, partial closures of several of our manufacturing facilities in North America and Europe by the end of March 2020. Customer plants and our manufacturing facilities in Asia were closed for several weeks in February and operated at reduced volumes in March, resuming production to near full capacity by the end of the first quarter, which continued throughout the second quarter. However, during the second quarter of 2020, our manufacturing facilities in North America and Europe remained closed until the last week in May due to the pandemic, gradually resuming production to near full capacity in North America, and to about 70 % capacity in Europe by the end of June. During the second half of 2020, our customers’ plants were open, and our production volumes were stronger than pre-COVID levels at our manufacturing facilities. The Company has implemented additional health and safety precautions and protocols in response to the pandemic and government guidelines to help ensure the safety and health of all its employees, and it continues to assess and update business continuity plans in the context of this pandemic. The consequences of the pandemic and adverse impact to the economy continue to evolve and the future adverse impact on our business and financial statements remains subject to significant uncertainty as of the date of this filing. Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. In 2020, the Industrial reporting segment was renamed the Medical reporting segment to reflect the patient temperature management business as the focus and strategic direction of this segment, and the advanced research and development organization was moved to the Automotive segment. See below under “Segment Reporting” in this footnote and Note 20, “Segment Reporting” for further details. Revision of Prior Period Financial Statements During the fourth quarter of 2020, management determined that certain deferred tax assets were not properly evaluated for realizability under ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes which resulted in an immaterial error that affected previously issued financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019. In accordance with ASC 250: Accounting Changes and Error Corrections (“ASC F-11 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) 250”), w e have corrected the error by revising the historical consolidated financial statements and related disclosures for the year ended December 31, 2019 . Management evaluated the effect of the adjustment on the Company’s financial statements under provision ASC 250, Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99: Materiality, and Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements and concluded that the adjustment made was immaterial to the previously issued financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019. The impact to the consolidated statements of income for the year ended December 31, 2019 and the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2019 As Reported Adjustment As Revised Income Statement: Earnings before income tax $ 59,151 $ — $ 59,151 Income tax expense 21,645 ( 11,360 ) 10,285 Net income 37,506 11,360 48,866 Basic EPS $ 1.13 $ 0.35 $ 1.48 Diluted EPS $ 1.13 $ 0.34 $ 1.47 December 31, 2019 As Reported Adjustment As Revised Balance Sheet: Deferred income tax asset - long term $ 57,650 $ 11,446 $ 69,096 Total non-current assets 353,523 11,446 364,969 Total assets 727,386 11,446 738,832 Accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income ( 42,441 ) 86 ( 42,355 ) Accumulated earnings 401,732 11,360 413,092 Total shareholders' equity $ 727,386 $ 11,446 $ 738,832 Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly owned subsidiaries and those entities in which it has a controlling financial interest. Investments in affiliates in which Gentherm does not have control but does have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are accounted for under the equity method. When Gentherm does not have the ability to exercise significant influence (generally when ownership interest is less than 20 %), investments in affiliates are measured at cost, less impairments, adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Use of Estimates In preparing these financial statements, management was required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are based on our historical experience, the terms of existing contracts, our evaluation of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers and suppliers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. These estimates and assumptions are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. We are not presently aware of any events or circumstances that would require us to update such estimates and assumptions or revise the carrying value of our assets or liabilities. Our estimates may change, however, as new events occur and additional information is obtained. As a result, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates, and any such differences may be material to our financial statements. F-12 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Segment Reporting The Company has two reportable segments: Automotive , which includes automotive climate comfort systems, automotive cable systems, battery performance solutions and automotive electronic and software systems; and Medical . In 2018 and 2019, our Industrial reporting segment represented the combined results from our patient temperature management systems business (“Medical”), remote power generation systems business, Gentherm Global Power Technologies (“GPT”) (through its divestiture on October 1, 2019), environmental test equipment business, Cincinnati Sub Zero industrial chamber business (“CSZ-IC”) (through its divestiture on February 1, 2019) and our advanced research and development division. The operating results from these businesses and division previously were presented together as one reporting segment because of their historical joint concentration on identifying new markets and product applications based on thermal management technologies. In 2020, the Industrial reporting segment was renamed the Medical reporting segment to reflect the patient temperature management business as the focus and strategic direction of this segment. Also, during 2020, the advanced research and development costs not associated with the Medical segment were moved to the Automotive segment, as this organization primarily supports the Automotive related research and development activities following the divestitures of GPT and CSZ-IC. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized from agreements containing enforceable rights and obligations, when promised goods are delivered or services are completed. Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from Product revenues. Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are included in Product revenues, while costs of shipping and handling are included in Cost of sales. Automotive Revenues The Company provides production parts to its customers under long-term supply agreements (“LTAs”). The duration of an LTA is generally consistent with the life cycle of a vehicle; however, an LTA does not reach the level of a performance obligation until Gentherm receives either a purchase order and/or a materials release from the customer for a specific number of production parts at a specified price, at which point an enforceable contract exists. Revenue is recognized when control of the production parts has transferred to the customer according to the terms of the contract, which typically occurs when the parts are shipped or delivered to the customer’s premises. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring production parts. Certain LTAs provide for annual price reductions over the production life of the vehicle. Agreements that are determined to provide customers with purchase option discounts that would not be received without entering into the contract are considered to contain a material right (for example, a discount given to a customer that is incremental to the range of discounts typically given to that class of customer). The material right represents a purchase option that provides the customer with the ability to purchase additional production parts at a set price in the future and is accounted for as a separate performance obligation. Under these circumstances, each transfer of production parts under the LTA requires allocation of the purchase price to the production part and the purchase option. As a practical alternative to estimating the standalone selling price of an option, the Company allocates transaction price to the purchase option by reference to the production part volumes expected to be ordered and the consideration expected to be received over the life of the vehicle program. The production part’s relative standalone selling price observed under the LTA is subtracted from the total amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring of parts under the current contract and the difference is allocated to the purchase option. Revenue from options containing a material right is recognized when the amounts billed by the customer for production parts transferred, under the LTA, is less than the standalone selling price of those production parts. F-13 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Medical Revenues Revenues from our patient temperature management business unit are generated from the sale of products and equipment. Our medical products and equipment focus on body and blood temperature management. The Company sells medical products and equipment primarily through distributor and group purchasing organization agreements. These agreements allow member participants to the distributor or group purchasing organization to make purchases at discounted prices negotiated by the distributor or group purchasing organization. A rebate is incurred at the point in time a member participant purchases product covered under these types of agreements. Rebates are accounted for as variable consideration, using an expected value, probability weighted approach, based on the level of sales to the distributor and the time lag between the initial sale and the rebate claim in determining the transaction price of a contract. Revenue is recognized at the point in time the medical products or equipment is transferred to the customer. GPT and CSZ-IC Revenues Revenues from our divested businesses, GPT and CSZ-IC, were generated from the sale of products and services. GPT and CSZ-IC customers commonly entered into multiple-element agreements for the purchase of products and services. Installation services, for example, were separate and distinct performance obligations that were often included in contracts to purchase customized environmental test chambers. Depending on the application, delivery of an environmental test chamber or remote power generation system to the customer’s place of business could range from two weeks to nine months from commencement of the contract. Installation services, while reliant on the specifications and timing from the customer, rarely remained incomplete more than two months after delivery. Revenues allocated to environmental test chambers or remote power systems were based on the stand-alone selling price of the products themselves. Judgement was used to determine the degree to which early pay discounts and other credits were utilized in the calculation of standalone selling price, and only included to the extent it was probable that a significant reversal of any incremental revenue would not occur. Revenues were recognized at the point in time the chamber or power system was shipped to the customer. For contracts that also included a promise for installation, the portion of total transaction price allocated to the installation was recognized as revenue at the point in time the installation was complete. GPT and CSZ-IC often required milestone payments for contracts to provide environmental test chambers or remote power systems to customers. Milestone payments did not provide the Company with a right to payment for the work completed to date and did not represent the satisfaction of a performance obligation. Milestone payments were deferred and reported within unearned revenue until construction was complete and the unit had been delivered or was installed. If the environmental test chamber contract included a separate promise to provide installation services, any installation-related payments received from the customer were deferred until the point in time the installation was complete. Assets Recognized from the Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if the benefits of those costs are expected to be realized for a period greater than one year . Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were $ 1,805 and $ 1,893 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These amounts are recorded in Other current assets and are being amortized into Product revenues over the expected production life of the program. During the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, $ 263 and $ 1,006 , respectively, was amortized into Product revenues. Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of less than 90 days to be cash equivalents. Cash balances in individual banks may exceed the federally insured limit by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Company had Cash and cash equivalents of $ 106,598 and $ 35,735 held in foreign jurisdictions as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Restricted cash includes cash that is legally restricted as to use or withdrawal. F-14 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of financial instruments comprising cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable approximate fair value because of the short maturities of these instruments. The carrying amount of the Company’s U.S. Revolving Note approximates its fair value because interest charged on the loan balance is variable. See Note 14 for information about the techniques used to assess the fair value of financial assets and liabilities, including our fixed rate debt instruments. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial assets, which subject the Company to concentration of credit risk, consist primarily of cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable. Cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds managed by major financial services companies. The credit risk for these cash equivalents is considered low. The Company does not require collateral from its customers. As of December 31, 2020, Lear and Adient both individually represented 18 % of the Company’s accounts receivable balance. As of December 31, 2019, Lear and Adient both individually represented 21 % of the Company’s accounts receivable balance. These accounts are currently in good standing. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are stated at the invoiced amount, less allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated amounts not expected to be collected, and do not bear interest. The Company determines the allowances based on historical write-off experience by industry and regional economic data, current expectations of future credit losses and historical cash discounts. The Company’s accounts receivables are continually assessed for collectability and any allowance is recorded based upon the age of outstanding receivables, historical payment experience and customer creditworthiness. We write-off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $ 1,161 and $ 1,193 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Inventory The Company’s inventory is measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost being determined using the first-in first-out basis. Raw materials, consumables and commodities are measured at cost of purchase and unfinished and finished goods are measured at cost of production, using the weighted average method. If the net realizable value expected on the reporting date is below cost, a write-down is recorded to adjust inventory to its net realizable value. We recognize a reserve for obsolete and slow-moving inventories based on estimates of future sales and an inventory item’s capacity to be repurposed for a different use. We consider the number of months supply on hand based on current planned requirements, uncommitted future projections and historical usage in estimating the inventory reserve. Property and Equipment Property and equipment, including additions and improvements, are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for general repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. When property or equipment is retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts. Gains or losses from retirements and disposals are recorded as Operating income or expense. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives of the Company’s Property and equipment are as follows: F-15 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Asset Category Useful Life Buildings and improvements 2 to 50 years Plant and equipment 1 to 20 years Production tooling 2 to 10 years Leasehold improvements Term of lease Information technology 1 to 10 years The Company recognized depreciation expense of $ 31,037 , $ 33,639 and $ 36,270 for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Tooling The Company incurs costs related to tooling used in the manufacture of products sold to its customers. In some cases, the Company enters into contracts with its customers whereby the Company incurs the costs to design, develop and purchase tooling and is then reimbursed by the customer under a reimbursement contract. Tooling costs that will be reimbursed by customers are included in Other current assets at the lower of accumulated cost or the customer reimbursable amount. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, $ 4,831 and $ 5,347 of reimbursable tooling was capitalized within Other current assets. Company-owned tooling is included in Property and equipment and depreciated over its expected useful life, generally two to ten years . Management periodically evaluates the recoverability of tooling costs, based on estimated future cash flows, and makes provisions, where appropriate, for tooling costs that will not be recovered. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in conjunction with business combinations are based on the Company’s estimate of fair value, as of the date of acquisition. Amortization is computed using the straight-line method. The fair value and corresponding useful lives for acquired intangible assets are listed below as follows: Asset Category Useful Life Customer relationships 6 to 15 years Technology 4 to 8 years Product development costs 1 to 15 years Trade names Indefinite Our business strategy largely centers on designing products based upon internally developed and purchased technology, and we protect certain technology with patents that have value to our business strategy. Our policy is to expense all costs associated with the development and issuance of new patents as incurred. Such costs are classified as research and development expenses in our consolidation statements of income. Patents purchased as part of a business combination are capitalized based on their fair values. Periodically we review the recoverability and remaining lives of our capitalized patents. If necessary, we make adjustments to reported amounts based upon unfavorable impacts from market conditions, the emergence of competitive technologies or changes in our projected business plans. Impairments of Long-Lived Assets, Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill Goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually as of December 31 and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. In conducting our annual impairment assessment testing, we first perform a qualitative assessment of whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount. If not, no further goodwill impairment testing is performed. If it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, or if we elect not to perform a qualitative assessment of a reporting unit, we then compare the fair value of the reporting unit F-16 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) to the related net book value. If the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. The Company utilizes an income statement approach to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit and a market valuation approach to further support this analysis (level 3). The income statement approach is based on projected debt-free cash flow that is discounted to the present value using discount factors that consider the timing and risk of cash flows. We believe that this approach is appropriate because it provides a fair value estimate based on the reporting unit’s expected long-term operating cash flow performance. This approach also mitigates the impact of cyclical trends that occur in the industry. Fair value is estimated using internally developed forecasts, as well as commercial and discount rate assumptions. The discount rate used is the value-weighted average of our estimated cost of equity and of debt (“cost of capital”) derived using both known and estimated customary market metrics. Our weighted average cost of capital is adjusted to reflect a risk factor, if necessary. Other significant assumptions include terminal value growth rates, terminal value margin rates, future capital expenditures and changes in future working capital requirements. While there are inherent uncertainties related to the assumptions used and to management’s application of these assumptions to this analysis, we believe that the income statement approach provides a reasonable estimate of the fair value of a reporting unit. The Company performs its indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment assessment annually as of December 31, and between annual assessments if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount . Accrued Warranty Costs The Company accrues warranty obligations for products sold based on management estimates of future failure rates and current claim cost experience, with support from the sales, engineering, quality and legal functions. Using historical information available to the Company, including claims already filed by customers, the warranty accrual is adjusted quarterly to reflect management’s best estimate of future claims. Research and Development Expenses Research and development activities are expensed as incurred. The Company groups development and prototype costs and related reimbursements in Research and development. The Company recognizes amounts due as reimbursements for expenses as these expenses are incurred. Leases The Company has operating leases for office, manufacturing and research and development facilities, as well as land leases for certain manufacturing facilities that are accounted for as operating leases. We also have operating leases for office equipment and automobiles. Excluding land leases, our leases have remaining lease terms ranging from less than 1 year to 11 years and may include options to extend the lease. Land leases have remaining lease terms that range from 40 to 42 years and some which specify that the end of the lease term is at the discretion of the lessee. We do not have lease arrangements with related parties. The Company determines whether a contractual arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Leases that are operating in nature are recognized in Operating lease right-of-use assets, Current lease liabilities and Non-current lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Gentherm is not currently party to any leases that qualify as financing leases. Lease liabilities are measured initially at the present value of the sum of the future minimum rental payments at the commencement date of the lease. Lease payments that will vary in the future due to changes in facts and circumstances are excluded from the calculation of rental payments, unless those variable payments are based on an index or rate. Rental payments are discounted using an incremental borrowing rate based on the Company’s credit rating, determined on a fully collateralized loan basis from information available at commencement date, and the duration of the lease term (the “reference rate”). Judgement is used to assess the F-17 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) importance of risk factor inputs during the computation of the Company’s credit rating. For leases at foreign subsidiaries denominated in U.S. Dollars, a risk premium associated with the borrower subsidiary’s country is added to the reference rate. For significant leases at foreign subsidiaries denominated in a foreign currency, the U.S. Dollar risk free rate with a duration similar to that of the lease term is subtracted from the reference rate and a corresponding foreign currency risk free rate with a duration similar to that of the lease term is added to the reference rate. Operating lease right-of-use assets are measured at the amount of the lease liability, adjusted for prepaid or accrued lease payments, lease incentive received, and initial direct costs incurred, as applicable. Periods covered by an option to extend the lease are initially included in the measurement of an operating lease right-of-use asset and lease liability only when it is reasonably certain we will exercise the option. Gentherm’s lease agreements do not contain residual value guarantees or impose restrictions or covenants on the Company. For all classes of underlying assets, the Company accounts for leases that contain separate lease and non-lease components as containing a single lease component. The Company does not recognize lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities from leases with an original lease term of 12 months or less and, instead, recognizes rent payments on a straight-line basis over the lease term in the consolidated statements of income. Income Taxes The Company records income tax expense using the liability method which specifies that deferred tax assets and liabilities be measured each year based on the difference between the financial statement and tax base of assets and liabilities at the applicable enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when management considers it more likely than not that the asset will not be realized. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, a valuation allowance has been provided for certain deferred tax assets which the Company has concluded are more likely than not to not be realized. If future annual taxable income were to be significantly less than current and projected levels, there is a risk that certain of our deferred tax assets not already provided for by the valuation allowance would expire prior to utilization. The Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in Income tax expense. Derivative Financial Instruments – Hedge Accounting The Company accounts for some of its derivative financial instruments as cash flow hedges. For derivative contracts which can be classified as a cash flow hedge, the effective potion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is recorded to Accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets. When the underlying hedge transaction is realized, the gain or loss included in Accumulated other comprehensive income is recorded in earnings in the consolidated statements of income on the same line as the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. Any ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of income under Foreign currency (loss) gain. These hedging transactions and the respective correlations meet the requirements for hedge accounting. Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the respective period. The Company’s diluted earnings per common share give effect to all potential shares of Common Stock outstanding during a period that are not anti-dilutive. In computing the number of diluted shares outstanding, the treasury stock method is used in order to arrive at a net number of shares created upon the conversion of Common Stock equivalents. F-18 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Stock Based Compensation Share based payments that involve the issuance of Common Stock to employees, including grants of employee stock options, restricted stock, and time-based and performance-based restricted stock units, are recognized in the financial statements as compensation expense based upon the fair value on the date of grant. Performance-based restricted stock unit awards are measured based on either a target return on invested capital ratio (“ROIC”), as defined in the award agreement, for a specified fiscal year, or the Company’s common stock market price returning a target total shareholder return (“TSR”), as defined, during a specific three-year measurement period. Performance-based restricted stock units cliff vest after three years based on the achievement of performance measurements. Share based payments that are satisfied only by the payment of cash, such as stock appreciation rights, are accounted for as liabilities. The liability is reported at market value of the vested portion of the underlying units. During each period, the change in the liability is recorded as compensation expense during periods when the liability increases or income during periods in which the liability decreases. Pension Plans The Company’s obligations and expenses for its pension plans are dependent on the Company’s selection of discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and other assumptions used by actuaries to calculate these amounts. Note 3 — New Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Expected Credit Losses In June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-13, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” ASU 2016-13 requires measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets held. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13 as of January 1, 2020 and there was no significant impact on its consolidated condensed financial statements and related disclosures as a result. The Company considered, among other things, the current and expected future economic and market conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic and determined that the estimate of credit losses was not significantly impacted. Cloud Computing Arrangements That Are Service Contracts In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, “Intangibles – Goodwill and Other – Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract.” ASU 2018-15 requires implementation costs incurred by customers in cloud computing arrangements to be deferred and recognized over the term of the arrangement if those costs would be capitalized by the customer in a software licensing arrangement under the internal-use software guidance. The Company adopted ASU 2018-15 as of January 1, 2020 and there was no significant impact on its consolidated condensed financial statements and related disclosures as a result. Fair Value Measurement In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework – Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement.” ASU 2018-13 removes certain disclosure requirements, including (i) the amount of and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, (ii) the policy for timing of transfer between levels, and (iii) the valuation processes for Level 3 fair value measurements. ASU 2018-13 also adds new disclosure requirements, including (i) the changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period included in other comprehensive income for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements held at the end of the reporting period and (ii) the range and weighted average of significant F-19 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements. The Company adopted ASU 2018-13 as of January 1, 2020 and there was no significant impact on its consolidated condensed financial statements and related disclosures as a result. Retirement Benefits In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, “Compensation – Retirement Benefits – Defined Benefit Plans – General (Subtopic 715-20): Disclosure Framework – Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans.” ASU 2018-14 removes certain disclosure requirements, including (i) the amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income expected to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year, and (ii) the amount and timing of plan assets expected to be returned to the employer. ASU 2018-14 also adds new disclosure requirements, including (i) the weighted-average interest crediting rates for cash balance plans and other plans with promised interest crediting rates and (ii) an explanation of the reasons for significant gains and losses related to changes in the benefit obligation for the period. The Company adopted ASU 2018-14 as of December 31, 2020 and there was no significant impact on its consolidated condensed financial statements and related disclosures as a result. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted Income Taxes In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, ""Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes"". This ASU simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions previously included in the guidance. In addition, the ASU amends existing guidance to improve consistent application. ASU 2019-12 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those reporting periods. Early adoption of the amendments in this update is permitted. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s financial statements or financial disclosures . Reference Rate Reform In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting”. ASU 2020-04 provides practical expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The expedients and exceptions provided by the amendments in this update apply only to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued as a result of reference rate reform. These amendments are not applicable to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated after December 31, 2022. ASU No. 2020-04 is effective as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022 and may be applied to contract modifications and hedging relationships from the beginning of an interim period that includes or is subsequent to March 12, 2020. The Company will adopt this standard when LIBOR is discontinued and does not expect a material impact to its consolidated financial statements. Note 4 – Acquisitions and Divestitures In June 2018, Gentherm announced a new strategic plan. An important element of the strategy was the elimination of investments in non-core areas, including GPT and CSZ-IC. The strategy also identified several product categories the Company exited in 2018, including furniture, aviation, battery management electronics, industrial battery packs, automotive thermoelectric generators and other non-core electronics. During the year ended December 31, 2018, Gentherm determined that GPT and CSZ-IC met the held for sale criteria and recognized $ 11,476 of asset impairment charges, consisting of $ 6,151 of goodwill impairment charges, $ 3,135 of other intangible asset impairment charges and $ 2,190 of impairment on assets held for sale. These impairment charges are reported within the Medical segment and are classified as Impairment loss within the consolidated statements of income. F-20 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Divestiture of CSZ-IC On February 1, 2019, the Company completed the sale of CSZ-IC and former Cincinnati Sub-Zero headquarters facility to Weiss Technik North America, Inc. for total cash proceeds of $ 47,500 , including $ 2,500 of cash proceeds placed into an escrow account for a period of up to one year as partial security for the Company’s obligations under the sale agreement. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company resolved its remaining obligations under the sale agreement, and the amounts in escrow were released net of settlement for obligations under the sale agreement. In connection with the sale, Gentherm entered into an operating lease agreement for a portion of the office and manufacturing building space purchased by Weiss Technik North America, Inc. The Company recognized a $ 4,298 pre-tax gain on the sale of CSZ-IC for the year ended December 31, 2019 which is classified as Net loss on divestitures within the consolidated statements of income. Divestiture of GPT During 2019, the Company continued to assess the fair value of the GPT disposal group, less costs to sell, at each reporting period. As a result of these fair value measurements, the Company recognized additional impairment losses of $ 21,206 consisting of $ 4,486 of impairment of an equity investment that met the held for sale criteria during 2019 and $ 16,720 of impairment on assets held for sale. These impairment charges are classified as Impairment loss within the consolidated statements of income. On October 1, 2019, the Company completed the sale of GPT for a nominal amount and recognized a $ 5,885 loss on sale for the year ended December 31, 2019, which included $ 1,500 related to a loan to the buyer that was considered uncollectible, which is classified as Net loss on divestitures within the consolidated statements of income. Acquisition of Stihler Electronic GmbH On April 1, 2019, Gentherm acquired Stihler Electronic GmbH (“Stihler”), a leading developer and manufacturer of patient and blood temperature management systems, for a purchase price of $ 15,476 , net of cash acquired and including $ 653 of contingent consideration to be paid upon achievement of a milestone that was completed in September 2020. In addition, the purchase agreement included a contingent payment of $ 653 paid for the selling shareholder remaining employed by Stihler through December 2020. This was completed and the payment was recorded as a component of Selling, general and administrative expenses ratably over the service period. The results of operations of Stihler are reported within the Company’s Medical segment from the date of acquisition. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company incurred acquisition-related costs of approximately $ 324 . These amounts were recorded as incurred, within the consolidated statements of income. The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination. The purchase price and related allocation to the acquired net assets of Stihler, based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date, are shown below: Purchase price, cash consideration, net of cash acquired $ 14,823 Purchase price, fair value of contingent consideration 653 Total purchase price, net of cash acquired 15,476 Accounts receivable 883 Inventory 1,698 Prepaid expenses and other assets 241 Operating lease right-of-use assets 263 Property and equipment 260 Other intangible assets 4,380 Goodwill 9,816 Assumed liabilities ( 2,065 ) Net assets acquired $ 15,476 Other intangible assets primarily include amounts recognized for the fair value of customer-related intangible assets, which will be amortized over their estimated useful lives of approximately 9 years. The estimated fair value of these assets was based on third- F-21 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) party valuations and management’s estimates, generally utilizing an income approach. Goodwill recognized in this transaction is primarily attributable to intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. A total of $ 2,524 of the goodwill recognized was deductible for income tax purposes . The pro forma effect of the Stihler acquisition does not materially impact the Company’s reported results for any period presented, and as a result no pro forma financial statements are presented. Note 5 — Restructuring Manufacturing Footprint Rationalization On September 23, 2019, the Company committed to a restructuring plan to improve the Company’s manufacturing productivity and rationalize its footprint. Under this plan, the Company will relocate and consolidate certain existing automotive manufacturing and, as a result, reduce the number of plants by two. On March 20, 2020, the Company announced the initial phase of this restructuring plan, which includes the consolidation of all North American electronics manufacturing to Celaya, Mexico. This will result in the closure of the Burlington, Canada facility, and the transfer of electronics manufacturing from Acuña, Mexico. During the second quarter of 2020, due to circumstances arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, management adjusted the plan to proactively manage its cash position. Adjustments to the plan have resulted in changes to the estimated number of employee separations and total costs to execute the plan. On December 10, 2020, the Company announced the consolidation of our electronics manufacturing in Asia to Bantian, Shenzhen, China, which will result in the closure of our Longgang, Shenzhen, China facility that is expected to be completed by the end of 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized restructuring expense of $( 832 ) for employee separation costs, $ 687 for accelerated depreciation and $ 332 for other costs. The net activity for the year ended December 31, 2020 is primarily related to a reduction in the estimates of previously recognized employee separation costs. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized restructuring expense of $ 4,863 for employee separation costs, and $ 2,087 of accelerated depreciation and fixed asset impairment. The Company has recorded approximately $ 7,137 of restructuring expenses since the inception of this program. Under the revised restructuring plan, the Company expects to incur total costs of between $ 16,000 and $ 19,000 , of which between $ 13,000 and $ 16,000 are expected to be cash expenditures. The total expected costs include employee separation costs of between $ 6,500 and $ 7,500 , capital expenditures of between $ 3,500 and $ 4,500 and non-cash expenses for accelerated depreciation and impairment of fixed assets of approximately $ 3,000 . The Company also expects to incur other transition costs including recruiting, relocation, and machinery and equipment move and set up costs of between $ 3,000 and $ 4,000 . The actions under this plan are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2021. The actual timing, costs and savings of the plan may differ materially from the Company’s current expectations and estimates. Other Restructuring Activities As part of the Company’s continued efforts to optimize its cost structure, the Company has undertaken several discrete restructuring actions. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company recognized $ 5,382 , $ 2,942 and $ 6,598 of employee separation costs, respectively, and $ 234 , $ 1,360 and $ 2,869 of other related costs, respectively. These restructuring expenses were primarily associated with restructuring actions focused on optimizing our manufacturing and engineering footprint and the reduction of global overhead costs.

On June 27, 2019, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Amended Credit Agreement”) with a consortium of lenders and Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent. The Amended Credit Agreement amended and restated in its entirety the Credit Agreement. The outstanding principal and interest of the U.S. Revolving Note under the Credit Agreement continued and constitute obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement. The Amended Credit Agreement increased the U.S. Revolving Note from $ 350,000 to $ 475,000 and extended the maturity from March 17, 2021 to June 27, 2024 . The Amended Credit Agreement also provides $ 15,000 availability for the issuance of letters of credit and a maximum of $ 40,000 for swing line borrowing. Any amount of the facility utilized for letters of credit or swing line loans outstanding will reduce the amount available under the Amended Credit Agreement. The Company had no outstanding letters of credit issued under the Amended Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. F-28 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) The U.S. borrowers and guarantors participating in the Amended Credit Agreement also entered into a related amended and restated pledge and security agreement. The amended and restated pledge and security agreement grants a security interest to the lenders in substantially all of the personal property of the Company and its U.S. subsidiaries designated as borrowers to secure their respective obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement, including the stock and membership interests of specified subsidiaries (limited to 66 % of the stock in the case of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries). In addition to the security obligations, all obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by certain of the Company’s subsidiaries. The Amended Credit Agreement restricts, among other things, the amount of dividend payments the Company can make to shareholders. The Amended Credit Agreement contains covenants, that, among other things, (i) prohibit or limit the ability of the borrowers and any material subsidiary to incur additional indebtedness, create liens, pay dividends, make certain types of investments (including acquisitions), enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates, prepay other indebtedness, sell assets, merge with other companies or enter into certain other transactions outside the ordinary course of business, and (ii) require that Gentherm maintain a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio and Consolidated Leverage Ratio (based on consolidated EBITDA for the applicable trailing 12-month period as defined in the Amended Credit Agreement) as of the end of any fiscal quarter. The Amended Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default. As of December 31 , 2020, the Company was in compliance with the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement. Under the Amended Credit Agreement, U.S. Dollar denominated loans bear interest at either a base rate (“Base Rate Loans”) or Eurocurrency rate (“Eurocurrency Rate Loans”), plus a margin (“Applicable Rate”). The rate for Base Rate Loans is equal to the highest of the Federal Funds Rate ( 0.09 % at December 31, 2020) plus 0.50 %, Bank of America’s prime rate ( 3.25 % at December 31, 2020), or the Eurocurrency rate plus 1.00 %. The rate for Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in U.S. Dollars is equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate ( 0.14 % at December 31, 2020). All loans denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar must be Eurocurrency Rate Loans. Interest is payable at least quarterly. The Applicable Rate varies based on the Consolidated Leverage Ratio reported by the Company. As long as the Company is not in default of the terms and conditions of the Amended Credit Agreement, the lowest and highest possible Applicable Rate is 1.25 % and 2.25 %, respectively, for Eurocurrency Rate Loans and 0.25 % and 1.25 %, respectively, for Base Rate Loans. In March 2020, the Company increased its borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement by $ 169,546 as a safeguard to increase its cash position and provide additional financial flexibility due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The proceeds were used for working capital and for other general corporate purposes permitted by the Amended Credit Agreement. After the drawdown in March 2020 and through December 31, 2020, the Company repaid a net amount of $ 41,180 of the amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, inclusive of the net new borrowings in 2020, $ 186,184 was outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement. In January 2021, the Company repaid an additional $ 80,000 of the amounts outstanding under the Amended Credit Agreement. Borrowing availability is subject to, among other things, the Company’s compliance with the minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio and Consolidated Leverage Ratio as of the end of any fiscal quarter . Based upon consolidated EBITDA for the trailing twelve months calculated for purposes of the Consolidated Leverage Ratio, $ 288,776 remained available as of December 31, 2020 for additional borrowings under the Amended Credit Agreement subject to specified conditions that Gentherm currently satisfies. In connection with the Amended Credit Agreement, the Company incurred debt issuance costs of $ 1,278 which have been capitalized and will be amortized into interest expense over the term of the credit facility. DEG Vietnam Loan The Company also has a fixed interest rate loan with the German Investment Corporation (“DEG”), a subsidiary of KfW Banking Group, a Germany government-owned development bank. The fixed interest rate senior loan agreement with DEG was used to finance the construction and set up of the Vietnam production facility (“DEG Vietnam Loan”). The DEG Vietnam Loan is subject to semi-annual principal payments that began November, 2017 and will end May, 2023 . Under the terms of the DEG Vietnam Loan, the Company must maintain a minimum Enhanced Equity Ratio, as defined by the DEG Vietnam Loan agreement, based on the financial statements of Gentherm’s wholly owned subsidiary, Gentherm Vietnam Co. Ltd. As of December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with all terms as outlined in the DEG Vietnam Loan.

Actuarial gains or losses are amortized to Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income based on the average future life of the Plan using the corridor method. Prior service cost is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income. F-31 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Plan assets – German Plan Plan assets are comprised of Gentherm GmbH’s pension insurance policies and are pledged to the beneficiaries of the German Plan. A market valuation technique, based on observable underlying insurance charges, is used to determine the fair value of the pension plan assets (Level 2). The expected return on plan assets assumption used to calculate Gentherm GmbH’s pension benefit obligation was determined using actual returns realized on plan assets in the prior year. Other assets Although the U.S. Plan is not funded, the Company has established a separate trust having the sole purpose of paying benefits under the U.S. Plan. The only asset of the trust is a corporate-owned life insurance policy (“COLI”). The COLI is valued at fair value using quoted prices listed in active markets (Level 1). The policy value of the COLI was $ 2,966 and $ 2,592 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and is included in Other non-current assets in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Contributions We do no t expect contributions to be paid to the U.S. Plan or the German Plan during the next fiscal year. The schedule of future expected pension payments is as follows: Projected Pension Benefit Payments Year U.S Plan German Plan 2021 $ 342 $ 296 2022 342 291 2023 342 301 2024 342 295 2025 342 287 2026-2030 1,710 2,886 Total $ 3,420 $ 4,356 Defined contribution plans The Company also sponsors defined contribution plans for eligible employees. On a discretionary basis, the Company matches a portion of the employee contributions and or makes additional discretionary contributions. Gentherm recognized costs of $ 1,275 , $ 1,384 and $ 1,471 related to contributions to its defined contribution plans during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Note 11 — Commitments and Contingencies The Company may be subject to various legal actions and claims in the ordinary course of its business, including those arising out of breach of contracts, product warranties, product liability, intellectual property rights, environmental matters, regulatory matters and employment-related matters. The Company establishes accruals for matters which it believes that losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these matters, the Company is of the opinion that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial position. Purchase commitments for materials, supplies, services and property and equipment as part of the normal course of business was immaterial as of December 31, 2020. Product liability and warranty reserves are recorded separately from legal reserves, as described below. F-32 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Product Liability and Warranty Matters The Company accrues warranty obligations for products sold based on management estimates of future failure rates and current claim cost experience, with support from the sales, engineering, quality and legal functions. Using historical information available to the Company, including claims already filed by customers, the warranty accrual is adjusted quarterly to reflect management’s best estimate of future claims. The Company maintains liability insurance coverage at levels based on commercial norms and historical claims experience. The Company can provide no assurances that it will not experience material claims in the future or that it will not incur significant costs to defend such claims. The following is a reconciliation of the changes in accrued warranty costs: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 Balance at beginning of year $ 4,596 $ 4,514 Warranty claims paid ( 2,598 ) ( 584 ) Warranty expense for products shipped during the current period 1,223 2,370 Adjustments to warranty estimates from prior periods ( 893 ) ( 1,660 ) Acquisition of business — 21 Adjustments due to currency translation 63 ( 65 ) Balance at end of year $ 2,391 $ 4,596 Employees Approximately 25 % of the Company’s workforce are members of industrial trade unions and are employed under the terms of various labor agreements. None of these agreements expire in 2021 . Note 12 — Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share are computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the period. The Company’s diluted earnings per share give effect to all potential shares of Common Stock outstanding during a period that do not have an anti-dilutive impact to the calculation. In computing the diluted earnings per share, the treasury stock method is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be issued from the exercise of Common Stock equivalents. The following table illustrates earnings per share and the weighted average shares outstanding used in calculating basic and diluted earnings per share: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Net income $ 59,690 $ 48,866 $ 41,899 Basic weighted average shares of Common Stock outstanding 32,666,025 33,120,076 35,920,782 Dilutive effect of stock options, restricted stock awards and restricted stock units 362,079 177,513 256,362 Diluted weighted average shares of Common Stock outstanding 33,028,104 33,297,589 36,177,144 Basic earnings per share $ 1.83 $ 1.48 $ 1.17 Diluted earnings per share $ 1.81 $ 1.47 $ 1.16 F-33 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) The following table represents Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of certain stock options that have been excluded from the diluted earnings calculation because the effect of their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.

Note 13 —Financial Instruments Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash As of December 31, 2019, the Company had cash that was legally restricted as to use or withdrawal. A reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets to cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows is as follows: As of December 31, 2020 2019 Cash and cash equivalents presented in the consolidated balance sheets $ 268,345 $ 50,443 Restricted cash — 2,505 Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows $ 268,345 $ 52,948 Derivative Financial Instruments The Company is exposed to various market risks including, but not limited to, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Market risks for changes in interest rates relate primarily to its debt obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement. Foreign currency exchange risks are attributable to sales to foreign customers and purchases from foreign suppliers not denominated in a location’s functional currency, foreign plant operations, intercompany indebtedness, intercompany investments and include exposures to the Euro, Mexican Peso, Canadian Dollar, Hungarian Forint, Macedonian Denar, Ukrainian Hryvnia, Japanese Yen, Chinese Renminbi, Korean Won and Vietnamese Dong. The Company regularly enters into derivative contracts with the objective of managing its financial and operational exposure arising from these risks by offsetting gains and losses on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the financial instruments used to hedge them. The maximum length of time over which the Company hedges its exposure to foreign currency exchange risks is twelve months . The Company had foreign currency derivative contracts with a notional value of $ 13,299 and $ 14,449 outstanding at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The principal currency hedged by the Company was the Mexican Peso. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. The Company’s hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedge, and hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions both at the inception of a hedge and on an ongoing basis to be designated for hedge accounting treatment. For derivative contracts which can be classified as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is recorded to Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets. When the underlying hedge transaction is realized, the gain or loss included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss is recorded in earnings in the consolidated statements of income on the same line as the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. The Company records the ineffective portion of foreign currency hedging instruments, if any, to Foreign currency gain (loss) in the consolidated statements of income. F-34 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) The Company uses an income approach to value derivative instruments, analyzing quoted market prices to calculate the forward values and then discounts such forward values to the present value using benchmark rates at commonly quoted intervals for the instrument’s full term. Information related to the recurring fair value measurement of derivative financial instruments in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020 is as follows: Asset Derivatives Liability Derivatives Hedge Designation Fair Value Hierarchy Balance Sheet Location Fair Value Balance Sheet Location Fair Value Net Asset/ (Liabilities) Foreign currency derivatives Cash flow hedge Level 2 Other current assets $ 1,513 Other current liabilities $ — $ 1,513 Information related to the recurring fair value measurement of derivative financial instruments in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 is as follows: Asset Derivatives Liability Derivatives Hedge Designation Fair Value Hierarchy Balance Sheet Location Fair Value Balance Sheet Location Fair Value Net Asset/ (Liabilities) Foreign currency derivatives Cash flow hedge Level 2 Other current assets $ 1,242 Other current liabilities $ — $ 1,242 Information related to the effect of derivative instruments in the consolidated statements of income is as follows: Year Ended December 31, Location 2020 2019 Foreign currency derivatives Cost of sales $ ( 1,629 ) $ 1,976 Other comprehensive income 272 1,151 Foreign currency loss ( 118 ) ( 46 ) Total foreign currency derivatives $ ( 1,475 ) $ 3,081 The Company did no t incur any hedge ineffectiveness during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. F-35 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Note 14 — Fair Value Measurement Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Fair value measurements are based on one or more of the following three valuation techniques: Market : This approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. Income : This approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present value amount based on current market expectations. Cost : This approach is based on the amount that would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset (replacement cost). The Company uses the following fair value hierarchy to measure fair value into three broad levels, which are described below: Level 1 : Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs. Level 2 : Inputs, other than quoted market prices included in Level 1, that are observable either directly or indirectly for the asset or liability. Level 3 : Unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs. Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Except for derivative financial instruments (see Note 13), pension plan assets (see Note 10) and a corporate owned life insurance policy (see Note 10), the Company has no material financial assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value at December 31, 2020 and 2019. In determining fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible and also considers counterparty credit risk in its assessment of fair value. Items Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis The Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a non-recurring basis. As these nonrecurring fair value measurements are generally determined using unobservable inputs, these fair value measurements are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. As further described in “Note 4, “Acquisitions and Divestitures"", the Company utilized a third-party to assist in the Level 3 fair value estimates of $ 4,380 related to other intangible assets. The estimated fair values of these assets were based on third-party valuations and management’s estimates, generally utilizing the income approach. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no additional significant assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Items Not Carried at Fair Value The Company uses an income valuation technique to measure the fair values of its debt instruments by converting amounts of future cash flows to a single present value amount using rates based on current market expectations (Level 2 inputs). As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the carrying values of the Company’s Credit Agreement indebtedness were not materially different than their estimated fair values because the interest rates on variable rate debt approximated rates currently available to the Company (see Note 9). Discount rates used to measure the fair value of Gentherm’s DEG Vietnam Loan are based on quoted swap rates. As of December 31, 2020, the carrying value of the DEG Vietnam Loan was $ 6,250 , as compared to an estimated fair value of $ 6,360 . As of December 31, 2019, the carrying value of the DEG Vietnam Loan was $ 8,750 as compared to an estimated fair value of $ 8,785 .

Stock Repurchase Program In December 2016, the Board of Directors of Gentherm Incorporated (“Board of Directors”) authorized a three-year , $ 100,000 stock repurchase program (“Stock Repurchase Program”). In June 2018, the Board of Directors authorized an increase and extension in the Stock Repurchase Program to $ 300,000 , and extended the Stock Repurchase Program until December 2020 . In March 2020, the Company suspended its Stock Repurchase Program in order to preserve liquidity. On December 11, 2020, the Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program (the “2020 Stock Repurchase Program”) to commence upon expiration of the prior stock repurchase program on December 15, 2020. Under the 2020 Stock Repurchase Program, the Company is authorized to repurchase up to $ 150,000 of its issued and outstanding common stock over a three-year period, expiring December 15, 2023 . Repurchases may be made, from time to time, in amounts and at prices the Company deems appropriate, subject to market conditions, applicable legal requirements, debt covenants and other considerations. Any such repurchases may be executed using open market purchases, privately negotiated agreements or other transactions. Repurchases may be funded from cash on hand, available borrowings or proceeds from potential debt or other capital markets sources. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company repurchased approximately $ 9,092 of shares under the Stock Repurchase Program with an average price paid per share of $36.93. The Stock Repurchase Program had $ 74,226 of repurchase authorization remaining at expiration. The Company did not make any repurchases under either stock repurchase program during the second, third and fourth quarters of 2020.

Note 17 — Accounting for Stock Based Compensation On May 16, 2013, the Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved the Gentherm Incorporated 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2013 Plan”), covering 3,500,000 shares of our Common Stock. The 2013 Plan was amended on May 19, 2017 to increase the number of available shares by 2,000,000 and further amended on May 21, 2020 to increase the number of available shares by 2,450,000 . The 2013 Plan permits the granting of various awards including stock options (including both nonqualified options and incentive options), stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock and restricted stock units, performance shares and certain other awards to employees, outside directors and consultants and advisors of the Company. All shares of our Common Stock that remained available for issuance under the Amended and Restated 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2006 Plan”) and the Gentherm Incorporated 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2011 Plan), were reduced to zero ; however, some options under the 2006 Plan are still outstanding. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had an aggregate of 3,021,451 shares of Common Stock available to issue under the 2013 Plan. All equity plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board. During the three-year period ended December 31, 2020, the Company has outstanding stock options, SARs, restricted stock awards and restricted stock units to employees, directors and consultants. These awards become available to the recipient upon the satisfaction of a vesting condition, either based on a period of service or based on the performance of a specific achievement. For equity-based awards with a service condition, the requisite service period typically ranges between three to four years for employees and consultants and one year for directors. As of December 31, 2020, there were 315,834 performance-based restricted stock units (“PSUs”) outstanding. These awards cliff vest after three-years based on the Company’s achievement of either a target return on invested capital ratio (“ROIC”), as defined in the award agreement, for a specified fiscal year, or the Company’s common stock market price returning a target total shareholder return (“TSR”), as defined, during a specific three-year measurement period. Approximately one-half of the PSUs are earned based on the ROIC condition, while the other one-half are earned based on the TSR condition. In each case, awards will be earned at 50 % of the target number of shares for achieving a minimum threshold or up to 200 % of the target number of shares for exceeding the target, with a linear adjustment between threshold and target or between target and stretch performance goals. All other outstanding, unvested equity-based awards were service based. Equity-based award vesting may be accelerated at the discretion of the Board under conditions specified in the applicable plan. F-39 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Under FASB ASC Topic 718, the provisions of the PSUs that vest upon the achievement of relative TSR are considered a market condition, and therefore the effect of that market condition is reflected in the grant date fair value for this portion award. A third party was engaged to complete a “Monte Carlo simulation” to account for the market condition. That simulation takes into account the beginning stock price of our common stock, the expected volatilities for the TSR comparator group, the expected volatilities for the Company’s stock price, correlation coefficients, the expected risk-free rate of return and the expected dividend yield of the Company and the comparator group. The single grant-date fair value computed by this valuation method is recognized by the Company in accounting for the awards regardless of the actual future outcome of the relative TSR feature. The grant date fair value of the other PSUs and RSUs are calculated as the closing price of our common stock as quoted on Nasdaq on the grant date multiplied by the number of shares subject to the award. ROIC is considered a performance condition and the grant-date fair value for ROIC PSUs corresponds with management's expectation of the probable outcome of the performance condition as of the grant date. Total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and PSUs outstanding under all of the Company’s equity plans was $ 13,604 and $ 13,168 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of two years . Compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $ 14,323 , $ 8,589 and $ 12,177 , respectively, and the related deferred tax benefit was $ 3,002 , $ 1,573 and $ 2,434 , respectively. If Gentherm were to realize expired shared-based payment arrangements, they would be reported as a forfeit in the activity roll forward tables below. Stock Options The following table summarizes stock option activity during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018: Options Shares Weighted-Average Exercise Price Weighted-Average Remaining Contractual Term Aggregate Intrinsic Value Outstanding at December 31, 2017 2,652,142 $ 35.34 4.76 $ 6,964 Granted — — Exercised ( 615,358 ) 24.01 Forfeited ( 383,784 ) 39.59 Outstanding at December 31, 2018 1,653,000 $ 38.53 4.28 $ 3,610 Granted — — Exercised ( 428,250 ) 38.66 Forfeited ( 355,750 ) 39.99 Outstanding at December 31, 2019 869,000 $ 37.87 3.51 $ 5,172 Granted — — Exercised ( 434,250 ) 38.12 Forfeited ( 6,750 ) 38.05 Outstanding at December 31, 2020 428,000 $ 37.61 3.20 $ 11,815 Exercisable at December 31, 2020 338,625 $ 37.87 3.11 $ 9,261 The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model in order to measure the compensation cost associated with the award. This model incorporates certain assumptions for inputs including a risk-free interest rate, expected dividend yield of the underlying Common Stock, expected option life and expected volatility in the market value of the underlying Common Stock. F-40 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of the Company’s Common Stock. The Company uses historical exercise data and several other factors in developing an assumption for the expected lives of stock options, including the average holding period of outstanding options and their remaining terms. The risk-free interest rate is based upon quoted market yields for United States Treasury debt securities. The expected dividend yield is based upon the Company’s history of having never issued a dividend, the limitations to issue a dividend under terms of the Amended Credit Agreement and management’s current expectation regarding future dividends. We do not expect any of the options granted to be forfeited for purposes of computing fair value. There were no stock options granted during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $ 5,317 , $ 1,681 and $ 5,061 , respectively.

These earnings will be primarily treated as previously taxed income from either the one-time transition tax or global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) provision, or they will be offset with a 100 % dividend received deduction. However, the Company continues to provide a deferred tax liability for foreign withholding tax that will be incurred with respect to the undistributed foreign earnings that are not permanently reinvested. F-43 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) The deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities and related valuation allowance were comprised of the following as of December 31, 2020 and 2019: December 31, 2020 2019 Deferred tax assets: Net operating losses $ 22,658 $ 17,881 Intangible assets 29,145 33,743 Research and development credits 10,773 9,752 Depreciation 7,426 7,223 Valuation reserves and accrued liabilities 7,131 7,196 Stock compensation 4,200 3,485 Defined benefit obligation 1,974 2,027 Inventory 1,571 1,284 Other credits 12,068 11,753 Unrealized foreign currency exchange loss 1,431 — Other 64 113 Total deferred tax asset 98,441 94,457 Valuation allowance ( 17,197 ) ( 17,316 ) Deferred tax liabilities: Unrealized foreign currency exchange gains — ( 674 ) Undistributed profits of subsidiary ( 5,727 ) ( 4,629 ) Property and equipment ( 2,758 ) ( 3,366 ) Other ( 572 ) ( 733 ) Total deferred tax liability ( 9,057 ) ( 9,402 ) Net deferred tax asset $ 72,187 $ 67,739 Reconciliations between the statutory Federal income tax rate and the effective rate of income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 are as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Statutory Federal income tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 % Increase (decrease) resulting from: Change in valuation allowance ( 0.4 )% 11.5 % ( 6.6 )% Effect of different tax rates of foreign jurisdictions ( 4.7 )% ( 24.8 )% ( 6.6 )% Audit settlements and statute expirations 3.9 % 0.6 % ( 1.1 )% US tax reform items 2.5 % 4.3 % 10.8 % Research and development credits ( 1.4 )% ( 2.3 )% ( 2.5 )% Non-deductible expenses 2.1 % 2.1 % 3.4 % Foreign, state and local tax, net of Federal benefit 1.4 % 1.7 % 1.8 % Tax effects of intercompany transfers 1.4 % 1.5 % 0.8 % Undistributed profit of subsidiaries 0.9 % 1.2 % 1.2 % Other 0.1 % 0.6 % 5.7 % Effective rate 26.8 % 17.4 % 27.9 % The Company has Net Operating Loss (“NOL”) carryforwards as follows: Jurisdiction Amount as of December 31, 2020 Years of Expiration U.S. state income tax $ 106,987 2021-2040 Foreign $ 7,441 2021-2025 Foreign $ 161,851 Never F-44 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) We have incurred NOLs in various states associated with the benefits of the state dividends received reduction along with the foreign royalty exclusion. The state NOL carryforwards expire at various dates from 2021 to 2040 . Management has concluded that it is more likely than not that a majority of these NOLs will not be utilized, and thus has not recognized the benefit of these NOLs. At December 31, 2020, certain non-U.S. subsidiaries had net operating loss carryforwards totaling $ 169,293 . This amount included $ 7,441 in NOLs that expire at various dates from 2021 through 2025 and the remaining $ 161,851 have no expiration date . The Company had a valuation allowance recorded against $ 5,787 of the total non-U.S. subsidiaries’ net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2020. The Company is subject to taxation in the United States and various state and foreign jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2020, the Company was no longer subject to U.S. Federal examinations by tax authorities for tax years before 2016 and was no longer subject to foreign examinations by tax authorities for tax years before 2014. During 2015, to entice the Company to construct a new facility in North Macedonia, the government of North Macedonia granted the Company a tax holiday, in combination with state aid, which released the Company from the obligation to pay corporate income taxes for a ten year period, subject to certain limitations. The amount of corporate income tax savings realized by the Company as a result of this tax holiday during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, was zero as a result of operating losses generated during previous periods. The aggregate dollar effect and per share effect of the corporate income tax holiday during 2020, 2019 and 2018 was, therefore, immaterial. At December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the Company had total unrecognized tax benefits of $ 4,967 , $ 3,795 and $ 2,819 , respectively, all of which, if recognized, would affect the effective income tax rates. The reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Balance at beginning of year $ 3,795 $ 2,819 $ 3,812 Additions based on tax position related to current year 1,489 661 221 Additions based on tax position related to prior year 179 352 423 Reductions from settlements and statute of limitation expiration ( 650 ) — ( 1,469 ) Effect of foreign currency translation 154 ( 37 ) ( 168 ) Balance at end of year $ 4,967 $ 3,795 $ 2,819 The Company classifies income tax-related penalties and net interest as income tax expense. In the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, income tax related interest and penalties were not material. It is reasonably possible that audit settlements, the conclusions of current examinations or the expiration of the statute of limitations in several jurisdictions could impact the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits. If recognized, all the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits would affect the Company’s effective tax rate. Note 19 –Revenue Recognition The principal activity from which the Company generates its revenue is the manufacturing of production parts for automotive OEMs and automotive suppliers, as well as the sale of medical products and equipment primarily through distributor and group purchasing organization agreements. Contract Balances We record a receivable when revenue is recognized at the time of invoicing and unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. For contracts where control of the goods or service is transferred to the customer over time, or whose terms F-45 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) required the customer to make milestone payments throughout the fulfillment period, the timing of revenue recognition is likely to differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. Most of Gentherm’s unearned revenue pertains to LTAs containing a material right. In the early periods of an LTA containing a material right, when payments collected from the customer are greater than the standalone selling price of the production parts, revenue associated with the material right is deferred. In future periods, when amounts collected from customers as payment is less than the standalone selling price of the production parts delivered, the deferred revenue is reversed into revenue. For LTAs containing a material right and, thus, the timing of revenue recognition is likely to differ from the timing of invoicing to customer, the aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to material rights that remained unsatisfied under LTAs as of December 31, 2020 was $ 181 within our Automotive segment. We expect to recognize into revenue 32 % of this balance in 2021, 48 % in 2022 and the remaining 20 % in 2023 . Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represent contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. Note 20 — Segment Reporting Segment information is used by management for making operating decisions for the Company. Management evaluates the performance of the Company’s segments based primarily on operating income or loss. The Company’s reportable segments are as follows: • Automotive — this segment represents the design, development, manufacturing and sales of automotive climate comfort systems, automotive cable systems, battery performance solutions, and automotive electronic and software systems. • Medical — this segment represents the combined results from our Medical business, GPT (through October 1, 2019), CSZ-IC (through February 1, 2019) and non-automotive expenses from Gentherm’s advanced research and development division (through December 31, 2019). The operating results from these businesses and division are presented together as one reporting segment because of their historical joint concentration on identifying new markets and product applications based on thermal management technologies. With the remaining temperature management business being the primary focus now in this segment, we have renamed it to reflect the strategic direction of this segment. • Corporate — includes corporate costs, selling, general and administrative costs and acquisition transaction costs. This segment has been renamed this year to better align with the costs allocated to this segment. It was previously named ‘Reconciling Items’. In 2018 and 2019, our Industrial reporting segment represented the combined results from our patient temperature management systems business, GPT (through its divestiture on October 1, 2019), CSZ-IC (through its divestiture on February 1, 2019) and non-automotive expenses from our advanced research and development division (through December 31, 2019). The operating results from these businesses and division previously were presented together as one reporting segment because of their historical joint concentration on identifying new markets and product applications based on thermal management technologies. In 2020, the Industrial reporting segment was renamed the Medical reporting segment to reflect the patient temperature management business as the focus and strategic direction of this segment. Also, during 2020, the advanced research and development costs not associated with the Medical segment were moved to the Automotive segment, as this organization now primarily supports the Automotive related development activities following the divestitures of GPT and CSZ-IC. For comparability to the prior years, we have moved the portion of advanced research and development costs to the Automotive segment that were focused on technologies related to automotive in 2018 and 2019 in both the Depreciation and amortization and Operating income (loss) lines in the table below.

Business Strategy Across the globe, we produce and deliver advanced thermal solutions for automotive and patient thermal management markets that positively impact lives. To achieve our goals and capitalize on opportunities within the automotive and patient thermal management markets, we launched in mid-2018 and continue to implement four primary strategies: Focus Growth The focused growth strategy includes four key goals: • Accelerate growth in our core automotive climate and comfort businesses by leveraging human thermophysiology to offer personalized passenger comfort and improve efficiency; • Introduce an innovative microclimate solution, ClimateSense TM , which offers personalized thermal comfort in one intelligent and integrated system; • Drive battery thermal management with increased focus on active battery heating and cooling, passive battery cooling, battery heaters, and cell connecting board solutions; and • Expand patient thermal management solutions that leverage synergies from our automotive climate and comfort businesses. These areas of the focused growth strategy are underpinned and enabled by our electronics and software systems business. Extend Technology Leadership We continue to expand our technology leadership with focused investments in key core technologies and competencies, including thermophysiology, software and electronics, simulation, thermal engines and integration. 4 Expand Gross Margin and Return on Invested Capital We are strengthening our operational discipline and execution to expand gross margin and return on invested capital. This strategy centers around building a culture of performance that includes a focus on high-return growth opportunities, and the Fit-for-Growth cost rationalization program. It also included the divestiture of non-core investments, which was completed in 2019. During 2018, we initiated this strategy through the sale of our battery management systems division located in Irvine, California and the site consolidation of its advanced research and development operations, which resulting in vacating two lease facilities in Azusa, California. Further, we exited several product categories including furniture, aviation, battery management electronics, industrial battery packs, automotive thermoelectric generators and other non-core electronics. Additionally, we undertook restructuring actions to reduce global overhead costs to improve selling, general and administrative expense. Optimize Capital Allocation We are optimizing our capital allocation to drive shareholder returns, including through stock repurchases, while also allowing us to reinvest in our business to drive continued growth. We make investments to grow our businesses through capital expenditure projects, focused research and development investments, and evaluate acquisition opportunities that will enhance other business strategies. Recent Acquisitions and Dispositions As part of our plan to make strategic acquisitions and dispositions, we have completed the following significant transactions since 2018: On April 1, 2019, Gentherm acquired Stihler Electronic GmbH (“Stihler”), a leading developer and manufacturer of patient and blood temperature management systems, for a purchase price of $15.5 million, net of cash acquired. On February 1, 2019, we completed the sale of CSZ-IC and the CSZ headquarters facility to Weiss Technik North America, Inc. for total cash proceeds of $47.5 million. On October 1, 2019, we completed the divestiture of GPT. Both businesses were classified as held-for-sale as of December 31, 2018. See Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the Company’s recent acquisitions and divestitures. Research and Development Our research and development activities are an essential part of our efforts to develop new or improved innovative products. Through both internal and external research and development programs, we are working to develop a comprehensive knowledge of thermal management systems that can demonstrate functionality and performance. These activities are critical to optimizing energy and production efficiencies, improving effectiveness in our products, and minimizing the cost to integrate our products with those of our customers. We perform advanced research and development on thermal management systems, including those that utilize new proprietary comfort software algorithms, to enhance the efficiency and functionality of our automotive heating and cooling products. We believe there are substantial opportunities to integrate innovative thermal management systems into current and future product applications. Research and development is conducted around the globe, predominately at our world headquarters in Northville, Michigan, our Technology Center in Farmington Hills, Michigan and our European research facilities in Odelzhausen, Germany. Additional product development is performed at all of our manufacturing facilities to support customers. We believe the localized development model employed at our global design and manufacturing facilities improves our ability to effectively serve our customers and increases our innovative capacity. 5 Core Technologies Gentherm’s expertise in thermal management is focused on two general areas: managing the thermal conditions of people and objects. Thermoelectric Technologies Many of our thermal products manage the thermal conditions of people and objects using our internally developed advanced thermoelectric device technology (“TED”). A TED is a solid-state circuit that has the capability to produce both hot and cold thermal conditions by use of the Peltier effect. The advantages of advanced TEDs over conventional compressed gas systems are that they are environmentally friendly and less complex as they have no moving parts and are compact and light weight. Over the last 18 years, our work on this technology has yielded improvements in areas of functionality, efficiency, durability and performance. Resistive Heaters Resistive heater technologies are comprised of wire, carbon fiber or positive thermal coefficient (“PTC”) heating elements which quickly and effectively deliver heat to people and objects. Wire heating elements are designed from stainless steel, copper, our proprietary carbon fiber woven lattice technology called Carbotex® or printed circuit PTC heaters based on the specifications for a particular product application. ClimateSense TM ClimateSense is an integrated comfort system designed to create a personalized microclimate for passengers using localized convective, conductive and radiative heating and cooling products. Using automatic regulation technology, ClimateSense offers the ability to personalize and improve overall occupant thermal comfort, improve time to comfort with (all-electric) pre-conditioning, provide comfort with less energy consumption thereby lowering carbon dioxide emissions by conventional internal combustion and hybrid powertrains, and extending range for electrified powertrains through a reduction in central HVAC system usage. Electronics Gentherm manufactures and supplies electronics to our core climate comfort solution products. We also supply value-added electronic products to third parties for adjacent areas within the automotive interior. Gentherm also manufacturers and supplies electronic control units for memory seat modules that include electric motor position sensing technology. Automotive Cable Systems Gentherm produces automotive cable systems used to connect automotive components to sources of power. The automotive cable systems are an important element in the production of many of our products and form a significant component in how we generate value to our customers by being an efficient, low-cost and high-quality manufacturer. We offer cable systems as integrated parts of our products and also as stand-alone components for other automotive applications, such as oxygen sensors. Our cable systems business includes both ready-made individual cables and ready-to-install cable networks. Sales of products that utilize our automotive cable systems technology represented 9% of our total product revenues for years ending December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Air Moving Devices Our highly durable and quiet air moving devices, including our proprietary blower and fan designs, are essential to all of our products that require air movement. 6 Products Climate Comfort Solutions – Seat Comfort Climate Control Seat ® (“CCS”) Our CCS products utilize exclusive patented technology to regulate temperature and enhance the comfort of vehicle passengers. The most advanced CCS models use one or more TEDs to generate heating or cooling depending upon the direction of the current applied to the device. A TED is the heart of a compact heat pump used in our active CCS products. Air is forced through the heat pump and thermally conditioned in response to electronic switch input from the seat occupant. The conditioned air circulates by one of our specially designed air moving devices through a proprietary air distribution system installed in the seat cushion and seat back, so that the seat surface can be heated or cooled. Each seat has individual electronic controls to adjust the level of heating or cooling. Active CCS products improve comfort compared with conventional air conditioners by focusing cooling directly on the passenger through the seat rather than waiting until ambient air cools the seat surface beneath the passenger. A heated and ventilated variant of the CCS utilizes ambient cabin air to provide cooling comfort instead of a TED to actively cool the seat. In the heating mode, the vent-only system is supplemented with resistive heating elements. Heated and ventilated CCS products provide a lower level of cooling capability than our active CCS solution, but at a lower price. By offering different models of the CCS product, our customers have the opportunity to purchase a wider range of climate control products at different price points. Sales of CCS products contributed 37%, 36% and 39% to our total product revenues for the years ending December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Heated Seat Heated seats, based on our resistive heater core technology, are seamlessly integrated into automotive seat designs, and are constructed using materials that offer the best capacity, installation characteristics and durability. Our capabilities allow customers to choose among a variety of resistive heater materials based on their individual vehicle specifications. Sales of heated seat products contributed 29%, 29% and 31% to our total product revenues for the years ending December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Neck Climate Control Systems Neck climate control systems ventilate warm or temperature-controlled air directly onto the passenger’s neck area. The system combines electronics, air moving device technologies and a heating element into a compact, integrated headrest design that can be adjusted to suit the body size of the passenger. Climate Comfort Solutions – Surface Climate Control Systems Heated Steering Wheel Heated steering wheels deliver heating comfort to automobile drivers through resistive elements. This product can be applied to both leather and wood steering wheels. A solution for drivers in cold and mild weather climates, the heated steering wheel is designed for the global automotive market. Heated Surfaces Gentherm’s thermally conductive or radiative surfaces, such as door panel armrest and center console armrest products, are powered by our core technologies. The system is thermally managed by a heating control system which can be discretely located in the door panel or seat of the vehicle. Heated door panels and armrests complement our climate-controlled seat and steering wheel products and provide a superior level of thermal comfort to the driving experience. 7 Battery Sub-Systems Thermoelectric Battery Thermal Management (BTM) Thermal management is critically important for the long-term operation of advanced automotive batteries. The expansion of electrified vehicle applications, such as 48-volt electrical networks, start-stop systems, regenerative braking systems and other micro-hybrid battery implementations, have drastically increased the demand for BTM systems solutions which enable wider operating temperature ranges, enhanced driving range and prolonged life of the battery. Gentherm’s BTM system can provide precision battery cooling on pack or cell-level using patented TED technology. The BTM system maintains the temperature of the lithium-ion battery or other advanced chemistry battery within an acceptable temperature range without the use of chilled liquids or refrigerant loops, making it a light weight, highly scalable, compact solution ideal for automotive applications. Gentherm’s proprietary BTM system is compact and energy efficient, resulting in a minimal energy budget, which is important for an electrified vehicle. We are currently working with original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) to secure more production contracts. Cell Connecting Systems Cell connecting systems provide secure connections between advanced automotive batteries to transmit a continuous flow of information about battery temperature and cell voltage during the charging and discharging process to monitor battery system performance. Gentherm has developed a range of cell connecting system products, including flexible foil cell connecting boards that offer improved packaging, weight and functionality. Climate Comfort Solutions – Thermal Convenience TrueTherm TM Cup Holder The TrueTherm cup holder applies Gentherm’s patented TED technologies to keep beverages of automobile drivers and passengers either warm or cool. We have developed a range of cup holder models with varying degrees of functionality, designed to be packaged in multiple configurations to accommodate different console environments. Our dual independent design provides separate temperature settings in each holder allowing the driver and passenger to individually maintain a heated or cooled beverage. TrueTherm TM Storage Unit Gentherm’s TrueTherm storage units provide for food or beverage cooling for the global automotive market. Using patented TED or refrigeration technologies, the TrueTherm cool storage unit provides temperature control independently from a vehicle’s heating and air conditioning system. It can be custom designed to accommodate tight interior spaces, such as the front floor console of a sport utility vehicle (SUV) and provide additional cooling capacity to those who have long work commutes or transport multiple passengers. Patient Temperature Management Systems Gentherm provides a full line of patient temperature management systems across multiple product categories addressing the needs of hyper-hypothermia therapy in intensive care, normothermia in surgical procedures, and additional warming/cooling therapies utilized in acute care, ambulatory, clinics and home health. Our core brands include Blanketrol® hyper-hypothermia system, WarmAir®/FilteredFlo® convective warming system, Electri-Cool®/Micro-Temp® localized cooling/warming systems, Hemotherm® cardiovascular cooling/warming system and our recent launch of our next generation cardiovascular cooling/warming system utilized to deliver precise blood temperature control during cardiopulmonary by-pass and other related cardiovascular procedures. We aspire to have innovative patient temperature management product offerings coupled with clinical education enabling our customers to have enhanced patient outcomes and improved efficiencies of care. In April 2019, Gentherm acquired Stihler to further strengthen our patient temperature management offering in the operating room focused on normothermia. The Stihler core brands include ASTOPAD TM patient warming system, ASTOTHERM TM /ASTOFLO TM IV fluid and blood warming systems and ASTODIA TM diaphanoscope for transillumination. The ASTOPAD TM patient warming system utilizes resistive warming technology which is also used in our automotive products. Gentherm is now focused on globalizing the Stihler portfolio and integrating across key sales channels. 8 Marketing, Customers and Sales Our Automotive segment customers include light vehicle OEMs, commercial vehicle OEMs, and first tier (“Tier 1”) suppliers to the automotive OEMs, including automotive seat manufacturers. We also directly supply CCS products to aftermarket seat distributors and installers. The Company’s automotive marketing is directed primarily at automotive manufacturers and their Tier 1 suppliers and focuses on the enhanced value consumers attribute to vehicles with climate comfort products. In many cases, the manufacturers direct us to work with their suppliers to integrate our products into the vehicle’s seat or interior design. These customers will sell our product, as a component of an entire seat or seating system, to automotive OEMs. Once the integration work is complete, prototypes are sent to the manufacturer for evaluation and testing. If a manufacture accepts our product, a program can then be launched for a particular model on a production basis, but it normally takes two to three years from the time a manufacturer decides to include any of our products in a vehicle model to actual production for that vehicle. During this process, we derive funding from prototype sales but obtain no significant revenue until mass production begins. Inherent to the automotive supplier market are costs and commitments that are incurred well in advance of the receipt of orders and resulting revenues from customers. The volume of products we sell is significantly affected by global automotive production levels and the general business conditions in the automotive industry. For 2019, our revenues from sales to our three largest customers, Lear, Adient and Bosch Automotive were $156.9 million, $145.8 million, and $67.2 million, respectively, representing 16%, 15%, and 7% of our product revenues, respectively. Revenues from Adient and Lear represent sales of our climate comfort products. Revenues from Bosch Automotive represent product sales based on our automobile cable system technology and is used primarily in the production of automotive oxygen sensors. The loss of any one of these customers would likely have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and cash flows. However, as noted above, in many cases our approach is to market climate comfort solutions, battery thermal management and cable technology products to the OEMs who then direct their suppliers, such as Adient and Lear, to work with us. It is, therefore, relevant to understand how our revenues are divided among the OEMs, as shown below. Our total product revenues for each of the past three years were divided among automotive OEMs as follows: 2019 2018 2017 General Motors 14 % 14 % 15 % Ford Motor Company 11 % 10 % 11 % Hyundai 9 % 7 % 8 % Fiat Chrysler Automobiles 8 % 8 % 9 % Volkswagen 8 % 9 % 10 % Honda 7 % 6 % 6 % Daimler 6 % 5 % 4 % BMW 6 % 4 % 5 % Mazda 4 % 3 % 2 % Toyota Motor Corporation 4 % 3 % 4 % Renault/Nissan 3 % 4 % 6 % Jaguar/Land Rover 3 % 3 % 3 % Other (including Industrial) 17 % 24 % 17 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % a) Product revenues for all prior periods presented have been adjusted to conform with the current year presentation, related to a reclassification of customer relationship amortization from product revenues to selling, general and administrative expenses. Outsourcing, Production and Suppliers Our global manufacturing and distribution facilities are located close to our key customers. In Europe we operate three manufacturing sites located in Macedonia, Germany and Ukraine and one distribution center located in Hungary. In North America, we operate three manufacturing sites in Mexico, one in the United States and one in Canada. In Asia, we operate three production sites in China and one in Vietnam. 9 We rely on various domestic and foreign vendors and suppliers to supply components for our products through purchase orders, with no guaranteed supply arrangements. Components for certain products, including TEDs, are only available from a limited number of suppliers in the world. The loss of any significant supplier, in the absence of a timely and satisfactory alternative arrangement, or an inability to obtain essential components on reasonable terms or at all, could materially adversely affect our business, operations and cash flows. Our business and operations could also be materially adversely affected by delays in deliveries from our suppliers. Proprietary Rights and Patents The development of new or improved technologies is critical to the execution of our business strategy. Patents obtained for new or improved technologies form an important basis for the success of the Company and underpin the success of our research and development efforts. We have adopted a policy of obtaining, where practical, the exclusive rights to use technology related to our products through patents or licenses for proprietary technologies or processes. We adapt and commercialize such technologies in products for mass production. We also have developed technologies or furthered the development of acquired technologies through internal research and development efforts. As of December 31, 2019, Gentherm held 574 issued patents. Gentherm held 431 patents directed to climate control products and thermoelectric technologies, 92 patents directed at heating elements and technologies, 24 patents directed to medical technologies, 19 patents directed to air moving devices and 8 patents directed to cable and cell connector battery technologies. In furtherance of its Focused Growth strategy, the Company evaluated its patents during 2019 and made strategic decisions to reduce low-value patents and patents unrelated to current or planned business strategies. Competition See further discussion of the risks relating to competition in Item 1A, “Risk Factors”. Gentherm faces competition from other automotive suppliers and, with respect to certain products, from the automobile OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers who produce or have the capability to produce certain products Gentherm supplies. The automotive supply industry competes on the basis of technology, quality, reliability of supply and price. Design, engineering capability and competitive pricing are increasingly important factors. The competitive landscape for Gentherm’s climate comfort solutions and battery sub-systems includes: component specialists, thermal management system suppliers and tier-one suppliers or automobile OEMs with their own integrated solutions. Independent suppliers that represent the principal competitors of Gentherm include I.G. Bauerhin GmbH, Kongsberg Automotive ASA, Lisa DRÄXLMAIER GmbH and ElringKlinger AG. The competitive landscape for patient temperature management systems includes patient thermal management medical device OEMs. The principal competitors of Gentherm include 3M Company Co, Stryker Corporation and Becton, Dickinson and Company. We believe our expertise in core thermal management technologies and occupant thermal comfort, as well as its capability in application specific component design, global footprint and broad product offerings make it well positioned to compete against the traditional thermal management systems suppliers, global tier-one's and component specialists. Seasonality Our principal operations are directly related to the automotive industry. Consequently, we have historically experienced seasonal fluctuations to the extent automotive vehicle production slows, such as in the summer months when many customer plants close for model year changeovers and in December when many customer plants close for the holidays. See Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for selected quarterly financial data. Backlog Our product revenues are generally based upon purchase orders issued by our customers, with updated releases for volume adjustments. As such, we typically do not have a backlog of firm orders at any point in time. Once selected to supply products for a particular platform, we typically supply those products for the platform life, which is normally five to seven years, although there is no guarantee that this will occur. In addition, when we are the incumbent supplier to a given platform, we believe we have a competitive advantage in winning the redesign or replacement platform, although there is no guarantee that this will occur. 10 Employees As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, Gentherm’s employment levels worldwide were as follows: 2019 2018 Mexico 4,130 5,494 Macedonia 1,871 1,771 China 1,812 2,173 Ukraine 1,725 1,959 Vietnam 909 717 United States and Canada 694 1,059 Germany 255 246 Hungary 252 259 Korea 37 39 Japan 23 21 Malta 13 13 United Kingdom 5 4 Total 11,726 13,755 Gentherm retains the services of outside contractors from time to time. Certain of our employees are represented by unions or works councils. We maintain good relations with both our union and non-union employees. I TEM 1A. RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider each of the risks, assumptions, uncertainties and other factors described below and elsewhere in this Report, as well as any amendments or updates reflected in subsequent filings or furnishings with the SEC. We believe these risks, assumptions, uncertainties and other factors, individually or in the aggregate, could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results and could materially and adversely affect our business operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Risks Relating to Our Business The automotive industry, our primary market, is cyclical and a decline in the production levels of our major customers, particularly with respect to models for which we supply significant amounts of product, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our Automotive segment represents 95%, 91% and 89% of our product revenues for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Demand for our automotive products is directly related to automotive vehicle production, which is ultimately dependent on consumer demand for automotive vehicles, and our content per vehicle. Automotive sales and production are cyclical and have been, and we expect will continue to be, materially affected by general economic and industry conditions, labor relations issues, fuel prices, regulatory requirements, government initiatives, trade agreements, the availability and cost of credit for us, customers and consumers and other factors. IHS Markit recently forecasted light vehicle production volumes of 87.2 million units, a decline of 1.9% from 2019. We operate in a highly competitive industry and efforts by our competitors, as well as new non-traditional entrants to the industry could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. The automotive component supply industry is subject to intense competition. Business is typically awarded to the supplier offering the most favorable combination of cost, quality, timely delivery, technological innovation and service. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully with the products of our competitors. Further, our competitors’ efforts to grow market share could exert downward pressure on our product pricing and margins. Many of our competitors are substantially larger in size and have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do, and therefore may be more effective in adapting to customer requirements while being more profitable. In addition, the global automotive industry is experiencing a period of significant technological change. Future automotive vehicle production may be affected by additional industry or consumer behaviors, including the development and use of autonomous and electric vehicles and increasing use of car- and ride-sharing and on-demand transportation as a service, as well as related 11 regulations . The rapidly evolving nature of the markets in which we compete has attracted, and may continue to attract, new entrants, including new entrants from outside the traditional automotive supply industry. Further, in comparison to us, our competitors may foresee the course of market developments more accurately, develop superior products, produce similar products at a lower cost, or adapt quicker to new technologies. If we do not accurately predict, prepare for and respond to new kinds of technological innovations, market developments and changing customer needs, our sales, profitability and long-term competitiveness may be harmed. If we fail to manage our growth effectively or to integrate successfully any new or future business ventures, acquisitions or strategic alliance into our business, our business could be materially adversely harmed. We regularly consider opportunities to pursue business ventures, acquisitions, and strategic alliances that could leverage our products and capabilities, as well as, enhance our customer base, geographic penetration and scale, to complement our current businesses, some of which could be material. Finding and assessing a potential growth opportunity and completing a transaction involves extensive due diligence, management time and expense; however, the amount of information we can obtain about a potential growth opportunity may be limited. Further, we can give no assurance that new business ventures, acquisitions, and strategic alliances will positively affect our financial performance or will perform as planned, including regarding anticipated synergies. We may not be able to successfully assimilate or integrate companies that we acquire, including personnel, financial systems, distribution, operations, internal controls and general operating procedures. Further, for significant transactions, we would expect to incur additional debt, issue equity and/or increase capital expenditures, which may increase leverage risks, result in dilution or reduce capital available for other investments in ongoing operations. If we fail to assimilate or integrate acquired companies successfully, our business, reputation and results of operations could be materially impacted. Likewise, our failure to integrate and manage acquired companies successfully may lead to future impairment of any associated goodwill and intangible asset balances. Given our limited history in the patient temperature management business, the foregoing risks may be heightened due to our lack of experience in integrating similar businesses. As part of the Company’s ongoing Fit-for-Growth initiative, the Company consummated divestitures to eliminate investments in non-core businesses, and the Company may consider strategic dispositions in the future. However, we may not achieve some or all of the targeted results we originally anticipated at the time of disposition, and we may need to provide material transition services or retain material liabilities to complete the transaction, any of which could have an adverse impact on our returns and our overall profitability. The loss or insolvency of any of our principal customers would adversely affect our future results. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our top two customers were Lear and Adient which comprised 16% and 15%, respectively, of our product revenues. We are dependent on the continued growth, viability and financial stability of our customers, as well as the OEMS to which our products are supplied. The loss of any significant portion of our sales to any of our customers would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we have significant receivable balances related to these customers that would be at risk in the event of their bankruptcy or other restructuring. We manage our business based on projected future sales volume, which is highly dependent on information received from customers and general market data, and any inaccuracies or changes in such information could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. We manage our business based upon projected future sales volumes, which are based upon many factors, including awarded business and assumptions of conversion rates thereof, customers’ forecasts and general market data. Our customers generally do not guarantee sales volumes. In addition, awarded business may include business under arrangements that our customers have the right to terminate without penalty at any time. Further, our customers’ forecasts are subject to numerous assumptions, and such forecasts often are/may be changed rapidly with limited notice. Therefore, our actual sales volumes, and thus the ultimate amount of revenue that we derive from such sales, are not committed. If actual production orders from our customers are not consistent with our projected future sales volumes, we could realize substantially less revenue and incur greater expenses over the life of vehicle programs. 12 Our inability to achieve product cost reductions which offset customer-imposed price reductions could adversely affect our financial performance. Downward pricing pressure is customarily applied by automotive manufacturers to the automotive supply chain. Our customer contracts generally provide for annual price reductions over the production life of the vehicle, while requiring us to assume significant responsibility for the design, development and engineering of our products. Prices may also be adjusted on an ongoing basis to reflect changes in product content/costs and other commercial factors. Our inability to achieve product cost reductions that offset customer-imposed price reductions could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our inability to effectively manage the development, timing, quality and costs of new product launches could adversely affect our financial performance. Gentherm is developing and launching new products and related technologies for its battery thermal management and electronic and software systems businesses, and intends to launch other new products in the future. The launch of products employing new technologies is a complex process, the success of which depends on a wide range of factors, including the robustness of our product and manufacturing process development, success in sourcing new components and commodities with suitable suppliers, readiness of our and our suppliers' manufacturing facilities and manufacturing processes, as well as factors related to tooling, equipment, employees, initial product quality and other factors. Given the complexity of new product launches, we may experience difficulties managing product quality, timeliness and associated costs. In addition, new program launches require a significant ramp up of costs. However, our sales related to these new programs generally are dependent upon the timing and success of our customers’ introduction of new vehicles. Our inability to effectively manage the timing, quality and costs of these new program launches could have a materially adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. To the extent we are not able to successfully launch new business, vehicle production at our customers could be significantly delayed or shut down. Such operating failures could result in significant financial penalties to us or a diversion of personnel and financial resources to improving launches rather than investment in continuous process improvement or other growth initiatives, and could result in our customers shifting work away from us to a competitor. Any of the foregoing matters could result in a significant loss of revenue and market shares and could have an adverse effect on our profitability and cash flows. Our ability to market our products successfully depends on acceptance of our products by existing and potential customers and consumers, as well as the success of our customers. We have been, and will continue to be, required to educate potential customers and demonstrate that the merits of our existing products justify the costs associated with them. Similar efforts will be required with existing and potential customers for additional products we develop using technologies we develop or license. Customers will only include our products if there appears to be consumer demand. For our automotive products, we rely on OEMs and applicable dealer networks to market our products to consumers, and we do not have any control over the marketing budget or messaging nor the training of employees and agents regarding our products. Further, OEMs and dealer networks may market products offered by our competitors, including products manufactured by such OEMs. If customers or consumers conclude that temperature control seats or our other automotive products are unnecessary or too expensive or that our competitors offer more favorable sales terms or better products, OEMs and other manufacturers may reduce availability or decline to include our products in their vehicles. Adverse developments affecting one or more of our suppliers could harm our profitability and business reputation. Our supply chain may be adversely impacted by events outside of our control, including macro-economic events, trade restrictions, political crises, labor relations issues, liquidity constraints, natural or environmental occurrences or other factors noted herein that can adversely affect us, which may adversely affect our operations and profitability. In particular, many of our products include TEDs, which contain certain raw materials that generally cannot be substituted. The prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions. Tellurium, a raw material used in TEDs, and other key raw materials include copper, silver and petroleum-based engineered plastics. If the market prices for these raw materials significantly increases, as they have in the past, our gross profit may be adversely impacted to the extent our suppliers pass those price increases on to us. 13 If our suppliers fail to deliver products, parts and components of sufficient quality and to our other stated written expectations on a time ly basis , we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders, sales and profits could decline, and our commercial reputation could be damaged. If we were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of our suppliers, particularly those who are sole sources, and could not procure the components from other sources, we would be unable to meet its production schedules for some of our key products or to ship such products to our customers in a timely fashion which would adversely affect sales, margins and customer relations. Furthermore, unfavorable economic or industry conditions could result in financial distress within our supply base, thereby increasing the risk of supply disruption. Our business is subject to risks associated with manufacturing processes. If certain of our existing production facilities become incapable of manufacturing products for any reason, we may be unable to meet production requirements, sales and profits could decline, and our commercial reputation could be damaged. Without operation of certain existing production facilities, we may be limited in our ability to deliver products until we restore the manufacturing capability at the particular facility, find an alternative manufacturing facility or arrange an alternative source of supply. We maintain property damage insurance that we believe to be adequate to provide for reconstruction of facilities and equipment, as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from any production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss. However, any recovery under our insurance policies may not offset the lost sales, harm to our business reputation or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations. Further, any such proceeds may be received and accounted for in a different reporting period, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow generally or for a specific reporting period. Work stoppages, including those at our customers, and similar events could significantly disrupt our business Because the automotive industry relies heavily on “just-in-time” delivery of components, a work stoppage at one or more of Gentherm's production facilities could have adverse effects on the business. Similarly, if one or more of our direct customers or an OEM were to experience a work stoppage, such as what occurred during the General Motors labor strike occurring in fall 2019, our customer would likely halt or limit purchases of our products, which could result in the temporary shutdown of the related Gentherm production facilities or other restructuring initiatives. Our global operations subject us to risks that may harm our operations and financial results. In 2019, 55% of our product revenue was generated from sales to customers outside the United States. We have significant personnel, property, equipment and operations in a number of countries outside of the United States, including Canada, China, Germany, Hungary, Macedonia, Mexico, Ukraine and Vietnam. Our exposure to the risks described below is substantial. We also derive a significant portion of revenues from Europe and Asia and conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies. In addition to the general risks relating to our operations, our international operations are subject to unique risks inherent in doing business abroad, including: • exposure to local economic, political and labor conditions. • different and complex local laws and regulations and enforcement thereof, including those relating to governance, taxes, litigation, anti-corruption, employment, employee benefits, environmental, competition, permitting, investment, product regulations, repatriation, and export/import restrictions or requirements, such as the recently implemented revised emissions test procedure in Europe referred to as the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure that has limited the production of certain vehicles as OEMs have struggled to meet the new requirements ; • increases in duties, tariffs and taxation on our products related to U.S. trade disputes; trade restrictions and potential trade wars, including limitation on imports or exports of components or assembled products, unilaterally or bilaterally; • exposure to infectious disease and epidemics, including the effects on our business operations, and those of our customers and suppliers, in geographic locations impacted by an outbreak, such as the ongoing coronavirus outbreak that began in China; 14 • violence and civil unrest (including acts of terrorism, drug-cartel related and other forms of violence and outbreaks of war); • expropriation, nationalization or other protectionist activities; • currency exchange rate fluctuations and currency controls; in particular, a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, including the Euro, the Chinese Renminbi, the Vietnamese Dong, the Hungarian Forint, the Macedonian Denar, the Ukrainian Hryvnia, and the Mexican Peso; • local business and cultural factors that differ from our customary standards and practices, including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in due to anti-corruption laws and regulations; and • ineffective legal protection of our intellectual property rights in certain countries. In particular, we derived over 20% of our revenue in fiscal 2019 (based on shipment destination) from Japan, China and South Korea. We have three manufacturing facilities in China, and several of our customers, subcontractors and suppliers also are located in China as well as Japan and South Korea. As a result of the coronavirus, our operations, and those of our customers and suppliers, have experienced and in the future may experience delays or disruptions, such as difficulty obtaining components, travel restrictions and temporary suspension of operations. In addition, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected to the extent that coronavirus or any other epidemic or outbreak harms motor vehicle product consumption specifically and the economies of China, Japan and South Korea and the world generally Additionally, our primary manufacturing locations are in Mexico, China, Vietnam, Macedonia and Ukraine, all countries that have historically experienced a heightened degree of political, civil and labor uncertainty. Political conflict and related demonstrations and violence in Ukraine in recent years, for example, highlights the risks to our foreign manufacturing facilities. Although our manufacturing facility in Ukraine is located approximately 700 miles by road from Kiev, and approximately the same distance from the activities along the border of Ukraine and Russia where fighting has occurred, we cannot be certain that similar demonstrations, unrest and international tensions will not affect our facility in the future, including due to electrical outages and periodic battles with separatists closer to our facility. In addition, certain of our employees in Ukraine are routinely conscripted into the military and/or sent to the Russian border to fight in the ongoing conflict. Furthermore, most of our products manufactured in Ukraine are shipped across the border from Ukraine to Hungary for further delivery to our customers. If that border crossing were to be closed or restricted for any reason, we would essentially experience a loss of the use of our Ukrainian facility, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. Our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely impacted from a decrease in or cessation or clawback of government incentives related to investments. We receive economic benefits from national, state and local governments in various regions of the world in the form of incentives designed to encourage manufacturers to establish, maintain or increase investment, workforce or production. These incentives may take various forms, including grants, loan subsidies and tax abatements or credits. The impact of these incentives can be significant in a particular market during a reporting period. A decrease in, expiration without renewal of, or other cessation or clawback of government incentives for any of our business units, as a result of administrative decision or otherwise, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition, as well as our ability to fund new investments. Changes to trade policy, including tariffs and customs regulations, could have a material and adverse effect on our business. A significant portion of our business activities are conducted in foreign countries, including Mexico. As a result of changes to U.S. administrative policy, there may be changes to existing trade agreements, like NAFTA and its anticipated successor agreement, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (“USMCA”) which is still subject to approval by Canada, greater restrictions on free trade generally, and significant increases in tariffs on goods imported into the U.S., particularly tariffs on products manufactured in Mexico, among other possible changes. Additionally, during 2018, the U.S. and China applied significant tariffs to certain of each other’s exports. The institution of trade tariffs, both globally and between the U.S. and China specifically, carries the risk of negatively impacting overall economic conditions, which could have negative repercussions on the Company. More directly, imposition of tariffs has caused and could cause further increases in the costs of our raw materials which we may not be able to pass on to our customers in part or in full, which would directly and negatively impact our business. We purchase a significant amount of raw material components, including products 15 manufactured in our China facilities, which are subject to such tariffs. The imposition of tariffs has caused and could cause further increases in the costs of our raw materials, and we may not be able to mitigate the impact from these tariffs or additional future tariffs. Most recently, a “phase one” trade deal signed between the U.S. and China on January 15, 2020 accompanied a U.S. decision to cancel a plan to increase tariffs on an additional list of Chinese products. While the signing of the agreement signals a cooling of tensions between the U.S. and China over trade, concerns over the stability of bilateral trade relations remain, particularly given the limited scope of the phase one agreement. Depending upon their duration and implementation, as well as our ability to mitigate their impact, these tariffs, the executive order and its implementation and other regulatory actions could materially affect our business, including in the form of increase cost of goods sold, decreased margins, increased pricing for customers, and reduced sales. The United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union may have a negative impact on global economic conditions, financial markets and our financial results. The United Kingdom left the European Union January 31, 2020 (“Brexit”). Under the current withdrawal agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union, the United Kingdom will be subject to a transition period until December 31, 2020, during which European Union rules will continue to apply. The relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union after the transition period has not been determined yet. As a result, the impact of Brexit is not yet known and depends on any agreements the United Kingdom and European Union may make to retain access to each other's markets after the transition period. The measures or lack of any agreement may continue to impact global light vehicle production, and affect the business of and/or our relationships with our customers and suppliers, as well as alter the relationship among tariffs and currencies. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainly and potentially divergent national laws and regulations, including with respect to data privacy. A withdrawal from the European Union is unprecedented and it is unclear what financial, trade, legal and employment implications the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union will have following the transition period and how the withdrawal will affect us. Adverse consequences such as reduced consumer spending, deterioration in economic conditions, volatility in exchange rates, and prohibitive laws and regulations could have a negative impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Tax matters, including changes in the corporate tax rates, disagreement with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could impact our results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and our operations, plans and results are affected by tax legislation and other initiatives. For example, on December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (H.R. 1) (the “Tax Act”) was signed into law by President Trump. The Tax Act contained significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of earnings (except for certain small business), limitation of the deduction for net operation losses (“NOLs”) to 80% of current year taxable income and elimination of NOL carrybacks, one time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they were repatriated, elimination of U.S. tax on foreign earnings (subject to certain important exceptions), new taxes on certain foreign earnings, a new minimum tax related to payment to foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and the modification or repeal of many business deductions and credits. It remains uncertain if, and to what extent, various states will conform to the Tax Act and if foreign countries will react by adopting tax legislation or taking other actions. We are also subject to regular reviews, examinations, and audits by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities with respect to our taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken, we could face additional tax liability, including interest and penalties. There can be no assurance that payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes will not have a material impact on our result of operations and financial position. We also need to comply with new, evolving or revised tax laws and regulations. The enactment of or increases in tariffs, or other changes in the application or interpretation of the Tax Act, or on specific products that we sell or with which our products compete, may have an adverse effect on our business or on our results of operations. Our patient temperature management business is subject to extensive industry regulation and failure to comply with all applicable rules and regulation may adversely impact us. Our patient temperature management products are subject to extensive, complex, costly and evolving government regulation. In the United States, this is principally administered by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). Various regulatory agencies in foreign countries where our medical products are sold also regulate that business. Under both United States and foreign country 16 regulations, we are subject to periodic inspection of our facilities (including third-party facilities that are performing services for us) , procedures and operations and testing of our products. Following such FDA inspections, should any noncompliance with regulations or other quality issues be noted, we may receive observations, notices, citations and/or warning letters that could require us to get FDA approval of a corrective action plan and modify certain activities identified during the inspection, possibly at a significant cost. We are also required to report adverse events associated with our medical products to the FDA and other foreign regulatory authorities where our products have been approved or received market clearance . Unexpected or serious health or safety concerns could result in liability claims, recalls, market withdrawals or other regulatory actions. Changes in laws or regulations could require us to change the way we operate or to utilize resources to maintain compliance, which could increase costs or otherwise disrupt operations. In addition, failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations could result in fines or revocation of our operating permits and licenses or, in rare circumstances, market withdrawal of the product . The process for obtaining governmental approval to manufacture and market new medical devices is time-consuming and costly. We are dependent on receiving FDA and other governmental or third-party approvals prior to manufacturing, marketing and shipping any new medical products. We cannot be certain that any new medical products we develop will receive FDA or other necessary approvals. Also receipt of approval in one country does not guarantee approval by the FDA or any other foreign regulatory agency. Defects or quality issues associated with our medical products could adversely affect the results of our operations. The design, manufacture and marketing of medical products involve certain inherent risks. Manufacturing or design defects, component failures, unapproved or improper use of our products, or inadequate disclosure of risks or other information relating to the use of our products can lead to regulatory action, injury or other serious adverse events. These events could lead to recalls or safety alerts relating to our products (either voluntary or as required by the FDA or similar governmental authorities in other countries), and could result, in certain cases, in the removal of a product from the market. A recall, inadequate disclosure or defect could result in significant costs and lost sales and customers, enforcement actions and/or investigations by state and federal governments or other enforcement bodies, as well as negative publicity and damage to our reputation that could reduce future demand for our products. Personal injuries relating to the use of our products can also result in significant product liability claims being brought against us. In some circumstances, such adverse events could also cause delays in regulatory approval of new products or the imposition of post-market approval requirements, such as further clinical testing. Such clinical testing is costly and time-consuming and could delay market approval or the meeting of additional post-market requirements. Any failure to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations could have a material and adverse effect on our reputation, business and financial results. Our operations outside of the United States require us to comply with various anti-bribery and anti-corruption regulations, including but not limited to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act and the China Anti-Unfair Competition Law. Violations of these laws, which are complex and often difficult to interpret and apply, could result in significant criminal penalties or sanctions that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We are subject to significant foreign currency risk and foreign exchange exposure related to our global operations. A significant portion of our global transactions is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. While we sometimes employ financial instruments to hedge some of our transactional foreign exchange exposure, developing an effective and economical foreign currency risk strategy is complex and expensive and no strategy can completely insulate us from those exposures. Exchange rates can be volatile and could adversely affect our financial results and comparability of results from period to period. We use important intellectual property in our business. If we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if a third party makes assertions against us or our customers relating to intellectual property rights, our business could be adversely affected . We own important intellectual property, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, and are involved in numerous licensing arrangements. Our intellectual property plays an important role in maintaining our competitive position in many of the markets that we serve. 17 We cannot guarantee, however, that we will be able to secure all desired protection, nor that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate , to prevent infringement of our rights or misappropriation or theft of our technology, trade secrets or know-how. For example, effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some of the countries in which we operate. In addition, while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our trade secrets, know-how, business strategy and other proprietary information, such confidentiality agreements could be breached or otherwise may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and know-how related to the design, manufacture or operation of our products. If it became necessary for us to resort to litigation to protect our intellectual property rights, any proceedings could be burdensome and costly, and we may not prevail. Further, adequate remedies may not be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets and manufacturing expertise. Finally, for those products in our portfolio that rely on patent protection, once a patent has expired, the product is generally open to competition. Products under patent protection usually generate significantly higher revenues than those not protected by patents. If we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could suffer, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, our competitors may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our proprietary technologies or design around the patents we own or license. Further, as we expand our operations in jurisdictions where the protection of intellectual property rights is less robust, such as China, the risk of others duplicating our proprietary technologies increases, despite efforts we undertake to protect them. Foreign governments may adopt regulations, and foreign governments or courts may render decisions, requiring compulsory licensing of intellectual property rights, or foreign governments may require products to meet standards that serve to favor local companies or provide reduced protection relative to other countries. A significant product liability lawsuit, warranty claim or product recall involving us or one of our major customers, or an investigation regarding vehicle safety generally, could materially and adversely affect our financial performance. In the event that our products fail to perform as expected, whether allegedly due to our fault or that of one of our suppliers, and such failure results in, or is alleged to result in, bodily injury and/or property damage or other losses, we may be subject to product liability lawsuits and other claims, and we have been in the past and may again be required or requested by our customers or regulators to participate in a recall or other corrective action involving such products. We also are a party to agreements with certain of our customers, whereby these customers may pursue claims against us for contribution of all or a portion of the amounts sought in connection with product liability and warranty claims. We carry insurance for certain product liability claims, and have utilized such insurance periodically. However, such coverage may be limited for future claims. In addition, we may not be successful in recovering amounts from third parties, including suppliers, in connection with these claims. These types of claims could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. We are involved from time to time in various legal and regulatory proceedings and claims, which could adversely affect our financial performance. We are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings and claims that, from time to time, are significant. These are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business including, without limitation, commercial or contractual disputes, including disputes with our customers, suppliers or competitors, intellectual property matters, personal injury claims, environmental matters, tax matters and employment matters. Such legal and regulatory proceedings could result in an adverse outcome for the Company that would adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our success depends in part on retaining key personnel and effective succession planning. Our success will depend to a large extent upon the continued contributions of key personnel. The loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers could adversely affect our business. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. Further, our success will depend, in part, upon our ability to recruit and retain qualified engineering and other technical and marketing personnel. There is significant competition for technologically qualified personnel in our business and we may not be successful in recruiting or retaining sufficient qualified personnel. 18 We are required to comply with environmental laws and regulations that could cause us to incur significant costs. Our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect the environment, and we expect that additional requirements with respect to environmental matters will be imposed on us in the future. We may also assume, or be deemed to assume, significant environmental liabilities in acquisitions. Environmental liability may be imposed without regard to fault, and under certain circumstances, can be joint and several, resulting in one party being held responsible for the entire obligation. Material future expenditures may be necessary if compliance standards change or material unknown conditions that require remediation are discovered. No assurance can be given that all environmental liabilities have been identified or that no prior owner or operator of our properties or former properties has created an environmental condition not known to us. Environmental laws could also restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses in connection with our business. Violations of these requirements could result in fines or sanctions, obligations to investigate or remediate contamination, third party property damage or personal injury claims due to the migration of contaminants off-site, or modification or revocation of our operating permits, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, proposed and existing efforts to address climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions could directly or indirectly affect our costs of energy, materials, manufacturing, distribution, packaging and other operating costs, which could impact our business and financial results. We may be unable to realize the expected benefits of our restructuring actions, which could adversely affect our profitability and operations. We have undertaken significant restructuring activities in recent years that remain ongoing, and may take future restructuring actions to realign and resize our production capacity and cost structure, lower our cost base, improve our financial performance and cash flow generation, and create a simplified organization best positioned to deliver on our key financial and operational priorities. Charges related to these actions or any further restructuring actions may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. We cannot ensure that any current or future restructuring will be completed as planned, on a timely basis or at all, will be on budget, or achieve the desired results. Our existing indebtedness and the inability to access capital markets could restrict our business activities or our ability to execute our strategic objectives or adversely affect our financial performance. As of December 31, 2019, our total consolidated indebtedness was $80.6 million. We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future. This significant amount of debt could have important, adverse consequences to us and our investors, including: • requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest payments; • making it more difficult to satisfy other obligations; • increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; • reducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow our businesses • limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and industries; and • limiting our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise; Our debt agreements contain certain restrictive covenants and customary events of default. These restrictive covenants limit our ability to take certain actions, such as, among other things: incur additional debt, make certain payments or distributions (including for the repurchase or redemption of our shares), engage in mergers or consolidations, make certain dispositions and transfers of assets, enter into transactions with affiliates and guarantee indebtedness. While not unusual for financings of the type that we have, the restrictions in our credit facilities may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and may make it difficult for us to execute our business plans, take advantage of business opportunities, or react to changing industry conditions. To the extent that we incur additional indebtedness, the risks described above could increase. In addition, our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. Our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to service our outstanding debt or to repay the outstanding debt as it becomes due, and we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms, or at all, to service or refinance our debt. 19 If an event of default would occur under our existing debt agreements or any additional indebtedness, our lenders could declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable, which may cause cross-defaults under our other debt obligations. If our lenders accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness, we may not have sufficient capital available at that time to pay the amounts due to all lenders on a timely basis, and there is no guarantee that we would be able to repay, refinance, or restructure the payments on such debt. Further, under our existing credit facilities, the lenders would have the right to foreclose on certain of our assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition . An adverse change in the interest rates for our borrowings could adversely affect our financial condition Our current outstanding variable rate indebtedness uses LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms may cause LIBOR to disappear entirely after 2021 or to perform differently than in the past. We expect that reasonable alternatives to LIBOR will be created and implemented prior to the 2021 target date. Fallback provisions are being written into LIBOR-based contracts to attempt to reduce the risk of sudden and unpredictable increases in the cost of variable rate indebtedness. However, we cannot predict the consequences and timing of these developments. Additionally, in the future, we may need to renegotiate our existing indebtedness or incur other indebtedness, and the phase-out of LIBOR may negatively impact the terms of such indebtedness. In addition, the overall financial market may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and liquidity. Security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology networks and systems, including a disruption related to cybersecurity, could interfere with our operations and could compromise the confidentiality of our proprietary information or personal information. We rely upon information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed or hosted by third-parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including electronic communications among our locations around the world and between Company personnel and our customers and suppliers, supply chain management, manufacturing, and invoicing and collection of payments. We use these information technology network and systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting and legal and tax requirements. Additionally, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, the proprietary business information of our customers and suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of our employees, customers and suppliers, in data centers, on information technology networks and systems, some of which are operated by third parties and third-party locations. The secure operation of these data centers, information technology networks, and systems and the processing, maintenance, confidentiality, integrity and availability of this information, is critical to our business operations and strategy. The Company maintains an information risk management program which is supervised by information technology management and reviewed by a cross-functional committee. As part of this program, reports that include analysis of emerging risks as well as the Company’s plans and strategies to address them are regularly prepared and presented to senior management and the Board of Directors. Despite security measures, such as disaster recovery and business continuity plans, including those measures related to cybersecurity, these data centers, our information technology networks and systems may be vulnerable to damage, corruption, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers or breaches due to errors or malfeasance by employees, contractors and others who have access to our networks and systems, or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, geopolitical events, or natural disasters or other catastrophic events. Cyber threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. The occurrence of any of the aforementioned events, many of which are outside our control, could compromise our systems or networks and the information stored there, which may include confidential or proprietary information or personal information of third parties, could be accessed, publicly disclosed, compromised, corrupted, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss or corruption of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disrupt operations, cause a loss of confidence in our reputation, goodwill, products and services, reduce the competitive advantage we expect to derive from our investment in advanced technologies and adversely affect our financial condition, 20 results of operati ons , and cash flows. We maintain cyber risk insurance, but this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses from any future breaches of our systems. We may face particular privacy, data security and data protection risks. Legislators and/or regulators in countries in which we operate are increasingly adopting or revising privacy, information security and data protection laws. In particular, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective on May 25, 2018, imposes additional obligations and risk upon our business and which increases substantially the penalties to which we could be subject in the event of any non-compliance. The GDPR and other similar laws and regulations, including the new California Consumer Protection Act (“CCPA”) and other similar state laws recently or soon to be enacted, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions, may be costly to comply with, result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, and subject us to remedies that may harm our business, including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices. Furthermore, the CCPA went into effect on January 1, 2020 and many of its requirements have not yet been interpreted by courts, and best practices are still being developed by the industry, all of which increase the risk of compliance failure and related adverse impacts. Any failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures may affect our ability to accurately report our financial results, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, fail to prevent fraud and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we must maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, which requires significant resources and management oversight. Effectiveness of such controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, effectively prevent fraud and to operate successfully as a public company. Our management determined we had a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, which we determined was remediated as of September 30, 2019. Any future failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures, or timely effect any necessary improvement of such controls, could harm our results of operations or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, which could subject us to adverse regulatory consequences. Ineffectiveness of such controls also could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our stock. We are currently restricted in our ability to make dividend payments on our Common Stock. Furthermore, we do not anticipate paying dividends on our Common Stock in the near future. Our bank credit facilities generally restrict our ability to pay cash of dividends on our Common Stock so long as such facilities are outstanding. We have never paid any cash dividends on our Common Stock and do not anticipate paying dividends in the near future. The price of our Common Stock may fluctuate significantly. The price of our Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market has experienced substantial price volatility in the past and may continue to do so in the future. Additionally, the Company, the automotive industry and the stock market as a whole have experienced significant stock price and volume fluctuations that have affected stock prices in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies’ operating performance. Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which the Company repurchases its stock to exceed the stock’s price at a given point in time. If the Company fails to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, share repurchases or other market expectations, its stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse impact on investor confidence and employee retention.

MARKET FOR THE REGISTRANT’S COMMON STOCK, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Market Information Our Common Stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “THRM.” Holders As of February 14, 2020, our Common Stock was held by 40 shareholders of record. A substantially greater number of holders are beneficial owners whose shares of record are held by banks, brokers and other nominees. Dividends We have not paid any Common Stock cash dividends since formation and we do not expect to pay any in the foreseeable future. The payment of future dividends is within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon business conditions, our earnings and financial condition and other factors. Currently, our bank credit facilities limit payment of dividends on our Common Stock. Stock Repurchase Program In December 2016, the Board of Directors authorized a three-year, $100 million stock repurchase program. In June 2018, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the stock repurchase plan to $300 million and extended the stock repurchase plan until December 2020. Under the program, we may repurchase, from time to time, our common stock in amounts and at prices as we deem appropriate, taking into account market conditions, applicable legal requirements, debt covenants and other considerations. The number of shares repurchased and the time of the repurchases under the stock repurchase program will be determined by our management. Repurchases may be made on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, our consolidated financial statements (and notes related thereto) and other more detailed financial information appearing elsewhere in this Report. Further, you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this Report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. See also “Forward-Looking Statements” in Item 1 of this Report. Overview Gentherm Incorporated is a global developer and marketer of innovative thermal management technologies for a broad range of heating and cooling and temperature control applications. Our products provide solutions for automotive passenger climate comfort and convenience, battery thermal management and cell connecting systems, as well as patient temperature management within the health care industry. Our automotive products can be found on the vehicles of nearly all major automotive manufacturers operating in North America, Europe and Asia. We operate in locations aligned with our major customers’ product strategies to provide locally enhanced design, integration and production capabilities. The Company is also developing a number of new technologies and products that will help enable improvements to existing products and to create new product applications for existing and new markets. We believe that innovation is an important element to gaining market acceptance of our products and strengthening our market position. During 2019, we secured an estimated $1.5 billion of automotive new business awards, which represents the estimated future lifetime product revenues for all automotive customers. This amount does not represent firm customer orders. We report our new business awards primarily based on communication of award from our customers using price and volume projections available at the time of award, and we have not updated such previously communicated estimates as of December 31, 2019 or the date hereof. Our estimates of automotive new business awards are forward-looking statements and may not actually be achieved. See the risk factor “We may not realize sales represented by awarded business” in Item 1A “Risk Factors” of Part I of this report. Recent Trends and Economic Conditions Our sales are driven by the number of vehicles produced by the automotive manufacturers, which is ultimately dependent on consumer demand for automotive vehicles, and our content per vehicle. New vehicle demand is driven by macro-economic and other factors, such as interest rates, manufacturer and dealer sales incentives, fuel prices, consumer confidence, employment levels, income growth trends and government and tax incentives. According to the forecasting firm IHS Markit, global light vehicle production was 88.9 million units in 2019, down from 94.2 million units in 2018, a decline of 5.6%. Actual light vehicle production volumes in North America for 2019 were 16.3 million units compared to 17.0 million units in 2018, a decrease of 4.0%, and light vehicle production volumes in Europe were 21.1 million units for 2019 compared to 22.0 million units in 2018, a decrease of 4.2%. Actual light vehicle production volumes in Japan/Korea remained relatively stable with 13.1 million units in 2019 compared to 13.2 million units in 2018, a decrease of 0.8%. The largest light vehicle production volume decline was in China, with 24.7 million units in 2019 compared to 26.9 million units in 2018, a decrease of 8.2%. IHS Markit forecasted light vehicle production volumes for 2020 is 87.2 million units, a decline of 1.9% from 2019 primarily related to the recent coronavirus outbreak originating from China, and the significant impact to manufacturing and consumption in the broader China market, as well as Japan and South Korea. The coronavirus outbreak has resulted in extended shutdown of certain businesses in the region and disruptions in the supply chain, which could result in further social, economic and labor instability. Economic volatility or weakness in North America, Europe or Asia, could result in a significant reduction in automotive sales and production by our customers, which would have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. There is also potential that geopolitical factors could adversely impact the U.S. and other economies, and specifically the automotive sector. While our diversified automotive OEM customer base and geographic revenue base, along with our flexible cost structure, have well positioned us to withstand the impact of industry downturns and benefit from industry upturns, shifts in the mix of global automotive production to higher cost regions or to vehicles with less content could adversely impact our profitability. 26 Volatility, weakness or slow growth in markets for hybrid electric vehicles could result in less growth in automotive sales and production by our customers than planned, which would have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Fit-for-Growth On June 25, 2018, Gentherm announced a strategic plan intended to improve business performance and position the Company to deliver above market growth and improved profitability to its shareholders. An important element of the strategy was the Fit-for-Growth initiative that focused on purchasing excellence, rationalization of research and development activities, reducing selling, general and administrative expense, minimization or elimination of investments in non-core areas and developing a manufacturing footprint commensurate with the new plan. During 2018, the Company initiated this strategy through the sale of its battery management systems division located in Irvine, California and the site consolidation of its advanced research and development operations which resulted in vacating two leased facilities in Azusa, California. Further, the Company exited, several product categories including furniture, aviation, battery management electronics, industrial battery packs, automotive thermoelectric generators and other non-core electronics. Additionally, the Company undertook restructuring actions to reduce global overhead costs to improve selling, general and administrative expense. During 2019, the Company completed its plan to eliminate non-core areas of investment through the divestitures of its environmental test equipment business, Cincinnati Sub-Zero industrial chamber business (“CSZ-IC”) and its remote power generation systems business, Gentherm Global Power Technologies (“GPT”). In addition, we launched a plan to optimize our manufacturing footprint and took additional actions to reduce costs through purchasing excellence and additional restructuring activities focused on reductions of selling, general and administrative expense. The Company continues to execute the Fit-for-Growth strategy in an effort deliver market growth and improve profitability to its shareholders. Divestitures Divestiture of CSZ-IC On February 1, 2019, the Company completed the divestiture of CSZ-IC and the former Cincinnati Sub-Zero headquarters facility to Weiss Technik North America, Inc. for total cash proceeds of $47.5 million, including $2.5 million of cash proceeds placed into an escrow account for a period of up to one year as partial security for the Company’s obligations under the sale agreement. In connection with the sale, Gentherm entered into an operating lease agreement for a portion of the office and manufacturing building space purchased by Weiss Technik North America, Inc. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized a $4.3 million gain on sale, which is classified as Asset impairments and net loss on divestitures within the consolidated statements of income. Divestiture of GPT On October 1, 2019, the Company completed the divesture of GPT for a nominal amount. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized asset impairments and loss on sale totaling $27.1 million, consisting of $16.8 million of impairment on assets held for sale, $4.5 million related to impairment of an equity investment that met held for sale criteria during 2019 and $5.8 million of loss on sale, which includes $4.0 million related to the release of previously deferred foreign currency translation losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and $1.5 million related to a loan to the buyer that was considered uncollectible. These impairment charges and loss on sale are classified as Asset impairments and net loss on divestitures within the consolidated statements of income. Acquisitions Acquisition of Stihler Electronic GmbH (“Stihler”) On April 1, 2019, Gentherm acquired Stihler, a leading developer and manufacturer of patient and blood temperature management systems, for a purchase price of $15.5 million, net of cash acquired and including $0.7 million of contingent consideration to be paid upon achievement of a milestone that must be completed by September 2020. In addition, the purchase agreement includes a contingent payment of $0.7 million to be paid if the selling shareholder remains employed by Stihler through 27 December 2020 , which will be recorded as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses ratably over the service period. The results of operations of Stihler are reported within the Company’s Industrial segment from the date of acquisition. Acquisition of Etratech On November 1, 2017, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed substantially all of the operating liabilities of Etratech Inc., an Ontario corporation and all of the outstanding shares of Etratech Hong Kong, an entity organized under the laws of Hong Kong, in an all-cash transaction for a purchase price of $65.0 million, net of cash acquired of $0.7 million. Etratech manufactures advanced electronic controls and control systems for the automotive, RV and marine, security, medical and other industries. The results of operations of Etratech are reported within the Company’s Automotive segment from the date of acquisition. Manufacturing Footprint Rationalization On September 23, 2019, the Company committed to a restructuring plan to improve the Company’s manufacturing productivity and rationalize its footprint. Under this plan, the Company will relocate and consolidate certain existing automotive manufacturing and, as a result, certain other activities, overall reducing the number of plants by two. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized expense of $4.9 million for employee separation costs that will be paid pursuant to the terms of statutory requirements of the affected locations. Additionally, the Company recognized $2.1 million of accelerated depreciation and fixed asset impairment. The Company expects to incur total costs of between $20.0 million and $24.0 million, of which between $17.0 million and $21.0 million are expected to be cash expenditures. The total expected costs include employee separation costs of between $9.0 million and $11.0 million, capital expenditures of between $4.5 million and $5.5 million and non-cash expenses for accelerated depreciation and impairment of fixed assets of $3.0 million. The Company also expects to incur other transition costs including recruiting, relocation, and machinery and equipment move and set up costs of between $3.5 million and $4.5 million. The actions under this plan are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2021. The actual timing, costs and savings of the Plan may differ materially from the Company’s current expectations and estimates. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for information about our restructuring activities. Stock Repurchase Program In December 2016, the Board of Directors authorized a three-year, $100.0 million stock repurchase program. In June 2018, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the stock repurchase plan to $300.0 million and extended the stock repurchase plan until December 2020. In 2019, we repurchased approximately $63.3 million of shares and have a remaining repurchase authorization of approximately $83.3 million. For further information related to our stock repurchase program, see Item 5, ""Market for the Company’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities,"" and Note 16, ""Equity"" to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report. Reportable Segments The Company has two reportable segments for financial reporting purposes: Automotive and Industrial. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our reportable segments as well as their proportional contribution to the Company’s reported product revenues and operating income. The financial information used by our chief operating decision maker to assess operating performance and allocate resources is based on these reportable segments.

The decrease in product revenues is due to unfavorable volumes in our Automotive segment, including adverse impacts of $12.4 million resulting from the General Motors labor strike. Product revenues were also negatively impacted by unfavorable foreign currency impacts, primarily related to the Euro, Korean Won and Chinese Renminbi. The decrease in product revenues included in Variance Due To Pricing/Other above is primarily attributable to the divestitures of CSZ-IC on February 1, 2019 and GPT on October 1, 2019, the acquisition of Stihler on April 1, 2019, as well as decreases in customer pricing. 29 Cost of Sales Below is a summary of our cost of sales and gross margin, in thousands, for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018: Year Ended December 31, Variance Due To: 2019 2018 Favorable / (Unfavorable) Volume Operational Performance FX Other Total Cost of sales $ 683,349 $ 743,647 $ 60,298 $ 1,918 $ 28,073 $ 10,755 $ 19,552 $ 60,298 Gross margin 288,335 304,858 (16,523 ) (1,253 ) 13,755 (8,740 ) (20,285 ) (16,523 ) Gross margin - Percentage of product revenues 29.7 % 29.1 % Cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 decreased 8.1% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2018. The decrease in cost of sales is due to volumes decreases in our Automotive segment, operational performance improvements, and favorable foreign currency impacts, primarily attributable to the Euro, Chinese Renminbi and Mexican Peso. The operational performance improvements are primarily attributable to decreases in headcount, overtime, expedited freight and material costs. The decrease in cost of sales is also due to the following items included in Variance Due To Other above: ▪ $33.8 million of decrease attributable to divested businesses (CSZ-IC and GPT); ▪ $6.7 million of increase due to higher labor costs in Mexico, Macedonia and China; and ▪ $5.1 million of increase attributable to Medical, including impact of the acquisition of Stihler on April 1, 2019.

Income Tax Expense Below is a summary of our income tax expense, in thousands, for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 Favorable / (Unfavorable) Income tax expense $ 21,645 $ 16,220 $ (5,425 ) Income tax expense was $21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019, on earnings before income tax of $59.2 million, representing an effective tax rate of 36.6%. The pre-tax earnings amount included the non-deductible impairment loss of $27.1 million. Adjusted for the impairment loss, the effective tax rate was 25.1% for 2019. The effective tax rate differed from the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the international provisions of the U.S. tax reform, such as global intangible low-tax income (“GILTI”), enacted in December 2017, partly offset by certain intercompany transactions which disproportionately benefited lower tax rate jurisdictions. Income tax expense was $16.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2018, on earnings before income tax of $58.1 million, representing an effective tax rate of 27.9%. The pre-tax earnings amount included the non-deductible impairment loss of $11.5 million . Adjusted for the impairment loss, the effective tax rate was 23.3% for 2018. The effective tax rate differed from the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the international provisions of the U.S. tax reform, such as global intangible low-tax income (“GILTI”), enacted in December 2017, partly offset by certain intercompany transactions which disproportionately benefited lower tax rate jurisdictions. 32 Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash and Cash Flows The Company has funded its financial needs primarily through cash flows from operating activities and equity and debt financings. Our ongoing strategic plan sets forth a capital allocation strategy that includes a targeted debt-to-earnings leverage ratio and allows for some of our cash flow to be paid back to investors through Common Stock repurchases. On June 25, 2018, our Board of Directors increased the Company’s stock repurchase authorization to $300.0 million, of which $83.3 million of availability remained as of December 31, 2019. This authorization expires on December 16, 2020. Based on its current operating plan, management believes cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2019, together with cash flows from operating activities, and borrowing available under our Amended Credit Agreement, are sufficient to meet operating and capital expenditure needs, and to service debt, for at least the next 12 months. However, if cash flows from operations decline, we may need to obtain alternative sources of capital and reduce or delay capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments, all of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, it is likely that we will need to complete one or more equity or debt financings if we consummate any significant acquisition or several smaller acquisitions. There can be no assurance that such capital will be available at all or on reasonable terms, which could adversely affect our future operations and business strategy. The following table represents our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, in thousands: December 31, 2019 2018 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period $ 39,620 $ 103,172 Cash provided by operating activities 118,803 118,434 Cash provided by (used in) investing activities 5,840 (40,757 ) Cash used in financing activities (108,593 ) (139,266 ) Foreign currency effect on cash and cash equivalents (2,722 ) (1,963 ) Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 52,948 $ 39,620 Cash Flows From Operating Activities We manage our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to fund operating requirements and preserve liquidity to take advantage of future business opportunities.

Additionally, working capital, net provided favorable cash flows related to accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other assets and accrued liabilities, and unfavorable amounts related to inventory and accounts payable. Working Capital The following table illustrates changes in working capital during 2019, in thousands: Working capital at December 31, 2018 $ 267,679 Increase in cash and cash equivalents 10,525 Decrease in accounts receivable (6,662 ) Increase in inventory 4,721 Decrease in tax receivables, net (8,609 ) Increase in other current assets 135 Decrease in payables 9,725 Increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities (6,589 ) Additional impairment on held for sale assets (14,701 ) Decrease in working capital from sale of business (42,603 ) Increase in working capital from acquisition of new company 5,203 Foreign currency effect on working capital (1,665 ) Working capital at December 31, 2019 $ 217,159 The following table highlights significant transactions that contributed to the increase in cash experienced during the year ended December 31, 2019, in thousands: Net cash provided by operating activities $ 118,803 Purchases of property and equipment (23,729 ) Repayment of debt (96,999 ) Borrowings from U.S. Revolving Note 37,812 Stock repurchases (63,283 ) Proceeds from the exercise of Common Stock options 16,557 Proceeds from divestitures of businesses, net 44,173 Acquisition of business, net of cash acquired (14,823 ) Other items (5,183 ) Increase in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash $ 13,328 The changes in current assets and liabilities reflects the classification of GPT and CSZ-IC (disposal group) as held for sale during 2018. All assets and liabilities of the disposal group were classified as held for sale within current assets and current liabilities, respectively, on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet for the year ended December 31, 2018. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statement for additional information about the assets and liabilities classified as held for sale. Cash Flows From Investing Activities Cash provided by investing activities was $5.8 million during 2019, reflecting cash proceeds of $47.5 million related to the sale of CSZ-IC, partially offset by the acquisition of Stihler for $14.8 million and purchases of property and equipment related to the expansion of production capacity totaling $23.7 million. 34 Cash Flows From Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities was $108.6 million during 2019, reflecting payments of principal on the U.S. Revolving Note, the DEG China Loan and the DEG Vietnam Loan totaling $97.0 million in aggregate, partially offset by additional borrowings on the U.S. Revolving Note totaling $37.8 million. Undrawn borrowing capacity under the U.S. Revolving Note was $403.4 million as of December 31, 2019. Cash was also paid during 2019 to repurchase Common Stock totaling $63.3 million, and for cancellations of restricted stock awards totaling $1.4 million. 35 Debt Amended Credit Agreement As of December 31, 2018, the Company, together with certain direct and indirect subsidiaries, had a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) which included a revolving credit note (“U.S. Revolving Note”) with a maximum borrowing capacity of $350.0 million. On June 27, 2019, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Amended Credit Agreement”) with a consortium of lenders and Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent. The Amended Credit Agreement amended and restated in its entirety the Credit Agreement. The outstanding principal and interest of the U.S. Revolving Note under the Credit Agreement continued and constitute obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement. The Amended Credit Agreement increased the U.S. Revolving Note from $350.0 million to $475.0 million and extended the maturity from March 17, 2021 to June 27, 2024. Subject to specified conditions, the Company can increase the U.S. Revolving Note or incur secured term loans in an aggregate amount of $175.0 million. The Amended Credit Agreement also provides $15.0 million availability for the issuance of letters of credit and a maximum of $40.0 million for swing line borrowing. Any amount of the facility utilized for letters of credit or swing line loans outstanding will reduce the amount available under the Amended Credit Agreement. The Company had $0 and $0.5 million of outstanding letters of credit issued under the Amended Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The U.S. borrowers and guarantors participating in the Amended Credit Agreement have entered into a related amended and restated pledge and security agreement. The amended and restated pledge and security agreement grants a security interest to the lenders in substantially all of the personal property of the Company and its U.S. subsidiaries designated as borrowers to secure their respective obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement, including the stock and membership interests of specified subsidiaries (limited to 66% of the stock in the case of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries). In addition to the security obligations, all obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by certain of the Company’s subsidiaries. The Amended Credit Agreement restricts, among other things, the amount of dividend payments the Company can make to shareholders. The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that will prohibit or limit the ability of the Borrowers and any material subsidiary to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, create liens, pay dividends, make certain types of investments (including acquisitions), enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates, prepay other indebtedness, sell assets, merge with other companies or enter into certain other transactions outside the ordinary course of business requires the Company and its subsidiaries to comply with customary affirmative and negative covenants, and contain customary events of default. These restrictions on the Company’s material subsidiaries have not had and are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s ability to meet its cash obligations. The Amended Credit Agreement also requires the Company to maintain a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio and Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined in the agreement. Under the Amended Credit Agreement, U.S. Dollar denominated loans bear interest at either a base rate (“Base Rate Loans”) or Eurocurrency rate (“Eurocurrency Rate Loans”), plus a margin (“Applicable Rate”). The rate for Base Rate Loans is equal to the highest of the Federal Funds Rate (1.55% at December 31, 2019) plus 0.50%, Bank of America’s prime rate (4.75% at December 31, 2019), or the Eurocurrency rate plus 1.00%. The rate for Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in U.S. Dollars is equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate (1.76% at December 31, 2019). All loans denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar must be Eurocurrency Rate Loans. Interest is payable at least quarterly. The Applicable Rate varies based on the Consolidated Leverage Ratio reported by the Company. As long as the Company is not in default of the terms and conditions of the Amended Credit Agreement, the lowest and highest possible Applicable Rate is 1.25% and 2.25%, respectively, for Eurocurrency Rate Loans and 0.25% and 1.25%, respectively, for Base Rate Loans. DEG Vietnam Loan The Company also has a fixed interest rate loan with the German Investment Corporation (“DEG”), a subsidiary of KfW Banking Group, a Germany government-owned development bank. The fixed interest rate senior loan agreement with DEG was used to finance the construction and set up of the Vietnam production facility (“DEG Vietnam Loan”). The DEG Vietnam Loan is subject to semi-annual principal payments that began November 2017 and will end May 2023. Under the terms of the DEG Vietnam Loan, the Company must maintain a minimum Equity Ratio and Enhanced Equity Ratio, as defined by the DEG Vietnam Loan agreement, based on the financial statements of Gentherm’s wholly owned subsidiary, Gentherm Vietnam Co. Ltd. 36 DEG China Loan The Company had a second DEG loan, which was used to fund capital investments in China (the “DEG China Loan”). The DEG China Loan was subject to semi-annual principal payments that began March 2015 and ended in September 2019. During the third quarter of 2019, the DEG China Loan was paid in full. The following table summarizes the Company’s debt at December 31, 2019 (dollars in thousands). December 31, 2019 Interest Rate Principal Balance Amended Credit Agreement: U.S. Revolving Note (U.S. Dollar Denominations) 3.05 % $ 50,000 U.S. Revolving Note (Euro Denominations) 1.25 % 21,874 DEG Vietnam Loan 5.21 % 8,750 DEG China Loan — — Total debt 80,624 Current maturities (2,500 ) Long-term debt, less current maturities $ 78,124 As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance with all terms as outlined in the Amended Credit Agreement and DEG Vietnam Loan. Undrawn borrowing capacity under the U.S. Revolving Note was $403.4 million as of December 31, 2019. Critical Accounting Policies The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. These estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to: • Product revenues; • Impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets; • Accrued warranty costs; • Litigation reserves; • Allowances for doubtful accounts; • Inventory reserves; • Income taxes; • Stock compensation; and • Pension plans Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized from agreements containing enforceable rights and obligations, when promised goods are delivered or services are completed. Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from revenue. Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are included in net sales, while costs of shipping and handling are included in cost of sale. Automotive Revenues The Company provides production parts to its customers under long-term supply agreements (“LTAs”). The duration of an LTA is generally consistent with the life cycle of a vehicle, however, an LTA does not reach the level of a performance obligation until Gentherm receives either a purchase order and/or a materials release from the customer for a specific number of parts at a specified price, at which point an enforceable contract exists. Revenue is recognized when control of the parts has transferred to the customer 37 according to the terms of the contract, which typically occurs when the parts are shipped or delivered to the customer’s premises . Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring parts. Certain LTAs provide for annual price reductions over the production life of the vehicle. Agreements that are determined to provide customers with purchase option discounts that would not be received without entering into the contract are considered to contain a material right (for example, a discount given to a customer that is incremental to the range of discounts typically given to that class of customer). The material right represents a purchase option that provides the customer with the ability to purchase additional production parts at a set price in the future and is accounted for as a separate performance obligation. Under these circumstances, each transfer of production parts under the LTA requires allocation of the purchase price to the production part and the purchase option. As a practical alternative to estimating the standalone selling price of an option, the Company allocates transaction price to the purchase option by reference to the production part volumes expected to be ordered and the consideration expected to be received over the life of the vehicle program. The production part’s relative standalone selling price observed under the LTA is subtracted from the total amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring of parts under the current contract and the difference is allocated to the purchase option. Revenue from options containing a material right is recognized when the amounts billed by the customer for production parts transferred, under the LTA, is less than the standalone selling price of those production parts. Medical Revenues Revenues from our patient temperature management business unit are generated from the sale of products and equipment. Our medical products and equipment focus on body and blood temperature management. The Company sells medical products and equipment primarily through distributor and group purchasing organization agreements. These agreements allow member participants to the distributor or group purchasing organization to make purchases at discounted prices negotiated by the distributor or group purchasing organization. A rebate is incurred at the point in time a member participant purchases product covered under these types of agreements. Rebates are accounted for as variable consideration, using an expected value, probability weighted approach, based on the level of sales to the distributor and the time lag between the initial sale and the rebate claim in determining the transaction price of a contract. Revenue is recognized at the point in time the medical products or equipment is transferred to the customer. GPT and CSZ-IC Revenues Revenues from our divested businesses, GPT and CSZ-IC, were generated from the sale of products and services. GPT and CSZ-IC customers commonly entered into multiple-element agreements for the purchase of products and services. Installation services, for example, were separate and distinct performance obligations that were often included in contracts to purchase customized environmental test chambers. Depending on the application, delivery of an environmental test chamber or remote power generation system to the customer’s place of business could range from two weeks to nine months from commencement of the contract. Installation services, while reliant on the specifications and timing from the customer, rarely remained incomplete more than two months after delivery. Revenues allocated to environmental test chambers or remote power systems were based on the stand-alone selling price of the products themselves. Judgement was used to determine the degree to which early pay discounts and other credits were utilized in the calculation of standalone selling price, and only included to the extent it was probable that a significant reversal of any incremental revenue would not occur. Revenues were recognized at the point in time the chamber or power system was shipped to the customer. For contracts that also included a promise for installation, the portion of total transaction price allocated to the installation was recognized as revenue at the point in time the installation is complete. GPT and CSZ-IC often required milestone payments for contracts to provide environmental test chambers or remote power systems to customers. Milestone payments did not provide the Company with a right to payment for the work completed to date and did not represent the satisfaction of a performance obligation. Milestone payments were deferred and reported within unearned revenue until construction was complete and the unit had been delivered or was installed. If the environmental test chamber contract included a separate promise to provide installation services, any installation-related payments received from the customer were deferred until the point in time the installation was complete. 38 Impairments of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, the Company then compares the fair value of the reporting unit to the related net book value. If the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. The fair value of a reporting unit is estimated by analyzing internal inputs (level 3) to calculate forward values and discounting those values to the present value. Accrued Warranty Costs The Company accrues warranty obligations for products sold based on management estimates of future failure rates and current claim cost experience, with support from the sales, engineering, quality and legal functions. While we believe our warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate, such estimates could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future. The warranty policy is reviewed by management annually. Using historical information available to the Company, including claims already filed by customers, the warranty accrual is adjusted quarterly to reflect management’s best estimate of future claims. Litigation Reserves We record estimated future costs related to new or ongoing litigation based on input from legal counsel and our best estimate of probable loss. These estimates include costs associated with attorney fees and potential claims and assessments less any amounts we anticipate are recoverable under insurance policies. Final resolution of the litigation contingencies could result in amounts different from current accruals and, therefore, have an impact on our consolidated financial results in future reporting periods. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are stated at the invoiced amount, less allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated amounts not expected to be collected, and do not bear interest. We record an allowance for doubtful accounts once exposure to collection risk of an account receivable is specifically identified. We analyze the length of time an account receivable is outstanding, as well as a customer’s payment history and ability to pay to determine the need to record an allowance for doubtful accounts. We write-off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible. Inventory Reserves We recognize a reserve for obsolete and slow-moving inventories based on estimates of future sales and an inventory item’s capacity to be repurposed for a different use. We consider the number of months supply on hand based on current planned requirements, uncommitted future projections and historical usage in estimating the inventory reserve. Additional provisions are made for supplier claims for obsolete materials, prototype inventory, spare or customer service inventory and, for all periods other than at year-end, estimates for physical inventory adjustments. Income Taxes We record income tax expense using the liability method which specifies that deferred tax assets and liabilities be measured each year based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the applicable enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when management considers it more likely than not that the asset will not be realized. If future annual taxable income were to be significantly less than current and projected levels, there is a risk that certain of our deferred tax assets not already provided for by the valuation allowance would expire prior to utilization. We recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Stock Based Compensation We account for grants of employee stock options, time-based restricted stock units and restricted stock as compensation expense based upon the fair value on the date of grant and such expense is recognized over the vesting condition, either based on a period of service of based on the performance of a specific achievement. For option awards measured at fair value, the fair value is determined 39 using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model incorporates certain assumptions, such as expected volatility, expected life of options, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield, in order to arrive at a fair value estimate. Expected volatilities are based on the average of the historical volatility of the Company’s Common Stock and that of an index of companies in our industry group. To evaluate our assumptions for the expected lives of options, we consider the average holding period of previously exercised options and the remaining terms of outstanding options. The risk-free interest rate is based upon quoted market yields for United States Treasury debt securities. The expected dividend yield is based upon the Company’s history of having never issued a dividend, the limitations to issue a dividend under the Amended Credit Agreement and management’s current expectation regarding future dividends. We believe that the assumptions selected by management are reasonable; however, significant changes could materially impact the results of the calculation of fair value. We also have granted restricted stock units measured based on either a target return on invested capital ratio (“ROIC”), as defined in the award agreement, for a specified fiscal year, or the Company’s common stock market price returning a target total shareholder return (“TSR”), as defined, during a specific three-year measurement period. Upon achievement of the performance measurement, performance-based restricted stock units (“PSUs”) vest over a three-year period. Under FASB ASC Topic 718, the provisions of the PSUs that vest upon the achievement of relative TSR are considered a market condition, and therefore the effect of that market condition is reflected in the grant date fair value for this portion award. A third party was engaged to complete a “Monte Carlo simulation” to account for the market condition. That simulation takes into account the beginning stock price of our common stock, the expected volatilities for the TSR comparator group, the expected volatilities for the Company’s stock price, correlation coefficients, the expected risk-free rate of return and the expected dividend yield of the Company and the comparator group. The single grant-date fair value computed by this valuation method is recognized by the Company in accounting for the awards regardless of the actual future outcome of the relative TSR feature. The grant date fair value of the other PSUs and RSUs are calculated as the closing price of our common stock as quoted on Nasdaq on the grant date multiplied by the number of shares subject to the award. ROIC is considered a performance condition and the grant-date fair value for ROIC PSUs corresponds with management's expectation of the probable outcome of the performance condition as of the grant date. Stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) are also an award type granted under our management incentive program and they are accounted for using the liability method since they are settled in cash, which requires mark-to-market adjustments based on the current trading price of Gentherm Common Stock to be recognized in statements of income. Pension Plans The Company’s obligations and expenses for its pension plans are substantially dependent on the Company’s selection of discount rate and, for the Gentherm GmbH Plan, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions used by actuaries to calculate these amounts. Actual results that differ from assumptions used are accumulated and amortized over future periods and generally affect recognized expense in future periods. As such, assumptions used to calculate benefit obligations as of the annual measurement date directly impact the expense to be recognized in future periods. Recent Accounting Pronouncements For a complete description of recent accounting standards which we have not yet been required to implement which may be applicable to our operations, as well as significant accounting standards that have been adopted during the year ended December 31, 2019, see Note 3, “New Accounting Pronouncements” to the consolidated financial statements included in this Report. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements At December 31, 2019, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have, or are, in the opinion of management, reasonably likely to have, a current or future material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 40 Effects of Inflation The automotive component supply industry is subject to inflationary pressures with respect to raw materials and labor, which have historically placed operational and financial burdens on the entire supply chain. Accordingly, the Company continues to take actions with its customers and suppliers to mitigate the impact of these inflationary pressures in the future. Actions to mitigate inflationary pressures with customers include collaboration on alternative product designs and material specifications, contractual price escalation clauses and negotiated customer recoveries. Actions to mitigate inflationary pressures with suppliers include aggregation of purchase requirements to achieve optimal volume benefits, negotiation of cost-reductions and identification of more cost competitive suppliers. While these actions are designed to offset the impact of inflationary pressures, the Company cannot provide assurance that it will be successful in fully offsetting increased costs resulting from inflationary pressure. Contractual Obligations and Commitments The following table summarizes our expected cash outflows resulting from financial contracts and commitments as of December 31, 2019. We have not included information on our recurring purchases of materials for use in our manufacturing operations. These amounts are generally consistent from year to year, closely reflect our levels of production and are not long-term in nature.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations and foreign currency contracts. We have in the past, and may in the future, place our investments in bank certificates of deposits, debt instruments of the U. S. government, and in high-quality corporate issuers. We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, short-term interest rates and price fluctuations of certain material commodities. Market risks for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our debt obligations under our Amended Credit Agreement. Foreign currency exchange risks are attributable to sales to foreign customers and purchases from foreign suppliers not denominated in a location’s functional currency, foreign plant operations, intercompany indebtedness, intercompany investments and include exposures to the Euro, Mexican Peso, Canadian Dollar, Hungarian Forint, Macedonian Denar, Ukrainian Hryvnia, Japanese Yen, Chinese Renminbi, Korean Won and Vietnamese Dong. The Company regularly enters into derivative contracts with the objective of managing its financial and operational exposure arising from these risks by offsetting gains and losses on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the financial instruments used to hedge them. The maximum length of time over which we hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange risks is one year. We had foreign currency derivative contracts with a notional value of $14.4 million and $33.3 million outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 41 We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Our hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedge, and hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions both at the inception of a hedge and on an ongoing basis to be designated for hedge accounting treatment. For derivative contracts which can be classified as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheet. When the underlying hedge transaction is realized, the gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive loss is recorded in earnings in the consolidated statement s of income on the same line as the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. We record the ineffective portion of foreign currency hedging instruments, if any, to foreign currency gain (loss) in the consolidated statements of income. Though we continuously monitor the hedging program, derivative positions and hedging strategies, foreign currency forward exchange agreements have not always been designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. The Company uses an income approach to value derivative instruments, analyzing quoted market prices to calculate the forward values and then discounts such forward values to the present value using benchmark rates at commonly quoted intervals for the instrument’s full term.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Management of the Company, under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer, carried out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2019. As defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (as amended, the “Exchange Act”), disclosure controls and procedures are controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported on a timely basis, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2019. 44 Management’s Report o n Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f), for the Company. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Under the supervision and with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 based on the framework set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in “Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013).” Based on that evaluation, management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2019. In April 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of Stihler Electronic GmbH. (""Stihler"") and is currently integrating Stihler into its operations, compliance programs and internal control processes. Stihler constituted approximately 2% of the Company's total assets as of December 31, 2019, including the goodwill and other intangible assets recorded as part of the purchase price allocation, and less than 1% of the Company's product revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019. SEC rules and regulations allow companies to exclude acquisitions from their assessment of internal control over financial reporting during the first year following an acquisition. The Company has excluded the acquired operations of Stihler from its assessment of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. The attestation report of the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, regarding the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, is set forth in Item 15, ""Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules,"" included under the caption ""Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm"". Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting, that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2019, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Inherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls Our management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well-designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control - Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), and our report dated February 20, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion. Basis for opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical audit matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Goodwill Impairment Assessment – Medical As described further in Note 2 to the financial statements, goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit level. The determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to the forecast of future revenues, operating margins and discount rates. These assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting units, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge or both. We identified the annual goodwill impairment assessment of a reporting unit of the Industrial reporting segment as a critical audit matter (hereafter referred to as the “reporting unit”). The principal consideration for our determination that the annual goodwill impairment assessment of the reporting unit is a critical audit matter is the high degree of auditor judgement necessary in evaluating certain inputs and assumptions made by management in the discounted cash flow analysis. Those assumptions include forecasted revenue of a number of new products the Company plans to introduce to the market beginning in 2020 and after, which contributes significantly to the fair value of the F-2 reporting unit. In addition to forecasted revenues, other inputs and assumptions requiring a high degree of subjectivity include operating margin and the applied discount rate (hereafter referred to collectively as “key inputs and assumptions”). Our audit procedures related to the goodwill impairment assessment of the reporting unit included the following, among others. • We tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls relating to management’s goodwill impairment tests, including controls over the determination of the fair value of the reporting unit and management review controls over the reasonableness of key inputs and assumptions. • We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s forecasts of future revenue and operating margin by comparing these forecasts to historical operating results for the Company’s past performance and performed sensitivity analyses around the forecasted figures. • We utilized a valuation specialist to assess the appropriateness of the impairment methodology used and to test the key inputs and assumptions in the discounted cash flow model. • We compared the key inputs and assumptions to past performance and third-party market data, where relevant. We also evaluated whether such inputs and assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Income Taxes As described in Notes 2 and 9 to the financial statements, the Company is subject to income taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions, and the assessment of tax positions involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations, which are subject to legal and factual interpretation, judgment and uncertainty. The Company recorded a provision for income taxes of $21.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and net deferred tax assets of $56.3 million, including a valuation allowance of $28.8 million and unrecognized tax benefits of $3.8 million as of December 31, 2019. Determining the provision for income taxes and other tax positions require significant management judgments, including the application of complex tax laws and regulations, tax incentives, transfer pricing, tax credits and the realizability of deferred tax assets. We identified income taxes as a critical audit matter. The principal consideration for our determination that income taxes is a critical audit matter is that the matter involved subjective and complex auditor judgment related to the evaluation of management’s conclusions related to tax laws and regulations, transfer pricing and tax credits as they relate to management’s determination of the provision for income taxes and other tax positions. In addition, this matter required significant audit effort in performing our procedures over income taxes, including the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge. Our audit procedures related to income taxes included the following, among others. • We tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls relating to the provision of income taxes and other tax positions, including controls over the calculation of the global tax provision, realizability of deferred tax assets, and assessment of uncertain tax positions. • We tested the provision for income taxes, including the effective tax rate reconciliation and permanent and temporary differences by evaluating communications with tax advisors and regulators, and testing the underlying data for completeness and accuracy. • We evaluated the significant assumptions used by management in establishing and measuring tax-related assets and liabilities, including the application of recent regulations and forecasted taxable income supporting the realizability of deferred tax assets. • We utilized professionals with specialized skill and knowledge to assist in evaluating the application of relevant tax laws, the provision for income taxes, transfer pricing and the reasonableness of management’s assessments of whether certain tax positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained. /s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2007. Southfield, Michigan February 20, 2020 F-3 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Board of Directors and Shareholders Gentherm Incorporated Opinion on internal control over financial reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Gentherm Incorporated (a Michigan corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by COSO. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, and our report dated February 20, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting (“Management’s Report”). Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Our audit of, and opinion on, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting does not include the internal control over financial reporting of Stihler Electronic GmbH, a wholly owned subsidiary, whose financial statements reflect approximately 2% of total assets and less than 1% of revenues of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019. As indicated in Management’s Report, Stihler Electronic GmbH was acquired during 2019. Management’s assertion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting excluded internal control over financial reporting of Stihler Electronic GmbH. Definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. F-4 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate . /s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP Southfield, Michigan February 20, 2020 F-5 GENTHERM INCORPORATED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS (In thousands, except share data)

STATEMENTS (In thousands, except share and per share data) Note 1 — Overview Gentherm Incorporated is a global developer and marketer of innovative thermal management technologies for a broad range of heating and cooling and temperature control applications. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “Gentherm”, “Company”, “we”, “us” and “our” used herein refer to Gentherm Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries. Our products provide solutions for automotive passenger climate comfort and convenience, battery thermal management and cell connecting systems, as well as patient temperature management within the health care industry. Our automotive products can be found on the vehicles of nearly all major automotive manufacturers operating in North America, Europe and Asia. We operate in locations aligned with our major customers’ product strategies to provide locally enhanced design, integration and production capabilities. The Company is also developing a number of new technologies and products that will help enable improvements to existing products and to create new product applications for existing and new markets. On February 1, 2019, the Company completed the divestiture of its environmental test equipment business, Cincinnati Sub Zero industrial chamber business (“CSZ-IC”) and on October 1, 2019, the Company completed the divestiture of its remote power generation systems business, Gentherm Global Power Technologies (“GPT”). The Company’s consolidated financial statements herein include the results of CSZ-IC and GPT through their respective dates of divestiture. CSZ-IC and GPT are not subject to discontinued operations classification. Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation. Notably, $ 10,246 and $ 8,308 in customer relationship amortization was reclassified from product revenues to selling, general and administrative expenses for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and the results from asset disposals during 2017 were reclassified from other income to cost of sales for the year ended December 31, 2017. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly owned subsidiaries and those entities in which it has a controlling financial interest. Investments in affiliates in which Gentherm does not have control but does have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are accounted for under the equity method. When Gentherm does not have the ability to exercise significant influence (generally when ownership interest is less than 20 %), investments in affiliates are measured at cost, less impairments, adjusted for observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Use of Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein. Considerable judgment is involved in making these determinations and the use of different estimates or assumptions could result in significantly different results. Management believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable and appropriate. However, actual results could differ from those reported herein. Segment Reporting The Company has two reportable segments: Automotive , which includes automotive climate comfort systems, specialized automotive cable systems, battery thermal management, and automotive electronic systems; and Industrial . The Industrial segment represents the combined results from our patient temperature management systems business (“Medical”), GPT (through October 1, 2019), CSZ-IC (through February 1, 2019) and Gentherm’s advanced research and development division. The operating results from F-11 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) these businesses and division are presented together as one reporting segment because of their historical joint concentration on identifying new markets and product applications based on thermal management technologies . Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized from agreements containing enforceable rights and obligations, when promised goods are delivered or services are completed. Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, that are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from product revenues. Shipping and handling fees billed to customers are included in product revenues, while costs of shipping and handling are included in cost of sales. Automotive Revenues The Company provides production parts to its customers under long-term supply agreements (“LTAs”). The duration of an LTA is generally consistent with the life cycle of a vehicle; however, an LTA does not reach the level of a performance obligation until Gentherm receives either a purchase order and/or a materials release from the customer for a specific number of production parts at a specified price, at which point an enforceable contract exists. Revenue is recognized when control of the production parts has transferred to the customer according to the terms of the contract, which typically occurs when the parts are shipped or delivered to the customer’s premises. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring production parts. Certain LTAs provide for annual price reductions over the production life of the vehicle. Agreements that are determined to provide customers with purchase option discounts that would not be received without entering into the contract are considered to contain a material right (for example, a discount given to a customer that is incremental to the range of discounts typically given to that class of customer). The material right represents a purchase option that provides the customer with the ability to purchase additional production parts at a set price in the future and is accounted for as a separate performance obligation. Under these circumstances, each transfer of production parts under the LTA requires allocation of the purchase price to the production part and the purchase option. As a practical alternative to estimating the standalone selling price of an option, the Company allocates transaction price to the purchase option by reference to the production part volumes expected to be ordered and the consideration expected to be received over the life of the vehicle program. The production part’s relative standalone selling price observed under the LTA is subtracted from the total amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for transferring of parts under the current contract and the difference is allocated to the purchase option. Revenue from options containing a material right is recognized when the amounts billed by the customer for production parts transferred, under the LTA, is less than the standalone selling price of those production parts. Medical Revenues Revenues from our patient temperature management business unit are generated from the sale of products and equipment. Our medical products and equipment focus on body and blood temperature management. The Company sells medical products and equipment primarily through distributor and group purchasing organization agreements. These agreements allow member participants to the distributor or group purchasing organization to make purchases at discounted prices negotiated by the distributor or group purchasing organization. A rebate is incurred at the point in time a member participant purchases product covered under these types of agreements. Rebates are accounted for as variable consideration, using an expected value, probability weighted approach, based on the level of sales to the distributor and the time lag between the initial sale and the rebate claim in determining the transaction price of a contract. Revenue is recognized at the point in time the medical products or equipment is transferred to the customer. GPT and CSZ-IC Revenues Revenues from our divested businesses, GPT and CSZ-IC, were generated from the sale of products and services. GPT and CSZ-IC customers commonly entered into multiple-element agreements for the purchase of products and services. Installation F-12 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) services, for example, were separate and distinct performance obligations that were often included in contracts to purchase customized environmental test chambers. Depending on the application, delivery of an environmental test chamber or remote power generation system to the customer’s place of business could range from two weeks to nine months from commencement of the contract. Installation services, while reliant on the specifications and timing from the customer, rarely remained incomplete more than two months after delivery. Revenues allocated to environmental test chambers or remote power systems were based on the stand-alone selling price of the products themselves. Judgement was used to determine the degree to which early pay discounts and other credits were utilized in the calculation of standalone selling price, and only included to the extent it was probable that a significant reversal of any incremental revenue would not occur. Revenues were recognized at the point in time the chamber or power system was shipped to the customer. For contracts that also included a promise for installation, the portion of total transaction price allocated to the installation was recognized as revenue at the point in time the installation was complete. GPT and CSZ-IC often required milestone payments for contracts to provide environmental test chambers or remote power systems to customers. Milestone payments did not provide the Company with a right to payment for the work completed to date and did not represent the satisfaction of a performance obligation. Milestone payments were deferred and reported within unearned revenue until construction was complete and the unit had been delivered or was installed. If the environmental test chamber contract included a separate promise to provide installation services, any installation-related payments received from the customer were deferred until the point in time the installation was complete. The total amount of unearned revenue associated with environmental chamber and remote power system contracts, including environmental chamber contracts that included a separate obligation to provide installation, that existed as of December 31, 2018 was $ 5,296 and is classified within Liabilities held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2018. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for information about the assets and liabilities that was classified as held for sale. Assets Recognized from the Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if the benefits of those costs are expected to be realized for a period greater than one year . Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were $ 1,893 and $ 374 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. These amounts are recorded in other current assets and are being amortized into product revenues over the expected production life of the program. During the year ended December 31, 2019, $ 1,006 was amortized into product revenues. During the year ended December 31, 2018, amounts amortized into product revenues was immaterial. Cash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of less than 90 days to be cash equivalents. Cash balances in individual banks may exceed the federally insured limit by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Company had cash and cash equivalents of $ 35,735 and $ 31,976 held in foreign jurisdictions as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Restricted cash includes cash that is legally restricted as to use or withdrawal. Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of financial instruments comprising cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable approximate fair value because of the short maturities of these instruments. The carrying amount of the Company’s U.S. Revolving Note approximates its fair value because interest charged on the loan balance is variable. See Note 15 for information about the techniques used to assess the fair value of financial assets and liabilities, including our fixed rate debt instruments. F-13 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Concentration of Credit Risk Financial assets, which subject the Company to concentration of credit risk, consist primarily of cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable. Cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds managed by major financial services companies. The credit risk for these cash equivalents is considered low. The Company does not require collateral from its customers. As of December 31, 2019, Lear, Adient and Magna comprised 21 %, 21 % and 7 % respectively, of the Company’s accounts receivable balance. As of December 31, 2018, Lear, Adient, and Faurecia comprised 21 %, 18 % and 9 % respectively, of the Company’s accounts receivable balance. These accounts are currently in good standing. Accounts Receivable Accounts receivable are stated at the invoiced amount, less allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated amounts not expected to be collected, and do not bear interest. We record an allowance for doubtful accounts once exposure to collection risk of an account receivable is specifically identified. We analyze the length of time an account receivable is outstanding, as well as a customer’s payment history and ability to pay to determine the need to record an allowance for doubtful accounts. We write-off accounts receivable when they become uncollectible. Inventory The Company’s inventory is measured at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost being determined using the first-in first-out basis. Raw materials, consumables and commodities are measured at cost of purchase and unfinished and finished goods are measured at cost of production, using the weighted average method. If the net realizable value expected on the reporting date is below cost, a write-down is recorded to adjust inventory to its net realizable value. We recognize a reserve for obsolete and slow-moving inventories based on estimates of future sales and an inventory item’s capacity to be repurposed for a different use. We consider the number of months supply on hand based on current planned requirements, uncommitted future projections and historical usage in estimating the inventory reserve. Property and Equipment Property and equipment, including additions and improvements, are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. When property or equipment is retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts. Gains or losses from retirements and disposals are recorded as operating income or expense. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives of the Company’s property and equipment are as follows: Asset Category Useful Life Buildings and improvements 2 to 50 years Plant and equipment 1 to 20 years Production tooling 2 to 10 years Leasehold improvements Term of lease Information technology 1 to 10 years The Company recognized depreciation expense of $ 33,639 , $ 36,270 and $ 32,224 for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. F-14 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in conjunction with business combinations are based on the Company’s estimate of fair value, as of the date of acquisition. Amortization is computed using the straight-line method. The fair value and corresponding useful lives for acquired intangible assets are listed below as follows: Asset Category Useful Life Customer relationships 6 - 15 years Technology 4 - 8 years Product development costs 1 - 15 years Tradenames Indefinite Our business strategy largely centers on designing products based upon internally developed and purchased technology. When possible and having value to the business strategy, we protect these technologies with patents. Our policy is to expense all costs associated with the development and issuance of new patents as incurred. Such costs are classified as research and development expenses in our consolidation statements of income. Patents purchased as part of a business combination are capitalized based on their fair values. Periodically, we review the recoverability and remaining lives of our capitalized patents, and if necessary, make adjustments to reported amounts, based upon unfavorable impacts from market conditions, the emergence of competitive technologies and changes in our projected business plans. Impairments of Long-Lived Assets, Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill Whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that a long-lived asset’s fair value, other intangible asset’s fair value or a reporting unit’s fair value is less than it’s carrying amount, the Company then compares the fair value of the long-lived asset, other intangible asset or reporting unit to the related net book value. If the net book value of a long-lived asset, other intangible asset or reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. The fair value of a long-lived asset, other intangible asset or reporting unit is estimated by analyzing internal inputs (level 3) to calculate forward values and discounting those values to the present value. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment on at least an annual basis. Accrued Warranty Costs The Company accrues warranty obligations for products sold based on management estimates of future failure rates and current claim cost experience, with support from the sales, engineering, quality and legal functions. Using historical information available to the Company, including claims already filed by customers, the warranty accrual is adjusted quarterly to reflect management’s best estimate of future claims. Tooling The Company incurs costs related to tooling used in the manufacture of products sold to its customers. In some cases, the Company enters into contracts with its customers whereby the Company incurs the costs to design, develop and purchase tooling and is then reimbursed by the customer under a reimbursement contract. Tooling costs that will be reimbursed by customers are included in other current assets at the lower of accumulated cost or the customer reimbursable amount. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, $ 5,347 and $ 6,628 of reimbursable tooling was capitalized within other current assets. Company-owned tooling is included in property and equipment and depreciated over its expected useful life, generally two to ten years . Management periodically F-15 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) evaluates the recoverability of tooling costs, based on estimated future cash flows, and makes provisions, where appropriate, for tooling costs that will not be recovered. Research and Development Expenses Research and development activities are expensed as incurred. The Company groups development and prototype costs and related reimbursements in research and development. The Company recognizes amounts due as reimbursements for expenses as these expenses are incurred. Leases The Company has operating leases for office, manufacturing and research and development facilities, as well as land leases for certain manufacturing facilities that are accounted for as operating leases. We also have operating leases for office equipment and automobiles. Excluding land leases, our leases have remaining lease terms ranging from less than 1 year to 7 years and may include options to extend the lease for an additional term equal to the original term of the lease. Land leases have remaining lease terms that range from 41 to 43 years and some which specify that the end of the lease term is at the discretion of the lessee. We do not have lease arrangements with related parties. The Company determines whether a contractual arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Leases that are operating in nature are recognized in operating lease right-of-use assets, current lease liabilities and non-current lease liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. While Gentherm is not currently party to any leases that qualify as financing leases, right-of-use assets and liabilities recognized from financing leases would be presented separately from the right-of-use assets and liabilities recognized from operating leases on our consolidated balance sheet. Lease liabilities are measured initially at the present value of the sum of the future minimum rental payments at the commencement date of the lease. Lease payments that will vary in the future due to changes in facts and circumstances are excluded from the calculation of rental payments, unless those variable payments are based on an index or rate. Rental payments are discounted using an incremental borrowing rate based on the Company’s credit rating, determined on a fully collateralized loan basis from information available at commencement date, and the duration of the lease term (the “reference rate”). Judgement is used to assess the importance of risk factor inputs during the computation of the Company’s credit rating. For significant leases at foreign subsidiaries denominated in U.S. Dollars, a risk premium associated with the borrower subsidiary’s country is added to the reference rate. For significant leases at foreign subsidiaries denominated in a foreign currency, the U.S. Dollar risk free rate with a duration similar to that of the lease term is subtracted from the reference rate and a corresponding foreign currency risk free rate with a duration similar to that of the lease term is added to the reference rate. Judgement is used to determine whether foreign subsidiary leases are significant. Operating lease right-of-use assets are measured at the amount of the lease liability, adjusted for prepaid or accrued lease payments, lease incentive received, and initial direct costs incurred, as applicable. Periods covered by an option to extend the lease are initially included in the measurement of an operating lease right-of-use asset and lease liability only when it is reasonably certain we will exercise the option. Gentherm’s lease agreements do not contain residual value guarantees or impose restrictions or covenants on the Company. For all classes of underlying assets, the Company accounts for leases that contain separate lease and non-lease components as containing a single lease component. The Company does not recognize lease right-of-use assets and lease liabilities from leases with an original lease term of 12 months or less and, instead, recognizes rent payments on a straight-line basis over the lease term in the Company’s consolidated statements of income. Income Taxes The Company records income tax expense using the liability method which specifies that deferred tax assets and liabilities be measured each year based on the difference between the financial statement and tax base of assets and liabilities at the applicable enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when management considers it more likely than not that F-16 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) the asset will not be realized. At December 31, 201 9 and 201 8 , a valuation allowance has been provided for certain deferred tax assets which the Company has concluded are more likely than not to not be realized. If future annual taxable income were to be significantly less than current and projected levels, there is a risk that certain of our deferred tax assets not already provided for by the valuation allowance would expire prior to utilization. The Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. Derivative Financial Instruments – Hedge Accounting The Company accounts for some of its derivative financial instruments as cash flow hedges as defined in Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 815. For derivative contracts which can be classified as a cash flow hedge, the effective potion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets. When the underlying hedge transaction is realized, the gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income is recorded in earnings in the consolidated statements of income on the same line as the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. Any ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognized in the consolidated statements of income under foreign currency gain (loss) or revaluation of derivatives gain (loss). These hedging transactions and the respective correlations meet the requirements for hedge accounting. Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the respective period. The Company’s diluted earnings per common share give effect to all potential shares of Common Stock outstanding during a period that are not anti-dilutive. In computing the number of diluted shares outstanding, the treasury stock method is used in order to arrive at a net number of shares created upon the conversion of Common Stock equivalents. Stock Based Compensation Share based payments that involve the issuance of Common Stock to employees, including grants of employee stock options, restricted stock, and time-based and performance-based restricted stock units, are recognized in the financial statements as compensation expense based upon the fair value on the date of grant. Performance-based restricted stock unit awards are measured based on either a target return on invested capital ratio (“ROIC”), as defined in the award agreement, for a specified fiscal year, or the Company’s common stock market price returning a target total shareholder return (“TSR”), as defined, during a specific three-year measurement period. Upon achievement of the performance measurement, performance-based restricted stock units vest over a three-year period. Share based payments that are satisfied only by the payment of cash, such as stock appreciation rights, are accounted for as liabilities. The liability is reported at market value of the vested portion of the underlying units. During each period, the change in the liability is recorded as compensation expense during periods when the liability increases or income during periods in which the liability decreases. Pension Plans The Company’s obligations and expenses for its pension plans are dependent on the Company’s selection of discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and other assumptions used by actuaries to calculate these amounts. F-17 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale The Company classifies assets and liabilities (disposal groups) to be sold as held for sale in the period in which all of the following criteria are met: management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the disposal group; the disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such disposal groups; an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the disposal group have been initiated; the sale of the disposal group is probable, and transfer of the disposal group is expected to qualify as a completed sale within one year, except if events or circumstances beyond the Company’s control extend the period of time required to sell the disposal group beyond one year; the disposal group is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. The Company initially measures a disposal group that is classified as held for sale at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell. Any loss resulting from this measurement is recognized in the period in which the held for sale criteria are met. Gains are not recognized on the sale of a disposal group until the date of sale. The Company assesses the fair value of a disposal group, less any costs to sell, each reporting period it remains classified as held for sale and reports any subsequent losses as an adjustment to the carrying value of the disposal group. The Company reports assets and liabilities of the disposal group in the line items assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in the period the disposal group meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for information about the assets and liabilities classified as held for sale. Note 3 — New Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Leases In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842)” (as amended, “ASU 2016-02”). ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset on the balance sheet for all leases, except for short-term leases with terms of twelve months or less. The lease liability represents the lessee’s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, and is measured as the present value of the lease payments. The right-of-use asset represents the lessee’s right to use a specified asset for the lease term, and is measured at the lease liability amount, adjusted for lease prepayment, lease incentives received and the lessee’s initial direct costs. Leases are to be classified as finance or operating leases, with classification affecting the pattern and classification of expense recognition in the statements of income (loss). The Company adopted ASU 2016-02 on January 1, 2019, by applying the modified retrospective method and recognized a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance in retained earnings. Financial information has not been updated and disclosures under the new standard have not been provided to dates and periods before January 1, 2019 , and the Company’s reporting for the comparative periods in the consolidated financial statements will continue to be in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification Topic 840, Leases (“ASC 840”). F-18 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) ASU 2016-02 did not have a presentation impact on the Company’s consolidated statements of income or cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019 but did have a n impact on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019. The cumulative effects of the changes made to the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of January 1, 2019 for the adoption of ASU 2016-02 were as follows: Balance as of December 31, 2018 Adjustments due to adoption of ASU 2016-02 Balance as of January 1, 2019 Other current assets $ 54,363 $ ( 74 ) $ 54,289 Assets held for sale 69,699 4,127 73,826 Operating lease right-of-use assets — 13,019 13,019 Liabilities held for sale 13,062 4,136 17,198 Deferred income tax liabilities 1,177 114 1,291 Non-current lease liabilities — 12,561 12,561 Accumulated earnings 363,965 261 364,226 The Company elected the package of practical expedients provided in ASU 2016-02, which permits a lessee to not reassess under the new standard its prior conclusions about lease identification, lease classification and initial direct costs. Gentherm elected the use-of-hindsight to determine whether lease terms included periods covered by the lessee’s option to extend or terminate a lease, whether to purchase the underlying asset at the end of the lease agreement, and in assessing impairment of operating lease right-of-use assets. Finally, Gentherm elected to not assess whether existing or expired land easements that were not previously accounted for as leases are or contain a lease. Land easements previously accounted for as leases were not eligible for this practical expedient. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted Expected Credit Losses In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” ASU 2016-13 requires the measurement of all expected credit losses for financial assets held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption of the amendments in this update is permitted. The Company is currently in the process of determining the impact the implementation of ASU 2016-13 will have on the consolidated financial statements and note disclosures. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Cloud Computing Arrangements That Are Service Contracts In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, “Intangibles – Goodwill and Other – Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract.” ASU 2018-15 requires implementation costs incurred by customers in cloud computing arrangements to be deferred and recognized over the term of the arrangement if those costs would be capitalized by the customer in a software licensing arrangement under the internal-use software guidance. ASU 2018-15 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption of the amendments in this update is permitted. We are currently in the process of determining the impact the implementation of ASU 2018-15 will have on the Company’s financial statements and note disclosures. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Retirement Benefits In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, “Compensation – Retirement Benefits – Defined Benefit Plans – General (Subtopic 715-20): Disclosure Framework – Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans.” ASU 2018-14 removes certain disclosure requirements, including (i) the amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income expected to be F-19 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year, and (ii) the amount and timing of plan assets expected to be returned to the employer. ASU 2018-14 also adds new disclosure requirements, including (i) the weighted-average interest crediting rates for cash balance plans and other plans with promised interest crediting rates and (ii) an explanation of the reasons for significant gains and losses related to changes in the benefit obligation for the period. ASU 2018-14 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2020. Early adoption of the amendments in this update is permitted. We are currently in the process of determining the impact the implementation of ASU 2018-14 will have on the Company’s financial statement note disclosures. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Fair Value Measurement In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework – Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement.” ASU 2018-13 removes certain disclosure requirements, including (i) the amount of and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, (ii) the policy for timing of transfer between levels, and (iii) the valuation processes for Level 3 fair value measurements. ASU 2018-13 also adds new disclosure requirements, including (i) the changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period included in other comprehensive income for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements held at the end of the reporting period and (ii) the range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements. ASU 2018-13 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption of disclosures that are removed is permitted, but adoption is delayed for the new additional disclosures until their effective date. We are currently in the process of determining the impact the implementation of ASU 2018-13 will have on the Company’s financial statement note disclosures. The adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Note 4 – Acquisitions and Divestitures In June 2018, Gentherm announced a new strategic plan. An important element of the strategy was the elimination of investments in non-core areas, including GPT and CSZ-IC. The strategy also identified several product categories the Company exited in 2018, including furniture, aviation, battery management electronics, industrial battery packs, automotive thermoelectric generators and other non-core electronics. During the year ended December 31, 2018, Gentherm determined that GPT and CSZ-IC met the held for sale criteria and recognized $ 11,476 of asset impairment charges, consisting of $ 6,151 of goodwill impairment charges, $ 3,135 of other intangible asset impairment charges and $ 2,190 of impairment on assets held for sale. These impairment charges are reported within Industrial segment and are classified as Asset impairments and net loss on divestitures within the consolidated statements of income. Divestiture of CSZ-IC On February 1, 2019, the Company completed the sale of CSZ-IC and former Cincinnati Sub-Zero headquarters facility to Weiss Technik North America, Inc. for total cash proceeds of $ 47,500 , including $ 2,500 of cash proceeds placed into an escrow account for a period of up to one year as partial security for the Company’s obligations under the sale agreement. In connection with the sale, Gentherm entered into an operating lease agreement for a portion of the office and manufacturing building space purchased by Weiss Technik North America, Inc. The Company recognized a $ 4,298 pre-tax gain on the sale of CSZ-IC for the year ended December 31, 2019 which is classified as Asset impairments and net loss on divestitures within the consolidated statements of income. Subsequent to December 31, 2019, claims were made against the cash proceeds held in the escrow account. The Company is not able to estimate the possible loss, if any, of amounts held in escrow in connection with this matter. Divestiture of GPT During 2019, the Company continued to assess the fair value of the GPT disposal group, less costs to sell, at each reporting period. As a result of these fair value measurements, the Company recognized additional impairment losses of $ 21,206 consisting of F-20 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) $ 4,486 of impairment of an equity investment that met the held for sale criteria during 2019 and $ 16,720 of impairment on assets held for sale . These impairment charges are classified as Asset impairments and net loss on divestitures within the consolidated statements of income. On October 1, 2019, the Company completed the sale of GPT for a nominal amount and recognized a $ 5,885 loss on sale for the year ended December 31, 2019, which included $ 3,995 related to the release of previously deferred foreign currency translation losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and $ 1,500 related to a loan to the buyer that was considered uncollectible. Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale as of December 31, 2018 – CSZ-IC and GPT The assets and liabilities of the disposal group classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2018 were as follows: Accounts receivable, less allowance of $ 96 $ 10,868 Inventory, net 13,925 Prepaid expenses and other assets 263 Property and equipment, net 29,459 Goodwill 6,844 Other intangible assets, net 6,326 Deferred income tax assets 4,204 Other non-current assets — Impairment loss ( 2,190 ) Total assets for sale 69,699 Accounts payable 2,614 Accrued liabilities 10,448 Total liabilities for sale $ 13,062 Acquisition of Stihler Electronic GmbH On April 1, 2019, Gentherm acquired Stihler Electronic GmbH (“Stihler”), a leading developer and manufacturer of patient and blood temperature management systems, for a purchase price of $ 15,476 , net of cash acquired and including $ 653 of contingent consideration to be paid upon achievement of a milestone that must be completed by September 2020. In addition, the purchase agreement includes a contingent payment of $ 653 to be paid if the selling shareholder remains employed by Stihler through December 2020. This amount is being recognized as a component of selling, general and administrative expenses ratably over the service period. The results of operations of Stihler are reported within the Company’s Industrial segment from the date of acquisition. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company incurred acquisition-related costs of approximately $ 324 . These amounts were recorded as incurred, within the Company's consolidated statements of income. F-21 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) The acquisition was accounted for as a business combination. The purchase price and related allocation to the acquired net assets of Stihler, based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date, are shown below: Purchase price, cash consideration, net of cash acquired $ 14,823 Purchase price, fair value of contingent consideration 653 Total purchase price, net of cash acquired 15,476 Accounts receivable 883 Inventory 1,698 Prepaid expenses and other assets 241 Operating lease right-of-use assets 263 Property and equipment 260 Other intangible assets 4,380 Goodwill 9,816 Assumed liabilities ( 2,065 ) Net assets acquired $ 15,476 Other intangible assets primarily include amounts recognized for the fair value of customer-related intangible assets, which will be amortized over their estimated useful lives of approximately 9 years. The estimated fair value of these assets was based on third-party valuations and management’s estimates, generally utilizing an income approach. Goodwill recognized in this transaction is primarily attributable to intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. It is estimated that $ 2,524 of the goodwill recognized will be deductible for income tax purposes. The pro forma effect of the Stihler acquisition does not materially impact the Company’s reported results for any period presented, and as a result no pro forma financial statements are presented. Acquisition of Etratech On November 1, 2017, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed substantially all of the operating liabilities of Etratech Inc., an Ontario corporation and all of the outstanding shares of Etratech Hong Kong, an entity organized under the laws of Hong Kong, in an all-cash transaction for a purchase price of $ 65,009 , net of cash acquired of $ 670 . Etratech manufactures advanced electronic controls and control systems for the automotive, RV and marine, security, medical and other industries. Results of operations for Etratech are reported within the Company’s Automotive segment from the date of acquisition. Etratech contributed $ 8,398 in product revenues and a net loss of $ 510 for the year ended December 31, 2017. Supplemental Pro Forma Information The unaudited pro forma combined historical results including the amounts of Etratech revenue and earnings that would have been included in the Company’s consolidated statements of income had the acquisition date been January 1, 2017 is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2017 Product revenues $ 1,032,273 Net income $ 35,911 Basic earnings per share $ 0.98 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.98 This pro forma information is not indicative of future operating results. F-22 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Note 5 — Restructuring Manufacturing Footprint Rationalization On September 23, 2019, the Company committed to a restructuring plan to improve the Company’s manufacturing productivity and rationalize its footprint. Under this plan, the Company will relocate and consolidate certain existing automotive manufacturing and, as a result, certain other activities, overall reducing the number of plants by two. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized expense of $ 4,863 for employee separation costs that will be paid pursuant to the terms of statutory requirements of the affected locations. Additionally, the Company recognized $ 2,087 of accelerated depreciation and fixed asset impairment. The Company expects to incur total costs of between $ 20,000 and $ 24,000 , of which between $ 17,000 and $ 21,000 are expected to be cash expenditures. The total expected costs include employee separation costs of between $ 9,000 and $ 11,000 , capital expenditures of between $ 4,500 and $ 5,500 and non-cash expenses for accelerated depreciation and impairment of fixed assets of $ 3,000 . The Company also expects to incur other transition costs including recruiting, relocation, and machinery and equipment move and set up costs of between $ 3,500 and $ 4,500 . The actions under this plan are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2021. The actual timing, costs and savings of the Plan may differ materially from the Company’s current expectations and estimates. Other Restructuring Activities As part of the Company’s continued efforts to optimize its cost structure, the Company has undertaken several discrete restructuring actions. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the Company recognized $ 2,942 and $ 6,598 of employee separation costs, respectively, and $ 1,360 and $ 2,869 of other related costs, respectively. These restructuring expenses were primarily associated with restructuring actions focused on the rotation of our manufacturing footprint to lower cost locations and the reduction of global overhead costs. These discrete restructuring actions are expected to approximate the total cumulative costs for those actions. The Company will continue to explore opportunities to improve its future profitability and competitiveness. These actions may result in the recognition of additional restructuring charges that could be material. Advanced Research and Development Rationalization and Site Consolidation In June 2018, Gentherm completed the sale of its battery management systems division located in Irvine, California. A loss on the sale of $ 1,107 was recognized in restructuring expenses during the year ended December 31, 2018. An additional asset impairment loss of $ 425 was recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019. During the year ended December 31, 2018, Gentherm recognized employee separation costs of $ 1,094 , and $ 643 of other related costs associated with the closure of two leased facilities located in Azusa, California. The Company also recognized $ 1,400 in restructuring expenses for the year ended December 31, 2018 for the disposal of long-lived assets controlled and used in Azusa, California. The Company has recorded approximately $ 4,669 of restructuring expenses since inception of this program and it is considered complete. GPT and CSZ-IC During 2018, Gentherm launched a program to actively market GPT and CSZ-IC. Costs associated with the divestiture process were classified as restructuring. During the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , the Company recognized $ 251 and $ 757 of employee separation costs, respectively, and $ 991 and $ 304 of other related costs, respectively. The Company has recorded approximately $ 2,303 of restructuring expenses since inception of this program and it is considered substantially complete.

Note 7 — Segment Reporting Segment information is used by management for making operating decisions for the Company. Management evaluates the performance of the Company’s segments based primarily on operating income or loss. The Company’s reportable segments are as follows: • Automotive — this segment represents the design, development, manufacturing and sales of automotive climate comfort systems, specialized automotive cable systems, battery thermal management, and automotive electronic systems. • Industrial — this segment represents the combined results from our Medical business, GPT (through October 1, 2019), CSZ-IC (through February 1, 2019) and Gentherm’s advanced research and development division. The operating results from these businesses and division are presented together as one reporting segment because of their historical joint concentration on identifying new markets and product applications based on thermal management technologies. • Reconciling Items — include corporate selling, general and administrative costs and acquisition transaction costs.

Contract Balances We record a receivable when revenue is recognized at the time of invoicing and unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. For contracts where control of the goods or service is transferred to the customer over time, or whose terms required the customer to make milestone payments throughout the fulfillment period, the timing of revenue recognition is likely to differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. Most of Gentherm’s unearned revenue pertains to LTAs containing a material right. In the early periods of an LTA containing a material right, when payments collected from the customer are greater than the standalone selling price of the production parts, revenue associated with the material right is deferred. In future periods, when amounts collected from customers as payment is less than the standalone selling price of the production parts delivered, the deferred revenue is reversed into revenue. For LTAs containing a material right and, thus, the timing of revenue recognition is likely to differ from the timing of invoicing to customer, the aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to material rights that remained unsatisfied under LTAs as of December 31, 2019 was $ 579 . We expect to recognize into revenue, 69 % of this balance in 2020, and the remaining 11 %, 11 % and 9 % in 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. Unearned revenue by segment was as follows: December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Automotive $ 579 $ 1,597 Industrial — — Total $ 579 $ 1,597 F-27 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Changes in unearned revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 were as follows: Balance, beginning of period $ 1,597 Additions to unearned revenue 234 Reclassified to revenue ( 1,238 ) Currency impacts ( 14 ) Balance, end of period $ 579 Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represent contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. Note 9 — Income Taxes U.S. Tax Reform The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate from 35 % to 21 % beginning in 2018, required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on all offshore earnings that were previously tax deferred and created new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. In March 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-05, “Income Taxes – Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118”. The guidance provided for a provisional one-year measurement period for entities to finalize their accounting for certain tax effects related to the Tax Act. As of December 31, 2017, the Company made a provisional estimate of $ 20,153 for the effects on our existing deferred tax balances, the one-time transition tax and our indefinite reinvestment assertion regarding foreign subsidiary earnings in accordance with the guidance. As of December 31, 2018, the Company evaluated the provisional amounts initially recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017 and recorded adjustments based on updates to the Company’s assumptions and the application of additional interpretative guidance as issued during 2018. The adjustments are primarily a result of refining the net deferred tax asset position with the completion of our 2017 U.S. income tax return and changing tax accounting methods that affected the timing of certain US tax deductions. These adjustments resulted in (i) a decrease in our existing deferred tax asset balances which resulted in an income tax expense of $ 4,950 and (ii) a net increase to the one-time transition tax which resulted in an income tax expense of $ 24,625 . No adjustment was required to the $ 9,578 tax benefit included in the provision for income taxes as of December 31, 2017 to offset the one-time transition tax related to the previous deferred tax liability that existed for the undistributed foreign earnings that were not permanently reinvested. As of December 31, 2018, the total income tax expense was $ 19,997 for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the provisional estimate of $ 20,153 . The Company also analyzed the impact of several new provisions of the Tax Act that became effective as of January 1, 2018, such as global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) provision, foreign-derived intangible income (“FDII”) deduction, a new minimum tax related to payment to foreign subsidiaries and affiliates known as base erosion anti-abuse tax (“BEAT”), interest expense limitations under Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) section 163(j), executive compensation limitations under IRC section 162(m) and various other provisions. The GILTI provision imposes a tax on certain earnings of foreign subsidiaries. U.S. GAAP allows companies to make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferred taxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or to provide for the tax expense related to GILTI in the year the tax is incurred. We have elected to account for GILTI in the year the tax is incurred. F-28 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) The deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities and related valuation allowance were comprised of the following: December 31, 2019 2018 Deferred tax assets: Net operating losses $ 17,881 $ 7,666 Intangible assets 33,609 42,853 Research and development credits 9,752 8,211 Depreciation 7,223 6,321 Valuation reserves and accrued liabilities 7,196 4,849 Foreign tax credit 262 376 Stock compensation 3,485 4,128 Inventory 1,284 1,069 Patents 134 150 Defined benefit obligation 2,027 1,796 Other credits 11,491 3,701 Other $ 114 89 Total deferred tax asset 94,458 81,209 Valuation allowance ( 28,763 ) ( 9,977 ) Deferred tax liabilities: Unrealized foreign currency exchange gains ( 674 ) ( 554 ) Undistributed profits of subsidiary ( 4,629 ) ( 4,352 ) Property and equipment ( 3,366 ) ( 2,896 ) Other ( 733 ) ( 583 ) Total deferred tax liability ( 9,402 ) ( 8,385 ) Net deferred tax asset $ 56,293 $ 62,847 Reconciliations between the statutory Federal income tax rate and the effective rate of income tax expense for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 are as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Statutory Federal income tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 34.0 % Increase (decrease) resulting from: Change in Valuation Allowance 30.7 % ( 6.6 )% 10.6 % Effect of different tax rates of foreign jurisdictions ( 24.8 )% ( 6.6 )% ( 20.8 )% US Tax Reform Items 4.3 % 10.8 % 29.1 % Research and Development Credits ( 2.3 )% ( 2.5 )% ( 4.6 )% Non-deductible expenses 2.1 % 3.4 % 2.4 % Foreign, state and local tax, net of Federal benefit 1.7 % 1.8 % 0.8 % Tax effects of intercompany transfers 1.5 % 0.8 % ( 5.0 )% Undistributed profit of subsidiaries 1.2 % 1.2 % 5.8 % Other 1.2 % 4.6 % ( 1.0 )% Stock Compensation Expense 0.0 % 0.0 % ( 2.2 )% Effective Rate 36.6 % 27.9 % 49.1 % F-29 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) The Company has Net Operating Loss (“NOL”) carryforwards as follows: Jurisdiction Amount as of December 31, 2019 Years of Expiration U.S. Federal and state income tax $ 85,828 2020-2039 Foreign $ 13,153 2020-2024 Foreign $ 109,665 Never A portion of the U.S. Federal NOLs was incurred prior to the June 8, 1999 Preferred Financing, which qualified as a change in ownership under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”). Due to this change in ownership, the NOL accumulated prior to the change in control can only be utilized against current earnings up to a maximum annual limitation of approximately $ 591 . As a result of the annual limitation, approximately $ 19,349 in NOLs generated prior to the change in control have already expired without being utilized. No further NOL is available to be utilized in future periods. We have incurred NOLs in various states associated with the benefits of the state dividends received reduction along with the foreign royalty exclusion. The state net operating loss carryforwards expire at various dates from 2020 to 2039 . Management has concluded that it is more likely than not that a majority of these NOLs will not be utilized, and thus has not recognized the benefit of these NOLs. At December 31, 2019, certain non-U.S. subsidiaries have net operating loss carryforwards totaling $ 122,818 . This amount includes $ 13,153 in NOLs that expire at various dates from 2020 through 2024 and the remaining $ 109,665 have no expiration date . The Company has a valuation allowance recorded against $ 110,012 of the total non-U.S. subsidiaries’ net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2019. The earnings before income taxes and our tax provision are comprised of the following: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Income (loss) before income taxes: Domestic $ 74,531 $ 10,092 $ 1,258 Foreign ( 15,380 ) 48,027 67,997 Total income before income taxes $ 59,151 $ 58,119 $ 69,255 Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Current income tax expense (benefit): Federal $ 262 $ 340 $ 4,140 State and local 94 ( 71 ) 150 Foreign 17,672 9,224 24,672 Total current income tax expense 18,028 9,493 28,962 Deferred income tax expense (benefit): Federal ( 2,490 ) ( 1,422 ) 15,207 State and local ( 1 ) 20 2,308 Foreign 6,108 8,129 ( 12,449 ) Total deferred income tax expense 3,617 6,727 5,066 Total tax expense $ 21,645 $ 16,220 $ 34,028 F-30 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) As of December 31, 2019, deferred income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries since these earnings will not be taxable upon repatriation to the United States. These earnings will be primarily treated as previously taxed income from either the one-time transition tax or GILTI, or they will be offset with a 100 % dividend received deduction. However, the Company continues to provide a deferred tax liability for foreign withholding tax that will be incurred with respect to the undistributed foreign earnings that are not permanently reinvested. The Company is subject to taxation in the United States and various state and foreign jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2019, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. Federal examinations by tax authorities for tax years before 2015 and is no longer subject to foreign examinations by tax authorities for tax years before 2012. During 2015, to entice the Company to construct a new facility in Macedonia, the government of Macedonia granted the Company a tax holiday that released the Company from the obligation to pay corporate income taxes for a ten year period, subject to certain limitations. The amount of corporate income tax savings realized by the Company as a result of this tax holiday during 2019 and 2018, respectively, was zero as a result of operating losses generated during previous periods. The aggregate dollar effect and per share effect of the corporate income tax holiday during 2019 and 2018 was, therefore, immaterial. At December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the Company had total unrecognized tax benefits of $ 3,795 , $ 2,819 and $ 3,812 , respectively, all of which, if recognized, would affect the effective income tax rates. The reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Balance at beginning of year $ 2,819 $ 3,812 $ 3,877 Additions based on tax position related to current year 661 221 1,758 Additions based on tax position related to prior year 352 423 ( 105 ) Reductions from settlements and statute of limitation expiration — ( 1,469 ) ( 2,247 ) Effect of foreign currency translation ( 37 ) ( 168 ) 529 Balance at end of year $ 3,795 $ 2,819 $ 3,812 The Company classifies income tax-related penalties and net interest as income tax expense. In the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 income tax related interest and penalties were insignificant. It is reasonably possible that audit settlements, the conclusions of current examinations or the expiration of the statute of limitations in several jurisdictions could impact the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits. If recognized, all of the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits would affect the Company’s effective tax rate. Note 10 — Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefit Plans The Company maintains a U.S. defined benefit pension plan covering its former Chief Executive Officer (“U.S. Plan”) and a German defined benefit pension plan covering certain retired executive employees of the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Gentherm GmbH (“German Plan”).

Actuarial gains or losses are amortized to selling, general and administrative expense in the Company’s consolidated statements of income based on the average future life of the Plan using the corridor method. Prior service cost is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of income. Plan assets – German Plan Plan assets are comprised of Gentherm GmbH’s pension insurance policies and are pledged to the beneficiaries of the German Plan. A market valuation technique, based on observable underlying insurance charges, is used to determine the fair value of the pension plan assets (Level 2). The expected return on plan assets assumption used to calculate Gentherm GmbH’s pension benefit obligation was determined using actual returns realized on plan assets in the prior year. Other assets Although the U.S. Plan is not funded, the Company has established a separate trust having the sole purpose of paying benefits under the U.S. Plan. The only asset of the trust is a corporate-owned life insurance policy (“COLI”). The COLI is valued at fair value using quoted prices listed in active markets (Level 1). The policy value of the COLI was $ 2,592 and $ 2,148 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and is included in other non-current assets in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Contributions We do no t expect contributions to be paid to the U.S. Plan or the German Plan during the next fiscal year. The schedule of future expected pension payments is as follows: Projected Pension Benefit Payments Year U.S Plan German Plan 2020 $ 342 $ 289 2021 342 287 2022 342 283 2023 342 293 2024 342 287 2025-2029 1,710 2,839 Total $ 3,420 $ 4,278 F-33 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Defined contribution plans The Company also sponsors defined contribution plans for eligible employees.

On June 27, 2019, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Amended Credit Agreement”) with a consortium of lenders and Bank of America, N.A. as administrative agent. The Amended Credit Agreement amended and restated in its entirety the Credit Agreement. The outstanding principal and interest of the U.S. Revolving Note under the Credit Agreement continued and constitute obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement. The Amended Credit Agreement increased the U.S. Revolving Note from $ 350,000 to $ 475,000 and extended the maturity from March 17, 2021 to June 27, 2024 . Subject to specified conditions, the Company can increase the U.S. Revolving Note or incur secured term loans in an aggregate amount of $ 175,000 . The Amended Credit Agreement also provides $ 15,000 availability for the issuance of letters of credit and a maximum of $ 40,000 for swing line borrowing. Any amount of the facility utilized for letters of credit or swing line loans outstanding will reduce the amount available under the Amended Credit Agreement. The Company had $ 0 and $ 455 of outstanding letters of credit issued under the Amended Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The U.S. borrowers and guarantors participating in the Amended Credit Agreement have entered into a related amended and restated pledge and security agreement. The amended and restated pledge and security agreement grants a security interest to the lenders in substantially all of the personal property of the Company and its U.S. subsidiaries designated as borrowers to secure their respective obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement, including the stock and membership interests of specified subsidiaries (limited to 66 % of the stock in the case of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries). In addition to the security obligations, all obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement are unconditionally guaranteed by certain of the Company’s subsidiaries. The Amended Credit Agreement restricts, among other things, the amount of dividend payments the Company can make to shareholders. The Amended Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants that will prohibit or limit the ability of the Borrowers and any material subsidiary to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, create liens, pay dividends, make certain types of investments (including acquisitions), enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates, prepay other indebtedness, sell assets, merge with other companies or enter into certain other transactions outside the ordinary course of business requires the Company and its subsidiaries to comply with customary affirmative and negative covenants, and contain customary events of default. These restrictions on the Company’s material subsidiaries have not had and are not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s ability to meet its cash obligations. The Amended Credit Agreement also requires the Company to maintain a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio and Consolidated Leverage Ratio, as defined in the agreement. Under the Amended Credit Agreement, U.S. Dollar denominated loans bear interest at either a base rate (“Base Rate Loans”) or Eurocurrency rate (“Eurocurrency Rate Loans”), plus a margin (“Applicable Rate”). The rate for Base Rate Loans is equal to the highest of the Federal Funds Rate ( 1.55 % at December 31, 2019) plus 0.50 %, Bank of America’s prime rate ( 4.75 % at December 31, 2019), or the Eurocurrency rate plus 1.00 %. The rate for Eurocurrency Rate Loans denominated in U.S. Dollars is equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate ( 1.76 % at December 31, 2019). All loans denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar must be Eurocurrency Rate Loans. Interest is payable at least quarterly. The Applicable Rate varies based on the Consolidated Leverage Ratio reported by the Company. As long as the Company is not in default of the terms and conditions of the Amended Credit Agreement, the lowest and highest possible Applicable Rate is 1.25 % and 2.25 %, respectively, for Eurocurrency Rate Loans and 0.25 % and 1.25 %, respectively, for Base Rate Loans. In connection with the Amended Credit Agreement, the Company incurred debt issuance costs of $ 1,278 which have been capitalized and will be amortized into interest expense over the term of the credit facility. F-37 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) DEG Vietnam Loan The Company also has a fixed interest rate loan with the German Investment Corporation (“DEG”), a subsidiary of KfW Banking Group, a Germany government-owned development bank. The fixed interest rate senior loan agreement with DEG was used to finance the construction and set up of the Vietnam production facility (“DEG Vietnam Loan”). The DEG Vietnam Loan is subject to semi-annual principal payments that began November, 2017 and will end May, 2023 . Under the terms of the DEG Vietnam Loan, the Company must maintain a minimum Equity Ratio and Enhanced Equity Ratio, as defined by the DEG Vietnam Loan agreement, based on the financial statements of Gentherm’s wholly owned subsidiary, Gentherm Vietnam Co. Ltd. DEG China Loan The Company had a second DEG loan, which was used to fund capital investments in China (the “DEG China Loan”). The DEG China Loan was subject to semi-annual principal payments that began March 2015 and ended in September 2019 . During the third quarter of 2019, the DEG China Loan was paid in full. As of December 31, 2019, we were in compliance, in all material respects, with all terms as outlined in the Amended Credit Agreement and DEG Vietnam Loan. Undrawn borrowing capacity under the U.S. Revolving Note was $ 403,378 as of December 31, 2019. The following table summarizes the Company’s debt as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.

A reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets to cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash presented on the consolidated statements of cash flows is as follows: As of December 31, 2019 2018 Cash and cash equivalents presented in the consolidated balance sheets $ 50,443 $ 39,620 Restricted cash $ 2,505 $ — Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows $ 52,948 $ 39,620 Derivative Financial Instruments The Company is exposed to various market risks including, but not limited to, changes in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in interest rates and commodity price fluctuations. Market risks for changes in interest rates relate primarily to its debt obligations under the Amended Credit Agreement. Foreign currency exchange risks are attributable to sales to foreign customers and purchases from foreign suppliers not denominated in a location’s functional currency, foreign plant operations, intercompany indebtedness, intercompany investments and include exposures to the Euro, Mexican Peso, Canadian Dollar, Hungarian Forint, Macedonian Denar, Ukrainian Hryvnia, Japanese Yen, Chinese Renminbi, Korean Won and Vietnamese Dong. The Company regularly enters into derivative contracts with the objective of managing its financial and operational exposure arising from these risks by offsetting gains and losses on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the financial instruments used to hedge them. The maximum length of time over which the Company hedges its exposure to foreign currency exchange risks is one year . The Company had foreign currency derivative contracts with a notional value of $ 14,449 and $ 33,250 outstanding at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The principal currency hedged by the Company was the Mexican Peso. The Company does not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. The Company’s hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedge, and hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions both at the inception of a hedge and on an ongoing basis to be designated for hedge accounting treatment. For derivative contracts which can be classified as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets. When the underlying hedge transaction is realized, the gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive loss is recorded in earnings in the consolidated statements of income on the same line as the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. The Company records the ineffective portion of foreign currency hedging instruments, if any, to foreign currency gain (loss) in the consolidated statements of income. The Company uses an income approach to value derivative instruments, analyzing quoted market prices to calculate the forward values and then discounts such forward values to the present value using benchmark rates at commonly quoted intervals for the instrument’s full term.

Note 15 — Fair Value Measurement Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Fair value measurements are based on one or more of the following three valuation techniques: Market : This approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities. Income : This approach uses valuation techniques to convert future amounts to a single present value amount based on current market expectations. Cost : This approach is based on the amount that would be required to replace the service capacity of an asset (replacement cost). The Company uses the following fair value hierarchy to measure fair value into three broad levels, which are described below: Level 1 : Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs. Level 2 : Inputs, other than quoted market prices included in Level 1, that are observable either directly or indirectly for the asset or liability. Level 3 : Unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs. F-40 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Items Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Except for derivative financial instruments (see Note 14), pension plan assets (see Note 10) and a corporate owned life insurance policy (see Note 10), the Company has no material financial assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value at December 31, 2019 and 2018. In determining fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible and also considers counterparty credit risk in its assessment of fair value. Items Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis The Company measures certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a non-recurring basis. As these nonrecurring fair value measurements are generally determined using unobservable inputs, these fair value measurements are classified within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. As further described in “Note 4, “Acquisitions and Divestitures"", the Company utilized a third-party to assist in the Level 3 fair value estimates of $ 4,380 related to other intangible assets. The estimated fair values of these assets were based on third-party valuations and management’s estimates, generally utilizing the income approach. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no additional significant assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Items Not Carried at Fair Value The Company uses an income valuation technique to measure the fair values of its debt instruments by converting amounts of future cash flows to a single present value amount using rates based on current market expectations (Level 2 inputs). As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the carrying values of the Company’s Credit Agreement indebtedness were not materially different than their estimated fair values because the interest rates on variable rate debt approximated rates currently available to the Company (see Note 13). Discount rates used to measure the fair value of Gentherm’s DEG Vietnam Loan and DEG China Loan are based on quoted swap rates. As of December 31, 2019, the carrying value of the DEG Vietnam Loan was $ 8,750 as compared to an estimated fair value of $ 8,785 . As of December 31, 2018, the carrying values of the DEG Vietnam Loan and DEG China Loan were $ 11,250 and $ 913 , respectively, as compared to an estimated fair value of $ 11,100 and $ 900 , respectively.

F-43 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Note 18 — Accounting for Stock Based Compensation On May 16, 2013, the Compensation Committee of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”) approved the Gentherm Incorporated 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2013 Plan”), covering 3,500,000 shares of our Common Stock. On May 19, 2017, the 2013 Plan was amended, increasing the amount of available shares by 2,000,000 . The 2013 Plan permits the granting of various awards including stock options (including both nonqualified options and incentive options), stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock and restricted stock units, performance shares and certain other awards to employees, outside directors and consultants and advisors of the Company. All shares of our Common Stock that remained available for issuance under the Amended and Restated 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2006 Plan”) and the Gentherm Incorporated 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2011 Plan), were reduced to zero ; however, some options under the 2006 Plan are still outstanding. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had an aggregate of 1,308,458 shares of Common Stock available to issue under the 2013 Plan. All plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board. The selection of participants, allotment of shares, determination of price and other conditions are determined by the Compensation Committee at its sole discretion, subject to the terms of the applicable plan, in order to attract and retain personnel instrumental to the success of the Company. Stock options, for example, granted under such plans have lives for a period of up to ten years from the date of grant at an exercise price which is not less than the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of the grant. During the three-year period ended December 31, 2019, the Company has outstanding stock options, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock awards and restricted stock units to employees, directors and consultants. These awards become available to the recipient upon the satisfaction of a vesting condition, either based on a period of service or based on the performance of a specific achievement. For equity-based awards with a service condition, the requisite service period typically ranges between three to five years for employees and consultants and one year for directors. As of December 31, 2019, there were 190,080 performance-based restricted stock units (“PSUs”) outstanding. These awards vest over a three-year period after the Company’s achievement of either a target return on invested capital ratio (“ROIC”), as defined in the award agreement, for a specified fiscal year, or the Company’s common stock market price returning a target total shareholder return (“TSR”), as defined, during a specific three-year measurement period. Approximately one-half of the PSUs are earned based on the ROIC condition, while the other one-half are earned based on the TSR condition. In each case, awards will be earned at 50 % of the target number of shares for achieving a minimum threshold or up to 200 % of the target number of shares for exceeding the target, with a linear adjustment between threshold and target or between target and stretch performance goals. All other outstanding, unvested equity-based awards were service based. Equity-based award vesting may be accelerated at the discretion of the Board under conditions specified in the applicable plan. Under FASB ASC Topic 718, the provisions of the PSUs that vest upon the achievement of relative TSR are considered a market condition, and therefore the effect of that market condition is reflected in the grant date fair value for this portion award. A third party was engaged to complete a “Monte Carlo simulation” to account for the market condition. That simulation takes into account the beginning stock price of our common stock, the expected volatilities for the TSR comparator group, the expected volatilities for the Company’s stock price, correlation coefficients, the expected risk-free rate of return and the expected dividend yield of the Company and the comparator group. The single grant-date fair value computed by this valuation method is recognized by the Company in accounting for the awards regardless of the actual future outcome of the relative TSR feature. The grant date fair value of the other PSUs and RSUs are calculated as the closing price of our common stock as quoted on Nasdaq on the grant date multiplied by the number of shares subject to the award. ROIC is considered a performance condition and the grant-date fair value for ROIC PSUs corresponds with management's expectation of the probable outcome of the performance condition as of the grant date. Total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested options, restricted stock and SARs outstanding under all of the Company’s equity plans was $ 13,168 and $ 15,932 as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of two years . Compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $ 8,589 , $ 12,177 and $ 12,727 , respectively, and the related deferred tax benefit was $ 1,573 , 2,434 and $ 4,339 , respectively.

F-44 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Stock Options The following table summarizes stock option activity during the three-year period ended December 31, 2019: Options Shares Weighted-Average Exercise Price Weighted-Average Remaining Contractual Term Aggregate Intrinsic Value Outstanding at December 31, 2016 2,103,470 $ 32.72 4.86 $ 12,265 Granted 808,500 37.23 Exercised ( 202,328 ) 13.62 Forfeited ( 57,500 ) 42.54 Outstanding at December 31, 2017 2,652,142 $ 35.34 4.76 $ 6,964 Granted — — Exercised ( 615,358 ) 24.01 Forfeited ( 383,784 ) 39.59 Outstanding at December 31, 2018 1,653,000 $ 38.53 4.28 $ 3,610 Granted — — Exercised ( 428,250 ) 38.66 Forfeited ( 355,750 ) 39.99 Outstanding at December 31, 2019 869,000 $ 37.87 3.51 $ 5,172 Exercisable at December 31, 2017 984,374 $ 29.84 3.44 $ 6,534 Exercisable at December 31, 2018 788,125 $ 38.15 3.71 $ 2,200 Exercisable at December 31, 2019 665,000 $ 38.10 3.23 $ 3,725 The fair value of each option is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model in order to measure the compensation cost associated with the award. This model incorporates certain assumptions for inputs including a risk-free interest rate, expected dividend yield of the underlying Common Stock, expected option life and expected volatility in the market value of the underlying Common Stock. The following assumptions were used for options issued in the following periods: 2019 2018 2017 Expected volatility N/A N/A 33 % Weighted-average expected volatility N/A N/A 33 % Expected lives N/A N/A 3 years Risk-free interest rate N/A N/A 1.49−1.93% Expected dividend yield none none none N/A – No new stock options were granted during 2019 and 2018. F-45 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of the Company’s Common Stock. The Company uses historical exercise data and several other factors in developing an assumption for the expected lives of stock options, including the average holding period of outstanding options and their remaining terms. The risk-free interest rate is based upon quoted market yields for United States Treasury debt securities. The expected dividend yield is based upon the Company’s history of having never issued a dividend, the limitations to issue a dividend under terms of the Amended Credit Agreement and management’s current expectation regarding future dividends. We do not expect any of the options granted to be forfeited for purposes of computing fair value. The weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during the years ended December 31, 2017 was $ 9.11 . There were no stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $ 1,681 , $ 5,061 and $ 4,715 , respectively.

The Company establishes accruals for matters which it believes that losses are probable and can be reasonably estimated. Although it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of these matters, the Company is of the opinion F-48 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial position. Product liability and warranty reserves are recorded separately from legal reserves, as described below. Product Liability and Warranty Matters The Company accrues warranty obligations for products sold based on management estimates of future failure rates and current claim cost experience, with support from the sales, engineering, quality and legal functions. Using historical information available to the Company, including claims already filed by customers, the warranty accrual is adjusted quarterly to reflect management’s best estimate of future claims. The Company maintains liability insurance coverage at levels based on commercial norms and historical claims experience. The Company can provide no assurances that it will not experience material claims in the future or that it will not incur significant costs to defend such claims. The following is a reconciliation of the changes in accrued warranty costs: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 Balance at beginning of year $ 4,514 $ 5,382 Warranty claims paid ( 584 ) ( 905 ) Warranty expense for products shipped during the current period 2,370 2,678 Adjustments to warranty estimates from prior periods ( 1,660 ) ( 608 ) Acquisition of business 21 — Reclassification to liabilities held for sale — ( 1,884 ) Adjustments due to currency translation ( 65 ) ( 149 ) Balance at end of year $ 4,596 $ 4,514 Employees Approximately 25 % of the Company’s workforce are members of industrial trade unions and are employed under the terms of various labor agreements. None of these agreements expire in 2020.

General Gentherm Incorporated is a global technology and industry leader in the design, development, and manufacturing of innovative thermal management technologies. Our products provide solutions for automotive passenger comfort and convenience, battery thermal management, remote power generation, patient temperature management, and other consumer and industrial temperature control needs. Our automotive products can be found on the vehicles of nearly all major automotive manufacturers operating in North America, Europe and Asia. We operate in locations aligned with our major customers’ product strategies in order to provide locally enhanced design, integration and production capabilities and to identify future thermal technology product opportunities in both automotive and other markets. We concentrate our research on the development of new technologies and new applications from existing technologies to create product and market opportunities for a wide array of thermal management solutions. The Company has two reportable segments for financial reporting purposes: Automotive and Industrial. Automotive The Automotive reporting segment is comprised of the results from our global automotive businesses. Operating results from our climate comfort systems, specialized automotive cable systems, battery thermal management, and automotive electronic and software systems are all reported in the Automotive segment because of their complementary focus on automotive content, passenger thermal comfort and convenience. The operating results of Etratech, a business acquired in November 2017 (see “Recent Acquisition and Dispositions” below) are included within Gentherm’s Automotive segment due to the concentration of product applications within the automotive, RV and marine industries. Climate comfort system solutions include seat heaters, variable temperature Climate Control Seats (“CCS”) designed to provide individualized thermal comfort to automobile passengers, and integrated electronic components, such as blowers and electronic control units and that utilize our proprietary electronics technology and software. Other climate comfort system solutions include 3 steering wheel heaters, neck climate control systems and surface climate control system products for doors, armrests, cupholders and storage bins. Industrial The Industrial reporting segment represents the combined results from our remote power generation systems business, our patient temperature management systems business, our environmental testing equipment business and our advanced research and product development division. Our remote power generation systems business is managed by our subsidiary Gentherm Global Power Technologies (“GPT”) and our patient temperature management and environment test equipment businesses are managed by our subsidiary Cincinnati Sub-Zero (“CSZ”). The advanced research and product development division is engaged in projects to improve the efficiency and functionality of thermal management technologies and to develop, market, and distribute products based on these new technologies. The operating results from these businesses and division are presented together as one reporting segment because of their joint concentration on identifying new markets and product applications based on thermal management technologies. In June 2018, as part of a new strategic plan intended to improve business performance and position the Company to deliver above-market growth and improved profitability to its shareholders, Gentherm launched the Fit-for-Growth cost-savings initiative. One key objective for Fit-for-Growth is to eliminate non-core areas of investment within the industrial reporting segment, including elimination of our investment in GPT, Cincinnati Sub-Zero’s industrial chamber business (“CSZ-IC”), and our battery management systems division in Irvine, California. We also completed the site consolidation plan for our advanced research and development operations and vacated two leased facilities in Azusa, California. See Note 1 of the consolidated financial statements for more information about the new strategic plan and Fit-for-Growth. See Note 9 of the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the Company’s segment revenues from external customers, including geographic composition, operating income, depreciation and amortization, and goodwill. With the exception of goodwill, asset information by segment is not reported since the Company does not manage assets at the segment level. Corporate Information We are incorporated under the laws of the State of Michigan. We were originally incorporated in California in 1991 and we reincorporated in Michigan in 2005. Our internet website is www.gentherm.com. Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), are made available free of charge through our website, www.gentherm.com , as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file them with or furnish them to the Securities and Exchange Commission. These reports are also available on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s website, www.sec.gov . Business Strategy Across the globe, we produce and deliver advanced thermal solutions for automotive and patient thermal management markets that positively impact lives. To achieve our goals and capitalize on opportunities within the automotive and patient thermal management segments, we are implementing four strategies: Focus Growth The focused growth strategy includes of four key areas: • Accelerate growth in our core automotive climate and comfort businesses by leveraging human thermophysiology to offer personalized passenger comfort and improve efficiency, • Introduce an innovative microclimate solution, ClimateSense TM , that offers personalized thermal comfort in one intelligent and integrated system, • Drive battery thermal management with increased focus on active battery heating and cooling, passive battery cooling, battery heaters, and cell connecting board solutions, and • Expand patient thermal solutions that leverage synergies between our automotive climate and comfort businesses. 4 These areas of the focused growth strategy are underpinned and enabled by electronics and software systems. Extend Technology Leadership Continue to expand our technology leadership with focused investments in key core technologies and competencies, including thermophysiology, software and electronics, simulation, thermal engines and integration. Expand Gross Margin and Return on Invested Capital Strengthen operational discipline and execution to expand gross margin and return on invested capital. This strategy centers around building a culture of performance that includes a focus on high-return growth opportunities, the Fit-for-Growth cost rationalization program, and divestiture of non-core investments. Optimize Capital Allocation Optimize capital allocation to drive shareholder returns while also allowing us to reinvest in our business to drive continued growth. Make investments to grow our businesses through capital expenditure projects, focused research and development investments, and potential acquisitions that will enhance other business strategies. Recent Acquisitions and Dispositions As part of our plan to make strategic acquisitions and dispositions, we have completed the following significant acquisitions and dispositions in the recent past: On April 1, 2016, we acquired Cincinnati Sub-Zero Products, LLC to expand our temperature management activities into the medical, industrial and testing fields. In June 2018, we determined CSZ’s industrial chamber and testing business and our GPT business were not aligned with the Company’s strategic growth plan and should be eliminated. Both businesses were classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2018. On February 1, 2019, we completed the sale of CSZ’s industrial chamber and testing business and the CSZ headquarters facility to Weiss Technik North America, Inc. for total cash proceeds of $47.5 million. On November 1, 2017, we acquired Etratech Enterprises Inc. to expand our electronics capabilities, including in the automotive, consumer and commercial markets. Research and Development Our research and development activities are an essential part of our efforts to develop new, innovative products and introduce them to the market. Through both internal and external research and development programs, we are working to develop a comprehensive knowledge of thermal management systems that can demonstrate functionality and performance. These activities are critical to optimizing energy and production efficiencies, improving effectiveness in our products, and minimizing the cost to integrate our products with those of our customers. We perform advanced research and development on thermal management systems, including those that utilize new proprietary comfort software algorithms, to enhance the efficiency and functionality of our automotive heating and cooling products. We believe there are substantial opportunities to integrate innovative thermal management systems into current and future product applications. Research and development activities are expensed as incurred. These expenses include direct expenses for wages, materials and services associated with particular engineering activities, net of reimbursements from customers and research sponsors. Any related reimbursements for costs, whether for advanced research or a specific product application, are accounted for as a reduction of research and development expense. Research and development is conducted around the globe, including at our world headquarters in Northville, Michigan, our test laboratory in Farmington Hills, Michigan, our European research facilities in Odelzhausen, Germany and Budapest, Hungary, our Asian research facility in Langfang, China, our industrial application research facility in Calgary, Canada, our medical application research facility in Cincinnati, Ohio and our electronics design and advanced testing facilities in Shanghai, China and Burlington, 5 Canada. During 2018, as part of the Fit-for-Growth cost-savings initiative, Gentherm completed a sale of the advanced battery research facility in Irvine, California an d vacated advanced materials research facilities in Azusa, California. See Note 1 of the consolidated financial statement for more information about the new strategic plan, Fit-for-Growth and other restructuring activities undertaken by the Company. Additional product development is performed at all of our manufacturing facilities to support customers. We believe the localized development model employed at our global design and manufacturing facilities improves our ability to effectively serve our customers and increases our innovative capacity in the future. Net research and development expense in 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $79,900,000, $82,478,000, and $72,923,000, respectively. Because of changing levels of research and development activity, our research and development expenses fluctuate from period to period. Core Technologies Gentherm’s expertise in thermal management is focused on two general areas: managing the thermal conditions of people and objects and managing the thermal energy conversion to electrical energy. Thermoelectric Technologies Many of our thermal products manage the thermal conditions of people and objects using our internally developed advanced thermoelectric device technology (“TED”). A TED is a solid-state circuit that has the capability to produce both hot and cold thermal conditions by use of the Peltier effect. The advantages of advanced TEDs over conventional compressed gas systems are that they are environmentally friendly and less complex as they have no moving parts and are compact and light weight. For the last 18 years, our work on this technology has yielded great improvements in areas of efficiency, durability and performance. Resistive Heaters Resistive heater technologies are comprised of wire, carbon fiber or positive thermal coefficient (“PTC”) heating elements which quickly and effectively deliver heat to people and objects. Wire heating elements are designed from stainless steel, copper, our proprietary carbon fiber woven lattice technology called Carbotex® or printed circuit PTC heaters based on the specifications for a particular product application. ClimateSense TM ClimateSense is an integrated comfort system designed to create a personalized microclimate for passengers using localized convective, conductive and radiative heating and cooling products. Using self-regulating sensing technology and cloud data management, ClimateSense offers the ability to personalize and improve overall thermal comfort, improve time to comfort with (all-electric) pre-conditioning, provide comfort with less energy consumption thereby lowering carbon dioxide emissions, and extending range for electrified powertrains through a reduction in central HVAC system usage. Electronics Gentherm manufactures and supplies electronics to our core climate comfort solution products. We also supply electronics for products outside this core set and have a contract to supply value-added electronic products to third parties for adjacent areas within the automotive interior, which is scheduled to launch in 2019. Our 2017 acquisition of Canadian-based Etratech Enterprises expanded our electronics capabilities in automotive and consumer products. Automotive Cable Systems Gentherm produces automotive cable systems used to connect automotive components to sources of power. The automotive cable systems are an important element in the production of virtually all of our products and form a significant component in how we generate value to our customers by being an efficient, low-cost and high-quality manufacturer. We offer cable systems as integrated parts of our products and also as stand-alone components for other automotive applications, such as oxygen sensors. Our cable 6 systems business includes both ready-made individu al cables and ready-to-install cable networks. Sales of products that utilize our automotive cable systems technology represent ed 9 % o f our total product revenues for each of the twelve-month periods ending D ecember 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 . Air Moving Devices Our highly durable and quiet air moving devices, including our proprietary blower and fan designs, are essential to all of our products that require air movement. Production of integrated air moving devices is an example of our expanding manufacturing capabilities and is an important step toward our goal of becoming a full-service provider of sub-systems. Products Climate Comfort Solutions – Seat Comfort Climate Control Seat ® (“CCS”) Our CCS products utilize exclusive patented technology to regulate temperature and enhance the comfort of vehicle passengers. The most advanced CCS models use one or more TEDs to generate heating or cooling depending upon the direction of the current applied to the device. A TED is the heart of a compact heat pump used in our active CCS products. Air is forced through the heat pump and thermally conditioned in response to electronic switch input from the seat occupant. The conditioned air circulates by one of our specially designed air moving devices through a proprietary air distribution system installed in the seat cushion and seat back, so that the seat surface can be heated or cooled. Each seat has individual electronic controls to adjust the level of heating or cooling. Active CCS products substantially improve comfort compared with conventional air conditioners by focusing cooling directly on the passenger through the seat rather than waiting until ambient air cools the seat surface beneath the passenger. A heated and ventilated variant of the CCS utilizes ambient cabin air to provide cooling comfort instead of a TED to actively cool the seat. In the heating mode, the vent-only system is supplemented with resistive heating elements. Heated and ventilated CCS products provide a lower level of cooling capability than our active CCS solution, but at a lower price. By offering different models of the CCS product, our customers have the opportunity to purchase a wider range of climate control products at different price points. Sales of CCS products contributed 36%, 39% and 45% to our total product revenues for the twelve-month periods ending December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Heated Seat Heated seats, based on our resistive heater core technology, are seamlessly integrated into automotive seat designs, and are constructed using materials that offer the best capacity, installation characteristics and durability. Our capabilities allow customers to choose among a variety of resistive heater materials based on their individual vehicle specifications. Sales of heated seat products contributed 29%, 31% and 32% to our total product revenues for the twelve-month periods ending December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Neck Climate Control Systems Neck climate control systems ventilate warm or temperature-controlled air directly onto the passenger’s neck area. The system combines electronics, air moving device technologies and a heating element into a compact, integrated headrest design that can be adjusted to suit the body size of the passenger. Climate Comfort Solutions – Surface Climate Control Systems Heated Steering Wheel Heated steering wheels deliver heating comfort to automobile drivers through resistive elements. This product can be applied to both leather and wood steering wheels. A solution for drivers in cold and mild weather climates, the heated steering wheel is designed for the global automotive market. 7 Heated Surfaces Gentherm’s thermally conductive or radiative surfaces, such as door panel armrest and center console armrest products, are powered by our core technologies. The system is thermally managed by a heating control system which can be discretely located in the door panel or seat of the vehicle. Heated door panels and armrests complement our climate-controlled seat and steering wheel products and provide a superior level of thermal comfort to the driving experience. Battery Sub-Systems Thermoelectric Battery Thermal Management (BTM) Thermal management is critically important for the long-term operation of advanced automotive batteries. The expansion of electrified vehicle applications, such as 48-volt electrical networks, start-stop systems, regenerative braking systems and other micro-hybrid battery implementations, have drastically increased the demand for BTM systems solutions which enable wider operating temperature ranges, enhanced driving range and prolonged life of the battery. Gentherm’s BTM system can provide precision battery cooling on pack or cell-level using patented TED technology. The BTM system maintains the temperature of the lithium-ion battery or other advanced chemistry battery within an acceptable temperature range without the use of chilled liquids or refrigerant loops, making it a light weight, highly scalable, compact solution ideal for automotive applications. Gentherm’s proprietary BTM system is compact and energy efficient, resulting in a minimal energy budget, which is important for an electrified vehicle. The performance improvements realized with this product have been validated through the award of production BTM systems by two flagship original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”). We are currently working with other OEMs in an effort to secure more production contracts. Cell Connecting Systems Cell connecting systems provide secure connections between advanced automotive batteries to transmit a continuous flow of information about battery temperature and cell voltage during the charging and discharging process to monitor battery system performance. Climate Comfort Solutions – Thermal Convenience TrueTherm TM Cup Holder The TrueTherm cup holder applies Gentherm’s patented TED technologies to keep beverages of automobile drivers and passengers either warm or cool. We have developed a range of cup holder models with varying degrees of functionality, designed to be packaged in multiple configurations to accommodate different console environments. Our dual independent design provides separate temperature settings in each holder allowing the driver and passenger to individually maintain a heated or cooled beverage. TrueTherm TM Storage Unit Gentherm’s TrueTherm storage units provide for food or beverage cooling for the global automotive market. Using patented TED or refrigeration technologies, the TrueTherm cool storage unit provides temperature control independently from a vehicle’s heating and air conditioning system. It can be custom designed to accommodate tight interior spaces, such as the front floor console of a sport utility vehicle (SUV) and provide additional cooling capacity to those who have long work commutes or transport multiple passengers.

Our revenues from this product include large custom systems projects ranging from $200,000 to over $2,000,000. Quarterly results from our remote power generation business can vary significantly due to delivery timing of these custom systems to customers, among other factors. 8 Patient Temperature Management Systems Gentherm provides a full line of patient temperature management systems utilizing multiple modalities, including our Blanketrol® hyper-hypothermia system, our WarmAir® convective warming system and our FilteredFlo® warming blankets, designed to manage patient body temperatures in operating rooms, recovery rooms, intensive care units and other areas of hospitals, our as well as for use in the home healthcare market. Our systems offer simple programmable body temperature regulations to establish and maintain stable patient temperature. We also offer the industry-leading Hemotherm® blood temperature management solutions that delivers reliable, effective blood temperature management control during cardiopulmonary by-pass and other related cardiovascular procedures. Revenues from the sale of patient temperature management systems began in April 2016 in connection with the acquisition of CSZ. Environmental Testing Equipment and Testing Services Gentherm provides standard and custom designed environmental test chambers that execute reliability tests by subjecting products to environmental extremes like temperature, humidity, altitude, and vibration. Our chambers are available in a variety of sizes with capabilities ranging from basic temperature cycling to accelerated stress testing. Gentherm designs and sells environmental test chambers for a variety of industries, which include the pharmaceutical, automotive, electronics, medical, telecommunications, aerospace and defense industries. Revenues from the sale of environment testing equipment and testing services began in April 2016 in connection with the acquisition of CSZ. On February 1, 2019, we completed the sale of these divisions to Weiss Technik North America, Inc. for total cash proceeds of $47,500,000. Sponsored Research In April 2016, the Company was selected as a subcontractor in a U.S. Air Force sponsored program award for the engineering and development of a non-invasive warming and cooling device. The device will be incorporated as medical equipment in the Air Force Expeditionary Medicine Support and Air Force Theater Hospital units supporting overseas contingency operations. Once operational testing is complete and the manufacturing processes for initial production are fully matured, the device will be submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for certification. The 30-month, $5.7 million project will be fully funded by the U.S. Air Force. As a subcontractor, Gentherm’s share of the award is approximately $2.6 million. Gentherm received $750,000, $1.2 million and $300,000 in program funding during 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We expect to collect the remaining $350,000 in funding during the first quarter of 2019. Marketing, Customers and Sales Our Automotive segment customers include light vehicle OEMs, commercial vehicle OEMs, and first tier (“Tier 1”) suppliers to the automotive OEMs, including automotive seat manufacturers. We also directly supply CCS and seat heaters to aftermarket seat distributors and installers. The Company’s automotive marketing is directed primarily at automotive manufacturers and their Tier 1 suppliers and focuses on the enhanced value consumers attribute to vehicles with climate comfort products. If interested, the manufacturers direct us to work with their suppliers to integrate our products into the vehicle’s seat or interior design. These customers will sell our product, as a component of an entire seat or seating system, to automotive OEMs. Once the integration work is complete, prototypes are sent to the manufacturer for evaluation and testing. If a manufacture accepts our product, a program can then be launched for a particular model on a production basis, but it normally takes two to three years from the time a manufacturer decides to include any of our products in a vehicle model to actual volume production for that vehicle. During this process, we derive funding from prototype sales but obtain no significant revenue until mass production begins. Inherent to the automotive supplier market are costs and commitments that are incurred well in advance of the receipt of orders and resulting revenues from customers. The volume of products we sell is significantly affected by the levels of new vehicle sales and the general business conditions in the automotive industry. For 2018, our revenues from sales to our three largest customers, Lear, Adient and Bosch Automotive were $181.0 million, $166.9 million, and $79.9 million, respectively, representing 17%, 16%, and 8% of our total revenues, respectively. Revenues from Adient and Lear represent sales of our climate comfort products. Revenues from Bosch Automotive represent product sales based on 9 our automobile cable system technology and is used primarily in the production of automotive oxygen sensors. The loss of any one of these customers is likely to have a material adverse impact on our business; however, as noted above, our approach is to market climate comfort solutions, battery therma l management and cable technology products to the OEMs who then direct their suppliers, such as Adient and Lear, to work with us. It is, therefore, relevant to understand how our revenues are divided among the OEMs, as shown below. Our revenues, including those from sales of our automotive cable systems products, for each of the past three years were divided among automotive OEMs as follows: Manufacturer 2018 2017 2016 General Motors 14 % 15 % 18 % Ford Motor Company 10 11 12 Volkswagen 9 10 10 Fiat Chrysler Automobiles 9 9 10 Hyundai 7 8 10 Honda 6 6 6 Daimler 5 4 4 Renault/Nissan 5 6 6 BMW 4 5 6 Toyota Motor Corporation 3 4 4 Jaguar/Land Rover 3 3 2 Other 25 19 12 Total 100 % 100 % 100 % Non-automotive revenues of 9% in 2018, 11% in 2017 and 8% for 2016 are included within the Other category. Our power generation systems are used by oil and gas customers for cathodic pipeline protection and other remote applications around the world. Patient temperature management systems customers include hospitals and other health care service providers. Customers purchase our products at prices negotiated by exclusive medical equipment distributors or, if they are a named participant, a group purchasing organization. Our environmental testing equipment and testing services are sold to a wide variety of customer in many different industries. Our non-automotive electronics products are sold to a variety of industrial customers, including an elevator door manufacturer and an irrigation systems company. Outsourcing, Production and Suppliers Our global manufacturing facilities are located close to our key customers. Our European manufacturing operations are located at our Hungarian, Macedonian and Ukrainian sites. In North America, we operate two manufacturing production sites in Acuña, Mexico, one in Celaya, Mexico, one in Cincinnati, Ohio, one in Alberta, Canada and one in Ontario, Canada. In Asia, we operate production facilities in Langfang, China, and Ha Nam, Vietnam and two electronics production facilities in Shenzhen, China. We rely on various domestic and foreign vendors and suppliers to supply components for our products through purchase orders, with no guaranteed supply arrangements. Components for certain products, including TEDs, are only available from a limited number of suppliers in the world. The loss of any significant supplier, in the absence of a timely and satisfactory alternative arrangement, or an inability to obtain essential components on reasonable terms or at all, could materially adversely affect our business, operations and cash flows. Our business and operations could also be materially adversely affected by delays in deliveries from our suppliers. 10 Proprietary Rights and Patents The development of new technologies is critical to the execution of our business strategy. Patents obtained for new technologies form an important basis for the success of the Company and underpin the success of our research and development efforts. We have adopted a policy of obtaining, where practical, the exclusive rights to use technology related to our products through patents or licenses for proprietary technologies or processes. We adapt and commercialize such technologies in products for mass production. We also have developed technologies or furthered the development of acquired technologies through internal research and development efforts. As of December 31, 2018, Gentherm held 636 issued patents, of which 273 were U.S. patents and 363 were non-U.S. patents. A total of 17 patents were held jointly with other companies. Gentherm held 454 patents directed to climate control products and thermoelectric technologies, 139 patents directed at heating elements and technologies, 26 patents directed to air moving devices, 12 patents directed at patient temperature management systems and 5 patents directed to environmental test chambers and technologies. Competition The automotive components and systems business is highly competitive. We have several important competitors in the heated seat business and certain vehicle manufacturers have, for some time, offered options on certain models that combine heated seats with circulation of ambient air or cooled air from the car’s air conditioning system which works similar to our heated and ventilated seat system products. It is possible that our competitors will be able to expand or modify their current products to more directly compete with our CCS products. We believe that there are other potential competitors that are working to develop systems for heating and cooling of automotive car seats. We may experience additional competition directly from automobile manufacturers or other major suppliers, most of which have the capability to manufacture competing products. We believe that our products will compete successfully on the basis of performance, quality, and price. Additionally, we may experience competition from non-traditional participants that introduce new technologies, such as advanced driver assistance technologies, as well as new products or services, such as autonomous vehicles, car- and ride-sharing and transportation as a service. See “Risk Factors” for further information regarding the significant competition in the automotive industry. Our power generation systems compete with other technologies, such as photovoltaic solar panels and fuel cells, to deliver power to different types of oil and gas market applications. Our products have earned a reputation for delivering highly reliable power under extreme climatic and weather conditions to locations that do not offer access to an electrical grid. In addition to quality and performance, our ability to design and support custom solutions that integrate directly with an application’s existing infrastructure gives our products a competitive advantage over products based on other technologies. The patient temperature management market has seven segments: convective warming, blood warming, fluid warming, surface warming, invasive warming, non-invasive cooling and invasive cooling. Gentherm specializes in the convective warming, blood warming, surface warming and non-invasive cooling. We compete based on the quality of our products and service to our customers and are working to develop and market the next generation of advanced temperature management systems that complies with the rules and regulations of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other government regulatory bodies. Gentherm’s environment test chamber business compete globally on the basis of performance, customization, quality and service. Our ability to modify our standard product lines to meet customer specifications helped differentiate Gentherm’s chambers from other competitive offerings. On February 1, 2019, we completed the sale of this business. Risk Attendant to Foreign Operations We internally manufacture the majority of our products at our production facilities in foreign countries. Other products we sell are manufactured by third parties in foreign countries. See “Risk Factors” for a description of risks attendant to our foreign operations. 11 See Note 9 of the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the Company’s segment revenues by geographic composition. Seasonality Our principal operations are directly related to the automotive industry. Consequently, we have historically experienced seasonal fluctuations to the extent automotive vehicle production slows, such as in the summer months when many customer plants close for model year changeovers and in December when many customer plants close for the holidays. See Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for selected quarterly financial data.

RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider each of the risks, assumptions, uncertainties and other factors described below and elsewhere in this Report, as well as any amendments or updates reflected in subsequent filings or furnishings with the SEC. We believe these risks, assumptions, uncertainties and other factors, individually or in the aggregate, could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results and could materially and adversely affect our business operations, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. 13 Risks Relating to Our Business Numerous general economic and industry factors which we do not control have significant impacts on the automotive industry, our primary market, and resulting difficulties in the automotive industry or for our key customers and suppliers would have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition Our Automotive segment represents 91%, 89% and 92% of our product revenues for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Demand for our automotive products is directly related to automotive vehicle production, which is impacted by numerous general economic and industry factors which we do not control and is highly cyclical. In 2018, our product orders were adversely impacted by lower than expected vehicle production in North America, Europe, and Asia, and any prolonged decrease in vehicle production may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In particular, the automotive industry has been susceptible historically in the U.S. and globally to economic recessions, labor disputes, volatile fuel prices, complex and evolving regulatory requirements, trade agreements and government initiatives and uncertain availability and cost of credit. In addition to the continuation of these trends, future automotive vehicle production may be materially impacted by additional industry or consumer behaviors, including the development and use of autonomous and electric vehicles and increasing use of car- and ride-sharing and on-demand transportation as a service. We rely in part on market analysis, including from our customers and the IHS Markit reports on vehicle production, to make operational and strategic decisions, and increased market volatility makes it more difficult to obtain reliable data. Further, disruptions in the global economy and volatility in the financial markets may cause, among other things, lower levels of liquidity, increased borrowing rates, increased rates of default and bankruptcy, lower consumer and business spending, and lower consumer net worth, all of which may reduce demand for our products and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We are also limited in our ability to reduce costs to offset the results of a prolonged or severe economic downturn given certain fixed costs associated with our operations, difficulties if we overstrain our resources, and our long-term business approach that necessitates we remain in position to respond when market conditions improve. Unfavorable economic or industry conditions could result in the financial distress of our customers and suppliers. If our customers experience an actual decline or project a future decline in vehicle sales generally, or in sales of models for which we supply products, we may experience reductions in orders from these customers, experience difficulties in obtaining new business, incur write-offs of accounts receivable, incur impairment charges or require restructuring actions. In addition, if any of our significant customers experiences a material work stoppage, the customer may halt or limit the purchase of our products. This could require us to shut down or significantly reduce production at facilities relating to such products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and harm our profitability. The automotive component industry, as well as the automotive industry generally, is subject to intense competition and our current automotive products may be rendered obsolete by future technological developments The automotive component industry, from which we derive a substantial majority of our revenues, is subject to intense competition. Business is typically awarded to the supplier offering the most favorable combination of cost, quality, timely delivery, technological innovation and service. In addition, customers often demand periodic price reductions during a vehicle’s life that require us to continually assess, redefine and improve our operations, products and manufacturing capabilities to maintain and improve profitability. Many of our competitors are substantially larger in size and have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do, and therefore may be more effective in adapting to customer requirements while being profitable. We must also be responsive to the entrance of non-traditional participants in the automotive industry. These non-traditional participants may seek to disrupt the historic business model of the industry through the introduction of new technologies, such as advanced driver assistance technologies, as well as new products or services, such as autonomous vehicles, car- and ride-sharing and on-demand transportation as a service. As our business evolves, the pressure to innovate will encompass a wider range of products and services, including products and services that may be outside of our historically core business. If we do not accurately predict, prepare for and respond to new kinds of technological innovations, market developments and changing customer needs, our sales, profitability and long-term competitiveness may be harmed. In addition, t here can be no assurance that we will successfully differentiate our products from those of our competitors, that the marketplace will consider our current or proposed products to be superior or even comparable to those of our competitors, or that we can succeed in establishing new or maintaining existing relationships with automobile manufacturers. 14 Due to the rapid pace of technological change, as with any technology-based product, our ability to compete successfully will depend on our ability to develop and license improved technologies on a rapid and cost-efficient basis. For example, in the automotive industry, we believe the development of new products featuring our new ClimateSense TM technology will increase our value as an integral part of the overall vehicle climate solution. Our business will therefore require extensive capital expenditures and investment in product development, manufacturing and management informat ion systems. Further, certain of our products may be rendered obsolete by future technologies, including from competitors in our products or widespread use of autonomous vehicles, or consumer preferences. Our operations, financial results and competitive position would be materially and adversely affected if we were unable to anticipate such future developments and develop, or obtain access to, critical new technologies at a reasonable cost, or adapt to changes in the automotive industry generally. An in ability to compete successfully may also hinder our ability to complete acquisitions or financings on reasonable terms or at all. Additionally, many advanced technologies developing in the automotive industry present novel issues with which domestic and foreign regulators have only limited experience and will be subject to evolving regulatory frameworks. Any current and future regulations in these areas could impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty. Our inability to effectively manage the timing, quality and costs of new program launches could adversely affect our financial performance. The launch of a new program is a complex process, the success of which depends on a wide range of factors, including the production readiness of our and our suppliers' manufacturing facilities and manufacturing processes, as well as factors related to tooling, equipment, employees, initial product quality and other factors. Given the complexity of new program launches, we may experience difficulties managing product quality, timeliness and associated costs. In addition, new program launches require a significant ramp up of costs; however, our sales related to these new programs generally are dependent upon the timing and success of our customers’ introduction of new vehicles. Our inability to effectively manage the timing, quality and costs of these new program launches could have a materially adversely effect on our operations, financial condition and operating results. If our expansion efforts are not successfully implemented, they may adversely impact our business and results of operations Over the past few years, we have opened or acquired new manufacturing facilities in Vietnam, Macedonia, Mexico and China, to support our customers’ global operations. Opening new, or expanding existing, manufacturing facilities entail a number of risks, including our ability to successfully manage the demands placed on our management resources and engineering and quality teams, our ability to continue production at levels, quality and within the cost and timeframe estimated, the continuing implementation of internal controls and compliance, varied local regulations, and our ability to attract and maintain a sufficient number of skilled workers at the requisite locations to meet the needs of the facilities. Our results of operations could also be adversely impacted by start-up costs until production levels at the facilities reach planned levels, as well as any legacy issues with acquired or existing facilities. These newly developed or acquired facilities, as well as our other production facilities around the world, could have significant unused capacity if our product revenues do not continue to increase. Significant unused capacity would result in overhead costs that would need to be absorbed by a smaller than expected revenue base, which could materially and adversely impact our financial results. While there are currently no active projects to construct new manufacturing facilities, or agreements to acquire other manufacturing facilities, or plans to materially expand existing facilities, we regularly consider such opportunities and any future construction or acquisition activities, particularly in foreign countries, could entail the risks noted above. If we experience construction or regulatory delays or increased costs, our estimates and assumptions are incorrect, or other unforeseen events occur, our business, financial conditions and results of operations could be adversely impacted. Our ability to market our automotive products is subject to a lengthy sales and acceptance cycle, which requires significant investment prior to significant sales revenue, and non-automotive products may be subject to similar time lags The sales cycle for our automotive products is lengthy because an automobile manufacturer must develop a high degree of assurance that the products it buys will meet consumer needs, interface as easily as possible with the other parts of a vehicle and with the automobile manufacturer’s production and assembly process, and have minimal warranty, safety and service problems. As a result, 15 from the time that a manufacturer develops a stro ng interest in our products for a specified vehicle, it normally will take several years before our products are available to consumers in that vehicle. In the automotive components industry, products typically proceed through five stages of research and development. Initial research on the product concept comes first, to assess its technical feasibility and economic costs and benefits. This stage often includes development of an internal prototype for the component supplier’s own evaluation. If the product appears feasible, the component supplier manufactures a functioning prototype to demonstrate and test the product’s features. These prototypes are then marketed and sold to automotive companies for testing and evaluation. If an automobile manufacturer shows interest in the product, it typically works with the component supplier to refine the product, then purchases second and subsequent generation engineering prototypes for further evaluation. Finally, the automobile manufacturer either decides to purchase the component for a production vehicle or terminates the program. The time required to progress through these five stages to commercialization varies widely. Generally, the more a component must be integrated with other vehicle systems, the longer the process takes. Further, products that are installed by the factory usually require extra time for evaluation because other vehicle systems are affected, and a decision to introduce the product into the vehicle is not easily reversed. Because our automotive products affect other vehicle systems and are factory-installed items, the process usually takes several years from conception to commercialization. While we currently have active development programs with various seat manufacturers and automotive OEMs for our thermal management products, no assurance can be given that our products will be implemented in any particular vehicles. During this development process, we derive minimal funding from prototype sales but generally obtain no significant revenue until mass production begins, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. If our products are not selected after a lengthy development process, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. Non-automotive products that we develop or significantly update are also likely to have a lengthy sales cycle. Because the use of our proprietary technology in other markets is new and evolving, and because customers will likely require any new product or significantly changed product that we develop to pass certain feasibility, safety and economic viability tests before committing to purchase, it is expected that any new or significantly changed products we develop in non-automotive markets also will take several years before they are sold to customers, if at all. Our ability to market our products successfully depends on acceptance of our products by existing and potential customers and consumers, as well as the success of our customers We have been, and will continue to be, required to educate potential customers and demonstrate that the merits of our existing products justify the costs associated with them. Similar efforts will be required with potential customers for additional products we develop using technologies we develop or license. Manufacturers will only include our products if there appears to be demand for our products from the consumers. For our automotive products, we rely on OEMs and applicable dealer networks to market our products to consumers, and we do not have any control over the marketing budget or messaging nor the training of employees and agents regarding our products. Further, OEMs and dealer networks may market products offered by our competitors, including products manufactured by such OEMs. If customers or consumers conclude that temperature control seats or our other automotive products are unnecessary or too expensive or that our competitors offer more favorable terms or better products, OEMs and other manufacturers may reduce availability or decline to include our products in their vehicles. In addition, the vehicle market is highly competitive among OEMs, which drives continual cost-cutting initiatives by our customers. It is possible that pricing pressures beyond our expectations could intensify as OEMs pursue restructuring and cost cutting initiatives. If we are unable to generate sufficient production cost savings in the future to offset such price reductions, our gross margin, rate of profitability and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected. We must also satisfy the timing, performance and quality standards of our customers and consumers during mass production. Further, we are dependent upon the timing and success of our customers’ continuation of existing vehicles and introduction of new vehicles which include our products. If such vehicles are not successful in the marketplace, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. 16 Significant increases in the ma rket prices and restrictions on the availability of certain raw materials may materially and adversely affect our business Many of our products include TEDs which contain certain raw materials that generally cannot be substituted. The prices for these raw materials fluctuate depending on market conditions. We generally have no contractual price protections with our suppliers and customers regarding raw material costs. Substantial increases in the prices for our raw materials increase our operating costs and could reduce our profitability if we cannot recover these increases from our customers. As an example, Tellurium is a raw material used in TEDs. If the market price for this raw material significantly increases, as it has in the past, our gross profit may be adversely impacted as our suppliers pass those price increases on to us. Other key raw materials include copper, silver and petroleum based engineered plastics. In addition, the availability of raw materials fluctuates from time to time due to factors outside our control, including as a result of catastrophic events, which may adversely impact our ability to meet customer commitments or needs. Our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by shortages or significant price increases of key raw materials. The disruption or loss of relationships with vendors and suppliers for the components for our products could materially and adversely affect our business Our ability to manufacture and market our products successfully is dependent on relationships with both third party vendors and suppliers. We rely on various vendors and suppliers for the components of our products and procure these components through purchase orders, with no guaranteed supply arrangements. Certain components are only available from a limited number of suppliers. The loss of any significant supplier, in the absence of a timely and satisfactory alternative arrangement, or an inability to obtain essential components on reasonable terms or at all, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Our business also could be materially and adversely affected by delays in deliveries from suppliers because we carry minimal inventory of product components. Automobile manufacturers, in particular, demand on-time delivery of quality products, and some have required the payment of substantial financial penalties for failure to deliver components to their plants on a timely basis. Such penalties, as well as costs to avoid them, such as overtime costs and overnight air freighting of parts that normally are shipped by other less expensive means of transportation due to our global production operations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, the inability to meet demand for our products on a timely basis would materially and adversely affect our reputation and future commercial prospects. In addition, financial difficulties or solvency problems with our suppliers, which may be exacerbated by the cost of remediating quality issues with these items, could lead to uncertainty in our supply chain or cause supply disruptions for us which could, in turn, disrupt our operations, including production. Further, we engage outside contractors to perform product assembly and other production functions for certain of our products. Our reliance upon third party contractors for certain production functions reduces our control over the manufacture of our products and makes us dependent in part upon such third parties to deliver our products in a timely manner, with satisfactory quality controls and on a competitive basis. If we are unable to meet commitments to our customers due to third party services in production, our business, results of operations, financial condition and reputation could be materially and adversely affected. Our business is subject to risks associated with manufacturing processes We internally manufacture a large and growing portion of our products at our fourteen production facilities. See Item 2. below for information regarding our significant properties. Other products we sell are manufactured by third parties. A catastrophic loss of the use of all or a portion of our facilities due to accident, fire, explosion, labor issues, civil unrest, weather conditions, other natural disaster or otherwise, whether short or long-term, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. This risk is exacerbated by the fact that our primary manufacturing locations are in Mexico, China, Vietnam, Macedonia and Ukraine, all countries that have historically experienced a heightened degree of political, civil and labor uncertainty. Political conflict and related demonstrations and violence in Ukraine in recent years, for example, highlights the risks to our foreign manufacturing facilities. Although our manufacturing facility in Ukraine is located approximately 700 miles by road from Kiev, and approximately the same distance from the activities along the border of Ukraine and Russia where fighting has occurred, we 17 cannot be certain that similar demonstrations, unrest and international tensions will not affect our facility in the future, i ncluding due to electrical outages and periodic battles with separatists closer to our facility. In addition, certain of our employees in Ukraine are routinely conscripted into the military and/or sent to the Russian border to fight in the ongoing conflict . Furthermore, most of our products manufactured in Ukraine are shipped across the border from Ukraine to Hungary for further delivery to our customers. If that border crossing were to be closed or restricted for any reason, we would essentially experienc e a loss of the use of our Ukrainian facility, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. Unexpected failures of our equipment and machinery also may result in production delays, revenue loss and significant repair costs, injuries to our employees, and customer claims. Any interruption in production capability may require us to delay fulfilling orders, utilize less efficient internal facilities on a temporary basis and make large capital expenditures to remedy the situation, which could have a negative impact on our profitability and cash flows. We maintain property damage insurance that we believe to be adequate to provide for reconstruction of facilities and equipment, as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from any production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss. However, any recovery under our insurance policies may not be offset the lost sales or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations, and such proceeds may be received and accounted for in a different reporting period, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow generally or for a specific reporting period. Our global operations subject us to risks that may harm our operations and financial results In 2018, 53% of our product revenue was generated from sales to customers outside the United States. We have significant personnel, property, equipment and operations in a number of countries outside of the United States, including Canada, China, Germany, Hungary, Macedonia, Mexico, Ukraine and Vietnam. We have also engaged third parties to produce products for us in China and Japan. We and these third parties maintain production facilities in lower-cost countries for cost containment reasons. Our exposure to the risks described below is substantial and increasing. We also derive a significant portion of revenues from Europe and Asia and conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies. In addition to the general risks relating to our operations, our international operations are subject to unique risks inherent in doing business abroad, including: • exposure to local economic conditions and infrastructure; • different and complex local laws and regulations and enforcement thereof, including those relating to governance, taxes, litigation, anti-corruption, employment, employee benefits, environmental, competition, permitting, investment, product regulations, repatriation, and export/import restrictions or requirements, such as the recently implemented revised emissions test procedure in Europe referred to as the Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicles Test Procedure that has limited the production of certain vehicles as OEMs have struggled to meet the new requirements ; • increased uncertainty regarding social, political, immigration and trade policies in the U.S. and abroad, such as recent U.S. legislation and policies regarding NAFTA and tariffs and the U.K.’s pending Brexit (as defined below); • political, economic and civil instability (including acts of terrorism, civil unrest, drug-cartel related and other forms of violence and outbreaks of war); • expropriation, nationalization or other protectionist activities; • currency exchange rate fluctuations and currency controls; in particular, a significant portion of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar, including the Euro, the Chinese Renminbi, the Vietnamese Dong, the Hungarian Forint, the Macedonian Denar, the Ukrainian Hryvnia, and the Mexican Peso; • increases in working capital requirements and greater potential for production and delivery delays due to extended logistics and geo-political developments; • local business and cultural factors that differ from our customary standards and practices, including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in due to anti-corruption laws and regulations; and 18 • global sovereign fiscal matters and creditworthiness, including potential defaults an d the related impacts on economic activity, including the possible effects on credit markets, currency values, monetary unions, international treaties and fiscal policies. See “Our business is subject to risks associated with manufacturing processes” above for a description of certain specific risks associated with our facility in Ukraine. Modification of the North American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”) or other international trade agreements, and the imposition of significant tariffs on imports into the United States, could have a material and adverse effect on our business A significant portion of our business activities are conducted in foreign countries, including Mexico. As a result of changes to U.S. administrative policy, there may be changes to existing trade agreements, like NAFTA and its anticipated successor agreement, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (“USMCA”) which is still subject to approval by the U.S., Mexico and Canada, greater restrictions on free trade generally, and significant increases in tariffs on goods imported into the U.S., particularly tariffs on products manufactured in Mexico, among other possible changes. Additionally, during 2018, the U.S. and China applied significant tariffs to certain of each other’s exports. The institution of trade tariffs, both globally and between the U.S. and China specifically, carries the risk of negatively impacting overall economic conditions, which could have negative repercussions on the Company. More directly, imposition of tariffs has caused and could cause further increases in the costs of our raw materials which we may not be able to pass on to our customers in part or in full, which would directly and negatively impact our business. We purchase a significant amount of raw material components, including products manufactured in our China facilities, which are subject to the recently-enacted tariffs. The imposition of tariffs has caused and could cause further increases in the costs of our raw materials, and we may not be able to mitigate the impact from these tariffs or additional future tariffs. It remains unclear what the U.S. administration or foreign governments, including Mexico and China, will or will not do with respect to tariffs, NAFTA, USMCA or other international trade agreements and policies. A trade war, other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements, changes in U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories and countries where we currently manufacture and sells products, and any resulting negative sentiments towards the U.S. as a result of such changes, likely would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Political and economic uncertainty arising from the outcome of the referendum on the membership of the United Kingdom in the European Union could adversely impact our financial results In June 2016, the United Kingdom (U.K.) voted to exit the European Union (“Brexit”) in a referendum vote. In March, 2017, the U.K. formally notified the European Union of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty, which provides a two-year time period through March 2019 for the U.K. and the European Union countries to negotiate a withdrawal. The announcement of Brexit and the ongoing negotiations for the withdrawal of the U.K. from the European Union has created and may continue to create global economic uncertainty, which may continue to impact global light vehicle production, and affect the business of and/or our relationships with our customers and suppliers, as well as alter the relationship among tariffs and currencies. The long-term effects of Brexit remain uncertain, and Brexit has and may continue to contribute to volatility in stock prices of companies that have significant operations in Europe, and on currency exchange rates. Significant currency fluctuations may negatively impact our operations; we generate certain revenues in Euro, but do not generate revenues denominated in the British Pound. In addition, Brexit could result in legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as new legal relationships between the United Kingdom and the European Union are established. The ultimate effects of Brexit on us also will depend on the terms of any agreements the U.K. and the European Union make to retain access to each other's respective markets either during a transitional period or more permanently. Significant price volatility, or uncertainty in future pricing, or oil and natural gas may materially and adversely impact our Gentherm Global Power Technologies (GPT) business A large portion of our GPT products are sold to companies in the oil and gas industry, in particular, pertaining to new oil and gas pipelines and wells. Prices for oil and natural gas historically have been volatile and are expected to continue to be volatile. 19 Signific ant changes in the price of oil and natural gas or uncertainty as to future pricing can adversely impact the number of new oil explorations and installations, and cause the postponement or cancellation of existing projects, any of which would ad versely aff ect our GPT business, and adversely impact our ability to sell the business on favorable terms or at all. Tax matters, including the changes in corporate tax rates, disagreement with taxing authorities and imposition of new taxes could impact our results of operations and financial condition. We are subject to income and other taxes in the U.S. and our operations, plans and results are affected by tax and other initiatives. On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (H.R. 1) (the “Tax Act”) was signed into law by President Trump. The Tax Act contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of earnings (except for certain small business), limitation of the deduction for net operation losses (“NOLs”) to 80% of current year taxable income and elimination of NOL carrybacks, one time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, elimination of U.S. tax on foreign earnings (subject to certain important exceptions), new taxes on certain foreign earnings, a new minimum tax related to payment to foreign subsidiaries and affiliates, immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits. It is uncertain if, and to what extent, various states will conform to the new tax law and foreign countries will react by adopting tax legislation or taking other actions. We are also subject to regular reviews, examinations, and audits by the Internal Revenue Service and other taxing authorities with respect to our taxes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions we have taken, we could face additional tax liability, including interest and penalties. There can be no assurance that payment of such additional amounts upon final adjudication of any disputes will not have a material impact on our result of operations and financial position. We also need to comply with new, evolving or revised tax laws and regulations. The enactment of or increases in tariffs, or other changes in the application or interpretation of the Tax Act, or on specific products that we sell or with which our products compete, may have an adverse effect on our business or on our results of operations. Our patient temperature management systems business is subject to extensive industry regulation and failure to comply with all applicable rules and regulation may adversely impact us Our patient temperature management products are subject to extensive, complex, costly and evolving government regulation. In the United States, this is principally administered by the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). Various regulatory agencies in foreign countries where our medical products are sold also regulate that business. Under these regulations, we are subject to periodic inspection of our facilities, procedures and operations and testing of our products. Following such inspections, we may receive observations, notices, citations and/or warning letters that could require us to modify certain activities identified during the inspection, possibly at a significant cost. We are also required to report adverse events associated with our medical products to the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Unexpected or serious health or safety concerns could result in liability claims, recalls, market withdrawals or other regulatory actions. The process for obtaining governmental approval to manufacture and market new medical devices is time-consuming and costly. We are dependent on receiving FDA and other governmental or third-party approvals prior to manufacturing, marketing and shipping any new medical products. We cannot be certain that any new medical products we develop will receive FDA or other necessary approvals. Any failure to comply with anti-corruption laws and regulations could have a material and adverse effect on our reputation, business and financial results Our operations outside of the United States require us to comply with various anti-bribery and anti-corruption regulations, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act and the China Anti-Unfair Competition Law. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in anti-bribery law enforcement activity, with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both U.S. and non-U.S. regulators, and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals. We operate in many parts of the world that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption and local customs and practices that can be inconsistent with anti-bribery laws. We have internal control 20 policies and procedures, and we have implemented training and compliance programs for our employees and agents, with respect to these regulations. However, our policies, procedures and programs may not always protect us from negligent, reckless or criminal acts commi tted by our employees or agents. We could incur significant expenses in investigating any potential violation and could incur severe criminal or civil sanctions and/or fines as a result of violations or settlements regarding such laws. In addition, any a llegations, settlements or violations could materially and adversely impact our reputation and our relationships with current and future customers, suppliers, employees and agents. Also, some of our competitors may not be subject to, or similarly comply w ith, the same anti-corruption laws, which could provide them a competitive advantage. We are subject to significant currency risk related to our global operations A significant portion of our global transactions is conducted in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. While we sometimes employ financial instruments to hedge some of our transactional foreign exchange exposure, developing an effective and economical foreign currency risk strategy is complex and expensive and no strategy can completely insulate us from those exposures. Hedging arrangements also may expose us to additional risks, including that a counterparty may fail to honor its obligations, and additional costs, including transaction fees and breakage costs. Changes in the exchange rates of foreign currencies could significantly affect our reported results of operations and financial condition. In addition, concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain European countries that have adopted the Euro currency (the ""Euro Zone"") and their ability to meet future financial obligations, as well as concerns regarding the overall stability of the Euro to function as a single currency among the diverse economic, social and political circumstances within the Euro Zone. For example, the announcement of the United Kingdom’s decision to exit the European Union continues to cause significant volatility in currency exchange rates, especially between the U.S. dollar and British pound sterling. If one of the Euro Zone countries were to default on its debt or other Euro Zone countries withdraw from the Euro currency, the impact on global markets, and on our business, results of operations and financial condition, could be significant, and that impact would intensify substantially if the Euro currency were dissolved entirely. Such a development could also cause financial and capital markets across the globe to constrict, reducing liquidity and increasing borrowing costs, and could have a significant negative impact on consumer confidence and spending. Any failure to protect our intellectual property developed or licensed could harm our business and competitive position We believe that patents and proprietary rights have been and will continue to be very important in enabling us to compete. If our patents are circumvented, rendered invalid or unenforceable, or narrowed in scope, the patent coverage afforded to our products would be impaired, which could significantly impede our ability to market our products, negatively affect our competitive position and materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations. There can be no assurance that any new or pending patents will be issued, that our or our licensors’ proprietary rights will not be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable, or that our patents will provide us with meaningful competitive advantages. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar products or will not design around any patents that have been or may be issued to our licensors or us. Also, failure to seek or obtain patents in certain foreign countries may materially and adversely affect our ability to compete effectively in those international markets. Further, as we expand our operations in jurisdictions where the protection of intellectual property rights is less robust, such as China, the risk of others duplicating our proprietary technologies increases, despite efforts we undertake to protect them. Foreign governments may adopt regulations—and foreign governments or courts may render decisions—requiring compulsory licensing of intellectual property rights, or foreign governments may require products to meet standards that serve to favor local companies. Because of rapid technological developments in the automotive industry and the competitive nature of the market, the patent position of any component manufacturer is subject to uncertainties and may involve complex legal and factual issues. Consequently, although we either own or have licenses to certain patents, and are currently processing a significant number of additional patent applications, it is possible that no patents will issue from any pending applications or that claims allowed in any existing or future patents issued or licensed to us will be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, or that any rights granted under such patents will not provide us adequate protection. There is an additional risk that we may be required to participate in interference proceedings to determine the priority of inventions or may be required to commence litigation to protect our rights, which could result in substantial costs and divert the attention of management and technical and engineering personnel. 21 In addition to patents, we rely on a combination of trademarks, copy rights, know-how, confidentiality provisions and licensing agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We cannot guarantee, however, that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent infringement of our rights or misappropriat ion thereof. To the extent that consultants, key employees or other third parties apply technological information independently developed by them or by others to our proposed projects, disputes may arise as to the proprietary rights to such information that may not be resolved in our favor. Additionally, with respect to licensed technology, there can be no assurance that the licensor of the technology will have the resources, financial or otherwise, or desire to defend against any challenges to the rights of such licensor to its patents. Our products may conflict with patents that have been or may be granted to competitors or others Other persons could bring legal actions against us claiming damages and seeking to enjoin manufacturing and marketing of our products for allegedly conflicting with patents held by them. Any such litigation could result in substantial cost to us, divert the attention of management and engineering and technical personnel, and harm our reputation. If any such actions are successful, in addition to any potential liability for damages, we could be required to cease selling or using infringing products, obtain a license in order to continue to manufacture or market the affected products, or redesign the infringing products. There can be no assurance that we would prevail in any such action, that any license required under any such patent would be made available on acceptable terms, if at all, or that we could redesign such products on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost, if at all. Failure to obtain needed patents, licenses or proprietary information held by others may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. From time to time, we receive notices from third parties suggesting that our products infringe on the proprietary rights of others and historically we have had litigation regarding such matters. While we do not believe that any current claim of patent infringement is valid and material, we must spend time and resources reviewing, defending and resolving such claims. We rely on trade secret protection through confidentiality agreements and the agreements could be breached or information may be otherwise stolen We rely on trade secrets that we seek to protect, in part, through confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with employees, customers and other parties. There can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any such breach or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by competitors. The theft or unauthorized use or publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information could harm our competitive position and reduce acceptance of our products, as well as the value of our investment in research and development, product development and marketing. In addition, third parties might make claims against us related to losses of confidential or proprietary information, end-user data or system reliability. These incidents and claims could severely disrupt our business, and we could suffer losses, including the cost of product recalls and returns and reputational harm. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future. Our most significant customers typically reserve the right unilaterally to cancel contracts or reduce prices, and the exercise of such right could reduce or eliminate any financial benefit to us anticipated from such contract Due to their purchasing size, automotive customers typically reserve the right unilaterally to cancel contracts completely or to require price reductions during the term of the contract. Although these customers generally agree as a commercial practice to reimburse companies for actual out-of-pocket costs incurred with respect to the particular contract up to the point of cancellation, these reimbursements typically do not cover costs associated with acquiring general purpose assets, such as facilities and capital equipment, or for increases in employee count and related costs, and may be subject to negotiation and substantial delays in receiving payment on such actual out-of-pocket costs. Any unilateral cancellation of, or price reduction with respect to, any contract could reduce or eliminate any financial benefits anticipated from such contract. If we are not able to offset pricing reductions through improved operating efficiencies and reduced expenditures, such price reduction could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 22 The third parties that have agreed to reimburse portions of our research and development expenses generally also reserve the right to un ilaterally terminate those contracts. There can be no assurance that we will continue to receive the third party reimbursements for any of our research and development efforts. A significant product liability lawsuit, warranty claim or product recall involving us or one of our major customers, or an investigation regarding vehicle safety generally, could materially and adversely affect our financial performance In the event that our products fail to perform as expected, whether allegedly due to our fault or that of one of our suppliers, and such failure results in, or is alleged to result in, bodily injury and/or property damage or other losses, we may be subject to product liability lawsuits and other claims or we may be required or requested by our customers or regulators to participate in a recall or other corrective action involving such products. We also are a party to agreements with certain of our customers, whereby these customers may pursue claims against us for contribution of all or a portion of the amounts sought in connection with product liability and warranty claims. We carry insurance for certain product liability claims, but such coverage may be limited. In addition, we may not be successful in recovering amounts from third parties, including suppliers, in connection with these claims. These types of claims could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Over the past couple of years, there has been a significant increase in the level of scrutiny given to vehicle safety issues. Inquiries are being conducted not only by traditional regulators but also by state Attorneys General. Furthermore, the U.S. Department of Justice has commenced investigations and U.S. Congressional hearings have also been conducted in which vehicle manufacturers and in some cases suppliers are being called to testify as to particular safety risks. This increased scrutiny could materially and adversely affect the business of our customers and suppliers and subject us to fines, penalties, sanctions and/or investigations. We are involved from time to time in various legal and regulatory proceedings and claims, which could adversely affect our financial performance We are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings and claims that, from time to time, are significant. These are typically claims that arise in the normal course of business including, without limitation, commercial or contractual disputes, including disputes with our customers, suppliers or competitors, intellectual property matters, personal injury claims, environmental matters, tax matters, employment matters and antitrust matters. No assurances can be given that such proceedings and claims will not adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Our success will depend in large part on retaining key personnel and effective succession planning Our success will depend to a large extent upon the continued contributions of key personnel. The loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business. Effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. Further, our success will depend, in part, upon our ability to retain qualified engineering and other technical and marketing personnel. There is significant competition for technologically qualified personnel in our business and we may not be successful in recruiting or retaining sufficient qualified personnel. We are required to comply with environmental laws and regulations that could cause us to incur significant costs Our manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous laws and regulations designed to protect the environment inside and outside the United States, and we expect that additional requirements with respect to environmental matters will be imposed on us in the future. We may also assume, or be deemed to assume, significant environmental liabilities in acquisitions. Environmental liability may be imposed without regard to fault, and under certain circumstances, can be joint and several, resulting in one party being held responsible for the entire obligation. Material future expenditures may be necessary if compliance standards change or material unknown conditions that require remediation are discovered. No assurance can be given that all environmental liabilities have been identified or that no prior owner or operator of our properties or former properties has created an environmental condition not known to us. Environmental laws could also restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses in connection with our business. Violations of these requirements could result in fines or sanctions, obligations to investigate or remediate contamination, third party property damage or personal injury claims due to the migration of contaminants off-site, or modification or revocation of our operating permits, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. 23 We may be unable to realize th e expected benefits of our restructuring actions, which could adversely affect our profitability and operations In 2018, we announced significant restructuring and cost reduction actions to lower our operating costs in response to difficult market and operating conditions in various parts of the world. These actions included workforce reductions, asset impairment, plant closures, and minimization or elimination of investments in non-core areas. As we continue to assess our performance throughout various regions, we may take additional restructuring actions to rationalize our operations, which may result in impairments and reduce our profitability in the periods incurred. In addition, we may not realize anticipated savings or benefits from past or future cost reduction actions in full or in part or within the time periods we expect. We are also subject to the risks of labor unrest, negative publicity and business disruption in connection with our cost reduction actions. Failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from our cost reduction actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and cash flows. We may not realize significant benefits from acquisitions or joint ventures because of integration difficulties and other challenges We regularly consider acquisitions to expand the breadth of products derived from core thermal technologies as well as the markets in which they are applied. Identifying suitable potential acquisitions, conducting due diligence, successfully negotiating and closing an acquisition and the acquisition integration process are complex, costly and time-consuming. The difficulties of completing and integrating an acquisition include, among others: • incurring additional debt and/or issuing additional securities, increasing leverage risks or dilution; • unsatisfactory returns on our investments and our inability to realize the expected benefits of such acquisitions or joint ventures; • difficulties in implementing our business plan for the combined business, including achieving anticipated synergies in amount and on time; • required significant capital expenditures to integrate our operations and pursue synergies; • unanticipated issues in integrating manufacturing, logistics, financial and other internal controls, communications and other systems; • diversion of management attention and capital from ongoing business concerns to integration matters; • challenges assimilating management and other personnel, including because of differences in culture, language and background for international acquisitions; • difficulty maintaining oversight over internal controls and preventing misconduct or other violations of applicable laws by any investment which we do not exercise control; • the size of operations acquired relative to our existing business; • unanticipated changes in applicable laws and regulations; • failure to obtain regulatory or other approvals; • failure to retain key employees, customers and suppliers of the combined business; • assumption of known and unknown liabilities, some of which may be difficult or impossible to quantify; and • non-cash impairment charges or other accounting charges relating to the acquired assets. To the extent we complete an acquisition in a new industry, the above risks will be heightened due to our lack of familiarity with such business. 24 In the future, we may not be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition or joint venture opportunities or complete any particular acquisition, combin ation, joint venture or other transaction on acceptable terms. Our identification of suitable acquisition candidates and joint venture opportunities and the integration of acquired business operations involve risks inherent in assessing the values, strengt hs, weaknesses, risks and profitability of these opportunities, as well as significant competition for such acquisition opportunities. Our focus on acquisition opportunities may require significant financial, management and related resources that would oth erwise be used for the ongoing development of our existing operations and internal expansion. We may not generate enough liquid assets to fund our ongoing operations and investments and service our debt Based on our current business plan, we believe our cash on hand along with cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to meet operating and capital expenditure needs and to service our debt for the foreseeable future. However, if cash flows from operations decline, we may need to obtain alternative sources of capital and reduce or delay capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments, all of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy and materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we may need to complete one or more equity or debt financings if we consummate any significant acquisitions. There can be no assurance that such capital will be available at all or on reasonable terms, which could materially and adversely affect our future operations and business strategy. 25 We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows to meet our substantial debt service obligations, and such substantial debt service obligations could materially and adversely affect our business, resul ts of operations and financial condition Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt obligations depends on our ability to generate cash flows from operations in the future. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business. Additionally, we may not be able to affect such actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Our debt obligations could have important consequences to our business, results of operations and financial condition. For example: • we may be more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions; • we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of cash flows for other purposes, including for working capital, dividends, capital expenditures, business development efforts and to finance mergers and acquisitions; • our ability to borrow additional debt for operations, working capital or to finance future mergers and acquisitions may be limited; • our ability to refinance or repay other debt obligations when they become due may be limited; • we are exposed to the risk of increased interest rates because a portion of our borrowings, including under our credit facilities, are at variable rates of interest; and • our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate may be limited, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness. Our debt agreements contain certain restrictive covenants and customary events of default. These restrictive covenants limit our ability to take certain actions, such as, among other things: incur additional debt, make certain payments or distributions, engage in mergers or consolidations, make certain dispositions and transfers of assets, enter into transactions with affiliates and guarantee indebtedness. While not unusual for financings of the type that we have, the restrictions in our credit facilities may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business and may make it difficult for us to execute our business plans, take advantage of business opportunities, or react to changing industry conditions. Upon an event of default, if not waived by our lenders, our lenders may declare all amounts outstanding as due and payable, which may cause cross-defaults under our other debt obligations. If our lenders accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness, we may not have sufficient capital available at that time to pay the amounts due to all lenders on a timely basis, and there is no guarantee that we would be able to repay, refinance, or restructure the payments on such debt. Further, under our credit facilities, the lenders would have the right to foreclose on certain of our assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. 26 Our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely impacted from a decrease in or cessation or clawback of government incentives related to investments We receive economic benefits from national, state, and local governments in various regions of the world in the form of incentives designed to encourage manufacturers to establish, maintain, or increase investment, workforce, or production. These incentives may take various forms, including grants, loan subsidies, and tax abatements or credits. The impact of these incentives can be significant in a particular market during a reporting period. A decrease in, expiration without renewal of, or other cessation or clawback of government incentives for any of our business units, as a result of administrative decision or otherwise, could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition, as well as our ability to fund new investments. Security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology networks and systems, including a disruption related to cybersecurity, could interfere with our operations and could compromise the confidentiality of our proprietary information We rely upon information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed or hosted by third-parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities, including electronic communications among our locations around the world and between Company personnel and our customers and suppliers, supply chain management, manufacturing, and invoicing and collection of payments. We use these information technology network and systems to process financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting and legal and tax requirements. Additionally, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, the proprietary business information of our customers and suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of our employees, customers and suppliers, in data centers, on information technology networks and systems, some of which are operated by third parties and third party locations. The secure operation of these data centers, information technology networks, and systems and the processing, maintenance, confidentiality, integrity and availability of this information, is critical to our business operations and strategy. The Company maintains an information risk management program which is supervised by information technology management and reviewed by a cross-functional committee. As part of this program, reports that include analysis of emerging risks as well as the Company’s plans and strategies to address them are regularly prepared and presented to senior management and the Board of Directors. Despite security measures, such as disaster recovery and business continuity plans, including those measures related to cybersecurity, these data centers, our information technology networks and systems may be vulnerable to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by hackers or breaches due to errors or malfeasance by employees, contractors and others who have access to our networks and systems, or other disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware, power outages, computer viruses, telecommunication or utility failures, geopolitical events, or natural disasters or other catastrophic events. Cyber threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. The occurrence of any of the aforementioned events, many of which are outside our control, could compromise our systems or networks and the information stored there, which may include confidential or proprietary information or personal information of third parties, could be accessed, publicly disclosed, compromised, corrupted, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss or corruption of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability or regulatory penalties under laws protecting the privacy of personal information, disrupt operations, cause a loss of confidence in our reputation, goodwill, products and services, reduce the competitive advantage we expect to derive from our investment in advanced technologies and adversely affect our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows. We maintain cyber risk insurance, but this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses from any future breaches of our systems. We may face particular privacy, data security and data protection risks due to the new European General Data Protection Regulation Legislators and/or regulators in countries in which we operate are increasingly adopting or revising privacy, information security and data protection laws. In particular, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective on May 25, 2018, imposes additional obligations and risk upon our business and which increases substantially the penalties to which we could be subject in the event of any non-compliance. The GDPR requires companies to satisfy new requirements regarding the handling of personal data, including its use, protection and the rights of affected persons regarding their data. Failure to comply with GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue. The GDPR and other similar laws and regulations, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions, may be costly to comply with, result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, and subject us to remedies that may harm our business, including finds or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices. The Company has 27 taken measures to ensure compliance with the GDPR. Due to the lack of experience with the interpretation of this new regulation and its enforcement of our current measures might not satisfy the best practices that will be established in the coming years. As personal data is processed using information technology, the risks disclosed with re spect to “Security breaches and other disruptions” apply accordingly. Risks Related to Our Common Stock We have anti-takeover defenses that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock, which could cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline Various provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws, as well as the Michigan Business Corporation Act (the “MBCA”), could have the effect of discouraging, delaying or preventing a third party from accumulating a large block of our capital stock, engaging in a tender offer and making offers to acquire us, and of inhibiting a change in control, all of which could adversely affect our shareholders’ ability to receive a premium for their shares in connection with any such transaction. For example, our Articles of Incorporation authorize our Board of Directors (our “Board”) to issue up to 4,991,000 shares of Preferred Stock and to determine the price, rights (including conversion rights), preferences and privileges of those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders. If we issue preferred stock in the future that has preference over our Common Stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our Common Stock, the rights of holders of our Common Stock or the market price of our Common Stock could be adversely affected. In addition, the anti-takeover provisions of Michigan law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of Gentherm, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing shareholders. For example, the Company is subject to Chapter 7A of the MBCA, which prohibits us from engaging in a business combination with an interested shareholder for a period of five years after the person becomes an interested shareholder, unless certain conditions are satisfied. We are currently prohibited from making dividend payments on our Common Stock. Furthermore, we do not anticipate paying dividends on our Common Stock in the future Our bank credit facilities generally prohibit payment of dividends on our Common Stock so long as such facilities are outstanding. We have never paid any cash dividends on our Common Stock and do not anticipate paying dividends in the near future. The price of our Common Stock may fluctuate significantly The price of our Common Stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors, including: • general market and economic conditions; • actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results due to such factors as acceptance of our product by automotive manufacturers and consumers, timing of our product introductions, availability and pricing of components from third parties, competition, timing of orders, foreign currency exchange rates, new product development, material acquisitions or dispositions, technological changes, resources spent on litigation activities and economic conditions generally; • changes in earnings guidance by us or earnings estimates by securities analysts with respect to us; • publication of research reports about us, the automotive industry generally or automotive component industry, and recommendations by securities or financial analysts with respect to us or other automotive suppliers; • adverse market reaction to the amount of our outstanding debt at any time, the amount of our maturing debt in the near and medium term and our ability to refinance such debt and the terms thereof or our plans to incur additional debt in the future; • the ability of our customers to pay us and meet their other obligations to us under current contract terms and our ability to hold and expand our customer base; • changes in market valuations of similar companies; 28 • adverse market reaction to any securities we may register or issue or additional debt we incur in the future; • additions or departures of key management personnel; • actions by institutional shareholders; • speculation in the press or investment community; • continuing high levels of volatility in the capital and credit markets; and • the realization of any of the risk factors included in, or incorporated by reference to, this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Many of the factors listed above are beyond our control. These factors may cause the market price of our Common Stock to decline, regardless of our financial performance and condition and prospects. It is impossible to provide any assurance that the market price of our Common Stock will not fall in the future, and it may be difficult for holders to resell shares of our Common Stock at prices they find attractive, or at all. We expect that the market price of our Common Stock will continue to fluctuate. In addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations may materially and adversely affect the market price of our Common Stock. Our shareholders may experience dilution if we issue additional equity securities Subject to the limitations set forth in our Articles of Incorporation, we are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our Common Stock or preferred stock, including securities convertible or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, Common Stock or preferred stock. In most circumstances, common shareholders will not be entitled to vote on whether or not we issue additional equity securities. Future issuances of Common Stock will reduce the percentage of our Common Stock owned by shareholders who do not participate in such issuances. In addition, depending on the terms and pricing of additional offerings of our Common Stock and the value of our assets, our shareholders may experience dilution in the book value and fair value of their shares. The market price of our Common Stock could decline as a result of sales of substantial amounts of additional shares of our Common Stock in the public market or in connection with future acquisitions, or the perception that such sales could occur. This could also impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of equity securities at a time and price favorable to us. I TEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. 29 I TEM 2.

A substantially greater number of holders are beneficial owners whose shares of record are held by banks, brokers and other nominees. Dividends We have not paid any Common Stock cash dividends since formation and we do not expect to pay any in the foreseeable future. The payment of future dividends is within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon business conditions, our earnings and financial condition and other factors. Currently, our bank credit facilities limit payment of dividends on our Common Stock. Stock Repurchase Program In December 2016, the Board of Directors authorized a three-year, $100 million stock repurchase program. In June 2018, our Board of Directors authorized an increase in the stock repurchase plan to $300 million and extended the stock repurchase plan until December 2020. Under the program, we may repurchase, from time to time, our common stock in amounts and at prices as we deem appropriate, taking into account market conditions, applicable legal requirements, debt covenants and other considerations. The number of shares repurchased and the time of the repurchases under the stock repurchase program will be determined by our management. Repurchases may be made on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Repurchases may also be made under a Rule 10b5-1 plan, which would permit shares to be repurchased when we might otherwise be precluded from doing so under securities laws. The authorization of this stock repurchase program does not require we repurchase any specific dollar value or number of shares and may be modified, extended or terminated by our Board of Directors at any time. 31 Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities During Fourth Quarter 2018 Period (a) Total Number of Shares Purchased (1) (b) Average Price Paid per Share (c) Total Number of Shares Repurchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs (d) Approximate Dollar Value of Shares That May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (2) October 1, 2018 to October 31, 2018 888,457 $ 41.80 888,457 $ 190,187,084 November 1, 2018 to November 30, 2018 380,967 $ 44.48 380,967 $ 173,242,300 December 1, 2018 to December 31, 2018 634,090 $ 42.02 634,090 $ 146,599,982 (1) All shares were purchased on the open-market in accordance with Gentherm’s Stock Repurchase Program, including, in part, pursuant to a plan adopted by the Company in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by, our consolidated financial statements (and notes related thereto) and other more detailed financial information appearing elsewhere in this Report. Further, you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with the “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this Report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. See also “Forward-Looking Statements” in Item 1 of this Report. Overview Gentherm Incorporated is a global technology and industry leader in the design, development, and manufacturing of innovative thermal management technologies. Our products provide solutions for automotive passenger comfort and convenience, battery thermal management, remote power generation, patient temperature management, and other consumer and industrial temperature control needs. Our automotive products can be found on the vehicles of nearly all major automotive manufacturers operating in North America, Europe and Asia. We operate in locations aligned with our major customers’ product strategies in order to provide locally enhanced design, integration and production capabilities and to identify future thermal technology product opportunities in both automotive and other markets. We concentrate our research on the development of new technologies and new applications from existing technologies to create product and market opportunities for a wide array of thermal management solutions. Our automotive products are sold to automobile and light truck OEMs or their tier one suppliers. Inherent to the automotive supplier market are costs and commitments that are incurred well in advance of the receipt of orders and resulting revenues from customers. This is due in part to automotive manufacturers requiring the design, coordination and testing of proposed new components and sub-systems. Revenues from these expenditures are typically not realized for two to three years due to this development cycle. Reportable Segments The Company has two reportable segments for financial reporting purposes: Automotive and Industrial. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of our reportable segments as well as their proportional contribution to the Company’s reported product revenues and operating income. The financial information used by our chief operating decision maker to assess operating performance and allocate resources is based on these reportable segments. New Strategic Plan On June 25, 2018, Gentherm announced a new strategic plan intended to improve business performance and position the company to deliver above-market growth and improved profitability to its shareholders. An important element of the strategy is the Fit-for-Growth initiative that focuses on purchasing excellence, rationalization of research and development activities and expenses, reducing selling, general and administrative expense, minimization or elimination of investments in non-core areas and developing a manufacturing footprint commensurate with the new plan. Non-core areas of investment under the Fit-for-Growth initiative are concentrated in the following areas of Gentherm’s industrial segment: Gentherm Global Power Technologies (“GPT”), Cincinnati Sub Zero’s Industrial Chamber business (“CSZ-IC”) and our battery management systems division in Irvine, California. We also completed the site consolidation plan for our advanced research and development operations and vacated two lease facilities in Azusa, California. On February 1, 2019, we completed the sale of CSZ-IC to Weiss Technik North America, Inc. for total cash proceeds of $47.5 million. The strategy also identified several product categories the Company has now exited, including furniture, aviation, battery management electronics, industrial battery packs, automotive thermoelectric generators and other non-core electronics. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for information about our Fit-for-Growth initiative, related cost savings and related restructuring costs. 33 Etratech On November 1, 2017, we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed substantially all of the operating liabilities of Etratech Inc., an Ontario corporation and all of the outstanding shares of Etratech Hong Kong, an entity organized under the laws of Hong Kong, in an all-cash transaction. Etratech manufactures advanced electronic controls and control systems for the automotive, RV and marine, security, medical and other industries. Etratech’s world headquarters and North American manufacturing operations are located in Burlington, Canada. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the acquisition of Etratech. North American Reorganization On January 4, 2016 and January 5, 2016, the Company completed reorganization transactions (the “Reorganization”) related to our North American business (the “Windsor Operations”). As part of our original integration plan to eliminate redundancies associated with the 2011 acquisition of Gentherm GmbH (formerly named W.E.T. Automotive Systems AG), the Windsor Operations have been consolidated into our existing European and North American facilities. As a result of the Reorganization, some of the business activities previously performed by the Windsor Operations are now being performed by other subsidiaries. Related to the Reorganization, the Company declared intercompany dividends, incurred and paid withholding taxes to the Canadian Revenue Agency of $7.6 million during 2016. Additionally, the Company incurred income tax expense of $2.5 million related to the intercompany dividends. These amounts incurred are expected to cover all future intercompany dividends needed to distribute the remaining earnings of the subsidiary to its parent in conjunction with the potential future liquidation of the subsidiary. In addition to the $7.6 million of withholding tax and $2.5 million of income taxes, the Reorganization required the Company to make a one-time income tax payment of approximately $32.6 million. The one-time income tax payment was accrued during the first quarter of 2016; however, the Company also recorded an offsetting deferred charge for approximately the same amount because the one-time income tax payment will result in tax deductions against income taxes in future periods. Therefore, the income tax payment did not have a material impact on the Company’s earnings during the first quarter of 2016 nor any subsequent quarter. The withholding tax payment was paid entirely in 2016. The income tax payments of $2.5 million and $32.6 million were paid during the first quarter of 2017. Critical Accounting Policies The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosures at the date of our financial statements. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. These estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to: • Product revenues; • Impairments of goodwill and other intangible assets • Accrued warranty costs; • Litigation reserves; • Allowances for doubtful accounts; • Inventory reserves; • Income taxes; • Stock compensation; and • Pension plans Product Revenues Revenue is recognized from agreements containing enforceable rights and obligations when promised goods are delivered or services are completed, the price is fixed or determinable, and payment has been received or is collectable. The amount of revenue 34 recognized is net of the Company’s obligation for returns, rebates, discounts, taxes, if any, collected from customers, and consideration th at is paid to a customer, unless such payment is in exchange for a distinct good or service. The amount of revenue recognized from a contract with a customer reflects the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for the transfer of good or services. Automotive Revenues The Company sells automotive seat comfort systems, specialized automotive cable systems and automotive thermal convenience products under long-term supply agreements (“LTAs”) and, for arrangements that are less than one year in length, purchase orders. LTAs are multiple-year business awards to provide custom designed parts for a particular automotive vehicle program in quantities and at intervals of the customer’s choosing. LTAs are often multiple-element agreements. The main element in LTAs are production parts; distinct promises from which the customer can benefit separately from other promises or elements in the contract. A second element in LTAs are production part purchase options that provide customers the ability to purchase additional parts at set prices in the future. Judgement is used to determine whether a production part purchase option represents a material right to the customer and should be accounted for as a separate performance obligation. LTAs that provide customers with a purchase option discount incrementally higher than the range discounts typically given to automotive customers contain a material right. The magnitude of change in the year-over-year option prices and the total number of units expected to be ordered are important factors in the calculation of the option’s fair value and the allocation of transaction price. The price for parts is set at the point in time the customer exercises its option to purchase additional parts from the Company. A firm order, stating the number of each production part to be delivered, is an independent contract with a discrete transaction price. Revenues are allocated to production parts based on the relative standalone selling prices observed on the LTAs. As a practical alternative to estimating the standalone selling price of an option that provides a customer with a material right, the Company allocates transaction price to options by reference to the production part volumes expected to be ordered and the consideration expected to be received. The Company satisfies its obligation to provide product parts to the customer upon shipment. When an option to purchase additional production parts in the future represents a material right, the customer effectively is paying Gentherm in advance for production parts each time it exercises the option by placing a firm order commitment. Revenue from options containing a material right are recognized on the basis of direct measurement of the value of production parts transferred to date relative to the total number of production parts expected to be delivered over the life of the vehicle program. Judgement is required to determine the pattern and timing with which an option containing a material right is satisfied and the production part is transferred to a customer. Industrial Revenues Our industrial business unit generates revenue from the sale of products and services by our wholly-owned subsidiaries CSZ and GPT. Industrial business unit revenues and medical business unit revenues discussed below are reported within the Company’s industrial reportable segment (see Note 9). Industrial business unit customers commonly enter into multiple-element agreements for the purchase of products and services. Installation services, for example, are separate and distinct performance obligations that are often included in contracts to purchase customized environmental test chambers. Depending on the application, delivery of an environmental test chamber or remote power generation system to the customer’s place of business can range from two weeks to nine months from commencement of the contract. Installation services, while reliant on the specifications and timing from the customer, rarely remain incomplete more than two months after delivery. Revenues allocated to environmental test chambers or remote power systems are based on the stand alone selling price of products themselves. Judgement is used to determine the degree to which early pay discounts and other credits are utilized in the calculation of standalone selling price, and only included to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of any incremental revenue will not occur. Revenues are recognized at the point in time the chamber or power system is shipped to the customer. For contracts that also include a promise for installation, the portion of total transaction price allocated to the installation is recognized as revenue at the point in time the installation is complete. Revenues from our medical business unit are generated from the sale of products and equipment. Our medical products and equipment focus on body and blood temperature management. The Company sells medical products and equipment primarily through distributor and group purchasing organization agreements. These agreements allow member participants to the distributor or group 35 purchasing organization to make purchases at discounted prices negotiated by the distributor or group purchasing organization. A rebate is incurred at the point in time a member participant purchases product covered under these types of agreements. Rebates are accounted for as variable consideration, using an expected value, probability weighted approach, based on the level of sales to the distributor and the time lag between the initial sale and the rebate claim in determi ning the transaction price of a contract. Revenue is recognized at the point in time the medical products or equipment is transferred to the customer. Impairments of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that a reporting unit’s fair value is less than its carrying amount, the Company then compares the fair value of the reporting unit to the related net book value. If the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is measured and recognized. The fair value of a reporting unit is estimated by analyzing internal inputs (level 3) to calculate forward values and discounting those values to the present value. Accrued Warranty Costs The Company accrues warranty obligations for products sold based on management estimates of future failure rates and current claim cost experience, with support from the sales, engineering, quality and legal functions. While we believe our warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate, such estimates could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future. The warranty policy is reviewed by management annually. Using historical information available to the Company, including claims already filed by customers, the warranty accrual is adjusted quarterly to reflect management’s best estimate of future claims. Litigation Reserves We record estimated future costs related to new or ongoing litigation based on input from legal counsel and our best estimate of probable loss. These estimates include costs associated with attorney fees and potential claims and assessments less any amounts we anticipate are recoverable under insurance policies. Final resolution of the litigation contingencies could result in amounts different from current accruals and, therefore, have an impact on our consolidated financial results in future reporting periods. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We record an allowance for doubtful accounts once exposure to collection risk of an accounts receivable is specifically identified. We analyze the length of time an account receivable is outstanding, as well as a customer’s payment history to determine the need for and amount of an allowance for doubtful accounts. Inventory Reserves We recognize a reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventories based on estimates of future sales and an inventory item’s capacity to be repurposed for a different use. We consider the number of months supply on hand based on current planned requirements, uncommitted future projections and historical usage in estimating the inventory reserve. Additional provisions are made for supplier claims for obsolete materials, prototype inventory, spare or customer service inventory and, for all periods other than at year-end, estimates for physical inventory adjustments. Income Taxes We record income tax expense using the liability method which specifies that deferred tax assets and liabilities be measured each year based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the applicable enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when management considers it more likely than not that the asset will not be realized. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, a valuation allowance has been provided for certain deferred tax assets which we have concluded are more likely than not to not be realized. If future annual taxable income were to be significantly less than current and projected levels, there is a risk that certain of our deferred tax assets not already provided for by the valuation allowance would expire prior to utilization. We recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. We recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. 36 Stock Based Compensation We account for grants of employee stock options, time-based restricted stock units and restricted stock as compensation expense based upon the fair value on the date of grant and such expense is recognized over the vesting condition, either based on a period of service of based on the performance of a specific achievement. For awards measured at fair value, the fair value is determined using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The Black-Scholes option pricing model incorporates certain assumptions, such as expected volatility, expected life of options, risk-free interest rate and expected dividend yield, in order to arrive at a fair value estimate. Expected volatilities are based on the average of the historical volatility of the Company’s Common Stock and that of an index of companies in our industry group. To evaluate our assumptions for the expected lives of options, we consider the average holding period of previously exercised options and the remaining terms of outstanding options. The risk-free interest rate is based upon quoted market yields for United States Treasury debt securities. The expected dividend yield is based upon the Company’s history of having never issued a dividend, the limitations to issue a dividend under the Amended Credit Agreement and management’s current expectation regarding future dividends. We believe that the assumptions selected by management are reasonable; however, significant changes could materially impact the results of the calculation of fair value. We also have granted restricted stock units measured based on either a target return on invested capital ratio (“ROIC”), as defined in the award agreement, for a specified fiscal year, or the Company’s common stock market price returning a target total shareholder return (“TSR”), as defined, during a specific three-year measurement period. Upon achievement of the performance measurement, performance based restricted stock units vest over a three-year period. Stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) are also an award type granted under out management incentive program and they are accounted for using the liability method since they are settled in cash, which requires mark-to-market adjustments based on the current trading price of Gentherm Common Stock to be recognized in statement of income. Pension Plans The Company’s obligations and expenses for its pension plans are substantially dependent on the Company’s selection of discount rate and, for the Gentherm GmbH Plan, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions used by actuaries to calculate these amounts. Actual results that differ from assumptions used are accumulated and amortized over future periods and generally affect recognized expense in future periods. As such, assumptions used to calculate benefit obligations as of the annual measurement date directly impact the expense to be recognized in future periods. Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2017 Product revenues . Product revenues by product category, in thousands, for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 are as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 % Change Climate Control Seats (CCS) $ 374,816 $ 387,961 (3.4 ) % Seat Heaters 305,337 307,309 (0.6 ) % Steering Wheel Heaters 69,845 62,125 12.4 % Automotive Cables 98,931 92,093 7.4 % Battery Thermal Management (BTM) (a) 28,472 10,043 183.5 % Etratech 54,267 8,398 (1.3 ) % (b) Other Automotive 16,924 11,528 (c) 46.8 % Subtotal Automotive $ 948,592 $ 879,457 7.9 % Remote Power Generation (GPT) 19,222 31,891 (39.7 ) % Cincinnati Sub-Zero Products (CSZ) 70,445 74,335 (5.2 ) % Subtotal Industrial $ 89,667 $ 106,226 (15.6 ) % Total Company $ 1,038,259 $ 985,683 5.3 % a) Battery Thermal Management or BTM product revenues include Gentherm’s automotive grade, low cost, heat resistant fans and blowers used by customer for battery cooling through ventilation and production level shipments of the advanced TED based active cool system which began during the fourth quarter of 2017. 37 b) Amount represents the pro-forma growth for Etratech by comparing the amount of revenue during 2018 t o Etratech’s revenue during 2017 which totaled $54,987 , and which w as not all included in Gentherm’s revenue since the acquisition did not occur until November 1, 2017. c) Includes $2.0 million rebate to customer during 2017. Product revenues for 2018 were $1,038.3 million compared with product revenues of $985.7 million for 2017, an increase of $52.6 million, or 5.3%. The increase included higher product revenues in the automotive segment, which increased $69.1 million, or 7.9%, to $948.6 million, partially offset by lower industrial segment product revenues which decreased $16.6 million, or 15.6%, to $89.7 million. Automotive product revenues for 2018 included $54.3 million from Etratech compared to only $8.4 million in 2017. Gentherm acquired Etratech on November 1, 2017 and recognized product revenues from Etratech during last two months of 2017. Our automotive segment revenues outperformed automotive vehicle product volumes during 2018. Global automotive production decreased 1% during 2018 as compared to 2017. On a combined basis and weighted for the Company’s revenue in each region, automotive vehicle production declined by 1.3% in the Company’s key regions. These lower rates were partially attributable to the negative impact of the new Worldwide Harmonized Light Vehicle Test Procedure (“WLTP”) regulations in Europe. Authorities have been taking longer than expected to certify OEM vehicles under the new WLTP emissions tests, causing production delays. Adjusting for the impact from currency translation and the Etratech acquisition, automotive segment revenues increased 1% in 2018 as compared to 2017. Gentherm achieved higher revenues in our BTM, steering wheel heaters and automotive cable product categories which were partially offset by lower revenues in our CCS and seat heater product categories. BTM revenues contributed the largest increase totaling $18.4 million, or 183.5%, due to the 2018 launches of the actively cooled version on the Mercedes S-Class and the Jeep Wrangler. Other products that experienced significant growth in revenue during 2018 included automotive steering wheel heaters which increased by $7.7 million, or 12.4%, and automotive cables which increased by $6.8 million, or 7.4%. The growth in steering wheel heater product revenues is due to new program awards, which included the Nissan Pathfinder, Nissan Murano, and the Audi A6 and Audi A8 vehicle programs. The growth in automotive cables product revenues is attributable to an increase in Oxygen Sensor business with Bosch, totaling $5.1 million. CCS revenues decreased by $13.1 million, or 3.4%, to $374.8 million due to an unfavorable mix between the higher priced active cooling technology and the lower priced heated and ventilated version. The decrease of $2.0 million, or 1%, in seat heater revenues was concentrated in Europe and Asia due to lower production volumes in those regions in 2018 as compared to 2017. Lower revenues in the industrial segment in 2018 were attributable to decreased revenue of GPT and the CSZ industrial chamber business of $12.7 million, or 39.7%, and $3.7 million, or 8.4%, respectively. During 2018, GPT earned significantly lower revenue due to a decrease in the shipment of custom projects. Lower CSZ industrial chamber business revenues were mainly due to lower product revenues on custom climate testing chambers in 2018. In June 2018, Gentherm announced that GPT and the CSZ industrial chamber business (“CSZ-IC”) would be sold. Both businesses were classified as held for sale on December 31, 2018. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about Gentherm’s new strategic growth plan and, specifically, the February 2019 sale of CSZ-IC and the planned sale of GPT. Cost of sales. Cost of sales increased to $743.6 million during 2018 from $674.8 million during 2017, an increase of $68.8 million, or 10.2%. Higher cost of sales were primarily due to changes in product mix favoring low margin products, including BTM and Etratech products, and lower quantities of higher margin products, including CCS and automotive seat heaters. The low margin realized on BTM product revenues during 2018 was partially due to higher than expected launch phase costs for the new actively cooled technology programs and higher fixed overhead costs, including depreciation expense, that were incurred in anticipation of higher, post-launch phase volumes. Freight costs were $4.2 million higher in 2018 compared to 2017 and were attributable to the ramp-up of production at our Celaya Mexico facility. During 2018, labor costs grew $7.2 million compared to 2017 primarily due to higher sales, higher incurred overtime and higher wage rates at our production facilities in Mexico and Ukraine. Lastly, global tariffs, which became effective during the second half of 2018, contributed $1.3 million in additional costs of sales as compared to 2017. Net research and development expenses. Net research and development expenses were $79.9 million during 2018 compared to $82.5 million in 2017, a decrease of $2.6 million, or 3.1%. The decrease in net research and development expenses was primarily driven by the impact of the Fit-for-Growth cost reduction initiatives and higher-than-normal development and tooling cost reimbursements for new production applications. Research and development reimbursement totaled $18.8 million during 2018 and $12.0 million during 2017, an increase of $6.8 million, or 57%. We classify development and prototype costs and related 38 reimbursements as research and development. This is consistent with accountin g standards applied in the automotive industry. Depreciation costs for tooling are included in cost of sales. Research and development expenses increased $4.1 million, or 4%, to 98.7 million in 2018 due to higher costs for additional resources, including personnel, that are focused on the development of new products, including a program to develop the next generation of seat comfort products, and application engineering for production programs of existing products. The increase also included $1.4 million in foreign currency transaction and research and development expenses of Etratech, which totaled $2.2 million. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $3.4 million, or 2.6%, to $127.2 million during 2018 from $130.5 million during 2017. The decrease was due to CEO transition expenses of $6.7 million during 2017 and savings associated with cost reduction activities of the Company’s Fit-for-Growth initiative of $3.3 million. This decrease was partially offset by selling, general and administrative expenses associated with Etratech totaling $4.9 million, higher mark-to-market adjustment on cash-settled stock options of $2.9 million and higher expenses related to currency translation of $800 thousand. Restructuring expenses. The Company recognized $14.8 million in restructuring expense during 2018 as a result of completed actions associated with the Fit-for-Growth cost savings initiative as more fully described above. The completed Fit-for-Growth actions are expected to deliver annualized saving of approximately $37.0 million. In 2018, $65.0 million in savings opportunities were identified and we expect to achieve our $75.0 million overall savings target by 2021. No restructuring charges were incurred during 2017. Foreign currency gain (loss). During 2018, we incurred a net foreign currency gain of $622 thousand which included a net realized gain of $33 thousand and a net unrealized gain of $589 thousand. During 2017, we incurred a net foreign currency loss of $23.1 million which included an unrealized loss of $21.8 million, The unrealized gain in 2018 and the unrealized loss in 2017 was primarily the result of holding significant amount of U.S. Dollar (“USD”) cash at our subsidiaries in Europe which have the European Euro (“EUR”) as the functional currency and due to certain intercompany relationships between these European subsidiaries and our U.S. based companies. The USD strengthened relative to the EUR in 2018 but had significantly weakened during 2017. If the USD continues to strengthen, we will likely have unrealized gains, but if the USD weaken, we will likely have unrealized losses. Impairment loss. During 2018, the Company recorded an impairment loss totaling $11.5 million associated with the Company’s plans to divest GPT and CSZ-IC, both of which are included in the industrial segment. The loss is not expected to be fully deductible for income tax purposes. No impairment loss was recorded in 2017. Income tax expense. We recorded an income tax expense of $16.2 million during 2018 representing an effective tax rate of 28% on earnings before income tax of $58.1 million. The pre-tax earnings amount included the non-deductible impairment loss of $11.5 million. Adjusting for the impairment loss, the effective tax rate was 23% for 2018. The effective tax rate differed from the U.S. Federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the international provisions of the U.S. tax reform, such as global intangible low-tax income (“GILTI”), enacted in December 2017, partly offset by certain intercompany transactions which disproportionately benefited lower tax rate jurisdictions. We recorded an income tax expense of $34.0 million during 2017 which included the one-time transition tax of $20.2 million relating to the 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). Excluding this one-time expense, our income tax expense would have been $13.8 million representing an effective tax rate of 20% on earnings before income tax of $69.3 million. Industrial segment operating loss. The industrial segment, which includes GPT, CSZ and our advanced research and development activities, reported an operating loss totaling $22.5 million and $14.8 million during 2018 and 2017, respectively. We incurred these losses for several reasons. First, the advanced research and development activities, the total cost for which were $15.6 million and $13.9 million during 2018 and 2017, respectively, are focused on products and technologies that are currently not generating product revenues. Second, in conjunction with the Fit-for-Growth initiative, a number of advanced research activities have been curtailed or ceased and we have executed site consolidations at our Irvine, California and Azusa, California facilities. These changes are expected to lead to lower spending rates in future periods. We expect advanced research activities focused on our core technologies to continue and to generate profitable revenue in future periods, a significant portion of which we expected will be recognized in the Automotive segment. Lastly, CSZ incurred $5.2 million in expenses in 2018 associated with a new direct sale force for the medical business unit that has yet to be fully offset by a corresponding increase in the amount of revenue and related operating income. We continue to believe the direct sales force will lead to higher medical product revenues in future periods that will generate operating profits in excess of the costs for the direct sales team. 39 Results of Operations Year Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2016 Product revenues . Product revenues by product category, in thousands, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 are as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 % Change Climate Control Seats (CCS) $ 387,961 $ 405,795 (4.4 ) % Seat Heaters 307,309 288,939 6.4 % Steering Wheel Heaters 62,125 49,516 25.5 % Automotive Cables 92,093 85,283 8.0 % Battery Thermal Management (BTM) ( a ) 10,043 6,546 53.4 % Etratech 8,398 — — Other Automotive 11,528 ( b ) 11,349 1.6 % Subtotal Automotive $ 879,457 $ 847,428 3.8 % Remote Power Generation (GPT) 31,891 18,628 71.2 % Cincinnati Sub-Zero Products (CSZ) 74,335 51,544 44.2 % Subtotal Industrial $ 106,226 $ 70,172 51.4 % Total Company $ 985,683 $ 917,600 7.4 % a) Battery Thermal Management or BTM product revenues include Gentherm’s automotive grade, low cost, heat resistant fans and blowers used by customer for battery cooling through ventilation and production level shipments of the advanced TED based active cool system which began during the fourth quarter of 2017. b) Includes $2.0 million rebate to customer during 2017. Product revenues for 2017 were $985.7 million compared with product revenues of $917.6 million for 2016, an increase of $68.1 million, or 7.4%. This increase included the full year effect of the 2016 acquisition of CSZ, which operated as a part of Gentherm for a full year in 2017 but only for nine months during 2016, $8.4 million in additional revenue attributable to the 2017 acquisition of Etratech after it was acquired on November 1, 2017, and a $5 million favorable impact of foreign currency translation. Adjusting for these effects, our pro-forma product revenue growth was 4.6% and included a 2.7% increase in Automotive segment product revenues to $879.5 million and a 23.4% increase in Industrial segment product revenue to $106.2 million. The increase in the Automotive segment occurred despite lower global automotive production volumes and a special rebate of $2.0 million recorded during 2017. The increases included higher revenue volume for heated seat products, totaling $18.4 million, or 6.4%, heated steering wheels of $12.6 million, or 25.5%, automotive cable systems of $6.8 million, or 8.0%, and battery thermal management products of $3.5 million, or 53.4%. These higher amounts were attributable to new program awards, higher vehicle application rates and higher component content. Higher component content in heat seat products, for example, included a greater number of programs for which Gentherm provides the electronic controlling device along with the heating element. These increases were partially offset by lower CCS product revenues which decreased by $17.8 million, or 4.4%. CCS product revenue was disproportionately impacted by the lower global production volumes which were more unfavorable in our primary CCS market, North America, which was down by 4%, compared to an increase of 2% for the global automotive industry. CCS revenues were also reduced as a result of certain vehicle programs changing technologies from the higher priced active cooling seat application to the lower priced heated and ventilated seat technology. Product revenues from GPT totaled $31.9 million which represented an increase of $13.3 million, or 71%. Continuing market weakness in North America was more than offset by higher sales to other markets. Product sales in this business unit are typically large custom remote power systems having long lead times and, during 2017, there were more shipments than in the prior year. During 2016, demand for GPT’s products sold in North America was unfavorably impacted by lower oil prices. While we do not generally sell our products for oil exploration, production or transportation activities, the impact of lower oil prices reduced capital investments for the natural gas industry being made by GPT’s principal customers. As a result, those customers curtailed orders during that year. 40 CSZ product revenue increased by $22.8 million which included b oth an acquisition related increase of $15.9 million and organic growth of $6.9 million, or 10%. This increase included higher revenue of environmental chamber products totaling $8.1 million or 22% partially offset by lower revenue of patient temperature management products of $1.2 million or 3.9%. The higher revenue for environmental chambers included several large custom orders as well as stronger demand for standard chambers. Patient temperature management product revenue equally benefited 2017 and 2 016 from a temporary surge in demand for the Hemotherm product, a blood heater cooler used in hospital operating rooms during open heart surgery, but did not yet show improvements associated with a transition to a direct sales force that occurred throughou t 2017. Cost of sales. Cost of sales increased to $674.8 million in 2017 from $622.6 million in 2016. The increase of $52.2 million, or 8%, was due to increased sales volume, unfavorable inventory adjustments, other increased expenses and changes in product mix partially offset by a one-time $4.0 million expense from the purchase accounting effect of inventory for the CSZ acquisition which occurred in 2016. The gross margin rate was 31.6% during 2017 representing a decrease of 60 basis points as compared with the 2016 gross margin rate of 32.2%. This decrease was due to the special rebate and the inventory adjustments and the higher expenses. The unfavorable inventory adjustments totaled $2.3 million and were mainly comprised of a reserve recorded for inventory held for the heated and cooled mattress product line based upon a reduced sales outlook. Increased expenses totaling approximately $7.0 million included higher fixed costs associated with our new manufacturing facilities in Mexico and Macedonia, labor expense inflation at our Ukraine factory, and factory launch expenses for the new advanced battery thermal management product and electronics. Net research and development expenses. Net research and development expenses were $82.5 million during 2017 compared to $72.9 million in 2016, an increase of $9.6 million, or 13%. This increase was primarily driven by higher costs for additional resources, including personnel focused on application engineering for new production programs of existing products, development of new products and a program to develop the next generation of seat comfort products. Increases in research and development were partially offset by research and development reimbursement totaling $12.0 million during 2017 and $6.7 million during 2016. Acquisition transaction expenses. During 2017, we incurred $789 thousand in fees and expenses associated with the acquisition of Etratech which was completed on November 1, 2017. During 2016, we incurred $743 thousand in fees and expenses associated with the acquisition of CSZ which was completed on April 1, 2016. Selling, general and administrative expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $130.5 million , which included $1.1 million in selling, general and administrative expenses for Etratech and $6.1 million in higher expenses for CSZ due to the additional three months of operations during 2017 as compared to 2016, the year CSZ was acquired. Excluding the Etratech expenses and additional CSZ expenses, selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $8.1 million, or 7%, from $115.3 million in the prior year. This increase was partly due to expenses associated with the transition to a new CEO, higher selling costs for CSZ’s medical products business, and increased management incentive compensation costs partially offset by a one-time expense associated with a management reorganization totaling $2.0 million incurred in 2016 but not 2017. During 2017 our former CEO, Daniel R. Coker, retired and as a result, we recorded expenses totaling $6.7 million which included accelerated stock compensation amortization and accrued cash bonus. The amount also included a signing bonus and a make whole bonus for Mr. Coker’s successor and fees associated with the recruitment process. CSZ’s selling expenses include an increase of $3.9 million associated with a direct sales force for its medical division started during 2017. Lastly, expenses for our management incentive program were $968 thousand higher during 2017 as compared to 2016. Foreign currency gain (loss). During 2017 we incurred a net foreign currency loss of $23.1 million which included a net realized loss of $1.3 million and a net unrealized loss of $21.8 million. During 2016, we incurred a net foreign currency gain of $7.8 million which included a net realized gain of $1.7 million and a net unrealized gain of $6.1 million. The unrealized loss in 2017 and the unrealized gain in 2016 was primarily the result of holding significant amounts of U.S. Dollar (“USD”) cash at our subsidiaries in Europe which have the European Euro (“EUR”) as the functional currency and due to certain intercompany relationships between these European subsidiaries and our U.S. based companies. During 2017, the USD significantly weakened relative to the EUR but strengthened during 2016. 41 Income t ax e xpense. We recorded an income tax expense of $34.0 million during 2017 which included the one-time transition tax of $20.1 million rela ting to the Tax Act. Excluding this one-time expense, our income tax expense would have been $13.9 million representing an effective tax rate of 20% on earnings before income tax of $69.3 million. We recorded an income tax expense of $34.0 million during 2016 which included the one-time withholding tax expense of $7.6 million and income tax expense of $2.5 million related to the Reorganization. Excluding these one-time expenses, our income tax expense would have been $23.9 million representing an effecti ve tax rate of 22% on earnings before income tax of $110.6 million. The Tax Act was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Tax Act reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on all offshore earnings that were previously tax deferred and creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings. As of December 31, 2017, in accordance with guidance provided by Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), we have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act; however, in certain cases, as described below, we have made a provisional estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax. In the year ended December 31, 2017, the provision for income taxes includes a provisional income tax expense of $20.2 million related to items for which we were able to determine a reasonable estimate. In all cases, we will continue to make and refine our calculations as additional analysis is completed. In addition, our estimates may be affected as additional regulatory guidance is issued with respect to the Tax Act. Any adjustments to the provisional amounts will be recognized as a component of the provision for income taxes in the period in which such adjustments are determined, but in any event, no later than the fourth quarter of 2018, in accordance with SAB 118. Deferred tax assets and liabilities . We remeasured our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities at 21%. However, we were still analyzing certain aspects of the Tax Act and refining our calculations, which could have potentially affected the measurement of these balances or potentially give rise to new deferred tax amounts. In the year ended December 31, 2017, the provision for income taxes includes provisional income tax expense of $5.8 million related to the remeasurement of deferred tax balances. Transition tax on deferred foreign earnings. The one-time transition tax is based on our post-1986 earnings and profits (“E&P”) that were previously deferred from U.S. income taxes. In the year ended December 31, 2017, the provision for income taxes includes provisional income tax expense of $23.9 million related to the one-time transition tax liability of our foreign subsidiaries. We have not completed our calculation of the total post-1986 E&P for these foreign subsidiaries. Further, the transition tax is based in part on the amount of those earnings held in cash and other specified assets. This amount may change when we finalize the calculation of post-1986 E&P previously deferred from U.S. income taxes and the amounts held in cash or other specified assets. A benefit of $9.6 million was included in the provision for income taxes to offset the one-time transition tax related to the previous deferred tax liability that existed for the undistributed foreign earnings that were not permanently reinvested. However, we continue to recognize a deferred tax liability related to foreign withholding tax that will be incurred for undistributed foreign earnings that are not permanently reinvested. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information about the one-time transition tax. Industrial segment operating loss. The Industrial segment, which includes CSZ, GPT and our advanced research and development activities, reported an operating loss totaling $14.8 million and $16.7 million during 2017 and 2016, respectively. The loss during 2016 included the one-time purchase accounting adjustment related to the CSZ acquisition. After adjusting for this one-time expense, the 2017 loss was $2.0 million, or 16%, higher than the loss in the Industrial segment, as adjusted, in 2016. We incurred these losses for three reasons. First, the advanced research and development activities, the total cost for which were $13.9 million and $12.1 million, during 2017 and 2016, respectively, are focused on products and technologies that are currently not generating product revenues. Second, CSZ incurred approximately $2.0 million in cost overruns on several large customer environmental test chambers during 2017. These cost overruns are not expected to recur in future periods. Finally, CSZ’s $3.9 million in higher expenses in 2017 associated with the new direct sales force was not yet offset by a corresponding increase in the amount of revenue and related operating income. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash and Cash Flows The Company has funded its financial needs primarily through cash flows from operating activities and equity and debt financings. Our new strategic plan sets forth a capital allocation strategy that includes a targeted debt-to-earnings leverage ratio and allows for some of our cash flow to be paid back to investors through Common Stock repurchases. On June 25, 2018, our Board of Directors increased the Company’s stock repurchase authorization to $300 million, of which $146.6 million of availability remained 42 as of December 3 1 , 2018. This aut horization expires on December 1 6 , 2020. Based on its current operating plan, management believes cash and cash equivalents at December 3 1 , 2018, together with cash flows from operating activities, and borrowing availab le under our credit agreement, are sufficient to meet operating and capital expenditure needs, and to service debt, for at least the next 12 months. However, if cash flows from operations decline, we may need to obtain alternative sources of capital and re duce or delay capital expenditures, acquisitions and investments, all of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, it is likely that we will need to complete one or more equity or debt financings if we consummate any significant acquisition or several smaller acquisitions. There can be no assurance that such capital will be available at all or on reasonable terms, which could adversely affect our futu re operations and business strategy. The following table represents our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments: December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 (in Thousands) Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period $ 103,172 $ 177,187 Cash from operating activities 118,434 49,880 Cash used in investing activities (40,757 ) (117,688 ) Cash from financing activities (139,266 ) (31,564 ) Foreign currency effect on cash and cash equivalents (1,963 ) 25,357 Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 39,620 $ 103,172 Cash Flows From Operating Activities We manage our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments to fund operating requirements and preserve liquidity to take advantage of future business opportunities. The following table compares the cash flows from operating activities earned during 2018 with those earned in 2017: Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 Change Operating Activities : (in Thousands) Net income $ 41,899 $ 35,227 $ 6,672 Non-cash adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided by operating activities: Depreciation and amortization 50,638 44,972 5,666 Deferred income taxes 6,699 5,135 1,564 Stock compensation 9,047 12,507 (3,460 ) Defined benefit pension plan expense 82 (23 ) 105 Provision for doubtful accounts (1 ) (469 ) 468 Loss on sale of property and equipment 2,602 1,042 1,560 Impairment loss 11,476 — 11,476 Net income before non-cash adjustments 122,442 98,391 24,051 Changes in operating assets and liabilities: Accounts receivable 3,024 6,033 (3,009 ) Inventory (7,689 ) (4,348 ) (3,341 ) Prepaid expenses and other assets (4,428 ) (12,334 ) 7,906 Accounts payable 12,380 (7,691 ) 20,071 Accrued liabilities (7,295 ) (30,171 ) 22,876 Net cash provided by operating activities 118,434 49,880 68,554 43 Cash provided by operating activities during 2018 was $ 118.4 million representing an increase of $ 68.6 million from cash provided by operating activi ties during 2017, which was $49.9 million . The following table highlights signific ant differences between the operating cash flows for the periods ending December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively: (in Thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities during 2017 $ 49,880 Higher net income before changes in operating assets and liabilities 24,051 Changes in working capital, net 46,843 Changes in other assets and liabilities (2,340 ) Net cash provided by operating activities during 2018 $ 118,434 Net cash provided by operating activities before changes in operating assets and liabilities increased during 2018 due to higher revenues partially offset by higher cash based operating expenses and impairment losses recognized on goodwill, other intangible asset and assets held for sale of $6.2 million, $3.1 million and $2.2 million, respectively. Additionally, working capital, net provided favorable cash flows related to accounts receivable and accrued liabilities and unfavorable amounts related to inventory, prepaid expenses and other assets and accounts payable. Working Capital The following table illustrates changes in working capital during 2018: (in Thousands) Working capital at December 31, 2017 $ 289,754 Decrease in cash (61,768 ) Decrease in accounts receivable (13,932 ) Decrease in inventory (6,552 ) Increase in tax receivables, net 14,801 Increase in prepaid expenses and other assets (722 ) Increase in accounts payable (5,494 ) Decrease in accrued liabilities 1,743 Current assets classified as held for sale, net 10,717 Non-current assets classified as held for sale 46,833 Foreign currency effect on working capital (7,701 ) Working capital at December 31, 2018 $ 267,679 The following table highlights significant transactions that contributed to the decrease in cash experienced during the year ended December 31, 2018: (in Thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 118,434 Purchases of property and equipment (41,541 ) Repayments of Debt (99,460 ) Borrowings from U.S. Revolving Note 94,679 Stock repurchases (148,074 ) Proceeds from the exercise of Common Stock options 14,777 Other items (583 ) Decrease in cash $ (61,768 ) In addition to these transactions, working capital was impacted by decreases in accounts receivable, inventory, prepaid expenses and other assets, and accrued liabilities and increases in accounts payable. The changes in current assets and liabilities reflects the classification of GPT and CSZ-IC (disposal group) as held for sale during 2018. All assets and liabilities of the disposal group are classified as held for sale within current assets and current liabilities, respectively, on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet for the year ended December 31, 2018. See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statement for additional information about the assets and liabilities classified as held for sale. Lastly, Gentherm recognized an increase in current tax receivable relating to timing of required payment to tax authorities. 44 Cash Flows From Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities was $40.8 million during 2018, reflecting purchases of property and equipment related to the expansion of production capacity, including at our newest facilities in Mexico, Vietnam, Macedonia and our Etratech facility in Canada. Cash Flows From Financing Activities Cash used in financing activities was $139.3 million during 2018, reflecting payments of principal on the U.S. Revolving Note, the DEG China Loan and the DEG Vietnam Loan totaling $99.5 million in aggregate, partially offset by additional borrowings on the U.S. Revolving Note totaling $94.7 million. As of December 31, 2018, the total availability under the U.S. Revolving Note was $221.9 million. Cash was also paid to repurchase Common Stock totaling $148.1 million, and for cancellations of restricted stock awards totaling $1.2 million. Debt The Company, together with certain direct and indirect subsidiaries, has an outstanding credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a consortium of lenders and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent. The Credit Agreement provides the Company a revolving credit note (“U.S. Revolving Note”) with a maximum borrowing capacity of $350 million. All subsidiary borrowers and guarantors participating in the Credit Agreement have entered into a related pledge and security agreement. The security agreement grants a security interest to the lenders in substantially all of the personal property of subsidiaries designated as borrowers to secure their respective obligations under the Credit Agreement, including the stock and membership interest of specified subsidiaries (limited to 66% of the stock in case of certain non-US subsidiaries). The Credit Agreement restricts the amount of dividend payments the Company can make to shareholders. The Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio and a Consolidated Leverage Ratio. Definitions for these financial ratios are provided in the Credit Agreement. Under the Credit Agreement, U.S. Dollar denominated loans bear interest at either a base rate (“Base Rate Loans”) or Eurocurrency rate (“Eurocurrency Rate Loans”), plus a margin (“Applicable Rate”). The base rate is equal to the highest of the Federal Funds Rate (2.40% at December 31, 2018) plus 0.50%, Bank of America’s prime rate (5.50% at December 31, 2018), or a one month Eurocurrency rate (0.00% at December 31, 2018) plus 1.00%. The Eurocurrency rate for loans denominated in U.S. Dollars is equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate (2.50% at December 31, 2018). In April 2018, the Credit Agreement was amended to establish a means for determining an alternative for LIBOR if it is determined that ascertaining LIBOR is no longer possible. All loans denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar must be Eurocurrency Rate Loans. Interest is payable at least quarterly. The Applicable Rate varies based on the Consolidated Leverage Ratio reported by the Company. As long as the Company is not in default of the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement, the lowest and highest possible Applicable Rate is 1.25% and 2.00%, respectively, for Eurocurrency Rate Loans and 0.25% and 1.00%, respectively, for Base Rate Loans. The Company also has two fixed interest rate loans with the German Investment Corporation (“DEG”), a subsidiary of KfW banking group, a German government-owned development bank. The first, a loan we used to fund capital investments in China (the “DEG China Loan”), is subject to semi-annual principal payments that began March, 2015 and will end September, 2019. Under the terms of the DEG China Loan, the Company must maintain a minimum Debt-to-Equity Ratio, Current Ratio and Debt Service Coverage Ratio, as defined by the DEG China Loan agreement, based on the financial statements of Gentherm’s wholly owned subsidiary, Gentherm Automotive Systems (China) Ltd. The Company’s second fixed interest rate senior loan agreement with DEG was used to finance the construction and set up of the Vietnam production facility (“DEG Vietnam Loan”). The DEG Vietnam Loan is subject to semi-annual principal payments that began November, 2017 and will end May, 2023. Under the terms of the DEG Vietnam Loan, the Company must maintain a minimum Currency Ratio, Equity Ratio and Enhanced Equity Ratio, each as defined by the DEG Vietnam Loan agreement, based on the financial statements of Gentherm’s wholly owned subsidiary, Gentherm Vietnam Co. Ltd. 45 The following table summarizes the Company’s debt at December 31, 2018 ( dollars in thousands). Interest Rate Principal Balance Credit Agreement: U.S. Revolving Note (U.S. Dollar Denominations) 4.02 % $ 122,000 U.S. Revolving Note (Euro Denominations) 1.50 % 5,727 DEG China Loan 4.25 % 913 DEG Vietnam Loan 5.21 % 11,250 Total debt 139,890 Current portion (3,413 ) Long-term debt, less current maturities $ 136,477 As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all terms as outlined in the Credit Agreement, DEG China Loan and DEG Vietnam Loan. Undrawn borrowing capacity under the U.S. Revolving Note was $221.9 million as of December 31, 2018. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Revenue from Contracts with Customers In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers.” ASU 2014-09 was developed to enable financial statement users to better understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The update’s core principal is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those good or services. Issuers are to use a five-step contract review model to ensure revenue is measured, recognized, and disclosed in accordance with this principle. The FASB issued several amendments to the update, including a one-year deferral of the original effective date, and new methods for identifying performance obligations that are intended to reduce the cost and complexity of compliance. We adopted ASU 2014-09 and related amendments effective January 1, 2018 using the cumulative catch-up transition method, which required us to disclose the cumulative effect of initially applying the update recognized at the date of initial application. We elected to apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to contracts that were not completed at January 1, 2018. The most significant impact from adoption of ASU 2014-09 occurred within our Automotive segment and relates to our accounting for production part purchase options that grant customers a material right to purchase additional parts under long-term supply agreements in the future. Due to the complexity of certain of our automotive supply contracts, the actual revenue recognition treatment for customer purchase options will depend on contract-specific terms and could vary from other contracts that are similar in nature. Revenue recognition related to goods and services reported in the Industrial segment remains substantially unchanged. 46 The amount by which each financial statement line item was affected by application of ASU 2014-09 and related amendments during the period ended December 31, 2018 , in thousands, is as follows: Revenue Based on Previously Effective Guidance New Revenue Standard Adjustment Revenue Based on New Revenue Standard Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2018 Product revenues $ 1,035,773 $ 2,486 $ 1,038,259 Income tax expense (benefit) 16,727 507 16,220 Net income 39,920 1,979 41,899 Basic earnings per share 1.11 0.06 1.17 Diluted earnings per share 1.10 0.06 1.16 Revenue Based on Previously Effective Guidance New Revenue Standard Adjustment Revenue Based on New Revenue Standard Balance Sheet December 31, 2018 Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts $ 166,858 $ — $ 166,858 Accrued liabilities (a) $ 64,211 $ 1,597 $ 65,808 Unearned revenue (a) $ — $ 1,597 $ 1,597 Deferred income taxes, net $ 62,522 $ 325 $ 62,847 Accumulated earnings $ 365,237 $ (1,272 ) $ 363,965 a) During 2018, unearned revenues associated with GPT and CSZ-IC were classified as liabilities held for sale. As of December 31, 2018, 5,351 in unearned revenues associated with GPT and CSZ-IC were classified as liabilities held for sale. Adoption of ASU 2014-09 and related amendments had no impact to cash from or used in operating, investing or financing activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows. Statement of Cash Flows In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.” ASU 2016-15 provides guidance on the classification of eight specific cash receipt and cash payment transactions in the statement of cash flows. The Company focused its evaluation on the following transactions to determine the effect ASU 2016-15 will have on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows: 1) Debt extinguishment payments and debt prepayments are to be shown as cash outflows for financing activities. Previously, Gentherm classified debt extinguishment payments within operating activities. 2) Payments made to settle contingent consideration liabilities not made soon after the acquisition date of a business combination should be recognized as cash outflows for financing activities up to the amount of the liability recognized at the acquisition date. Payments, or the portion of a payment, to settle contingent consideration liabilities that exceed the amount of the liability recognized at the acquisition date will be recognized as cash outflows for operating activities. 3) Cash receipts from the settlement of insurance claims, excluding those related to corporate-owned life insurance policies shall be classified on the basis of the related insurance coverage. For example, proceeds received to cover claims issued under product recall liability insurance would be classified as cash inflows from operating activities. 4) Cash receipts from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies shall be classified as cash inflows from investing activities. We have adopted ASU 2016-15 and related amendments effective January 1, 2018. None of the cash receipt and cash payment transactions addressed by the update occurred during any of the periods presented in this report. Adoption of this update and related amendments did not have a material impact on the cash flows of the Company. 47 Income Taxes In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory.” ASU 2016-16 modifies the current prohibition to recognize deferred income taxes from differences between the tax basis of assets in the buyer’s tax jurisdiction and their cost resulting from an intra-entity transfer from one tax-paying component to another tax-paying component of the same consolidated group. Under current GAAP, deferred income taxes for intra-entity asset transfers are not recognized until the asset is sold to an outside party. ASU 2016-16 allows entities to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. We adopted ASU 2016-16 and related amendments effective January 1, 2018 on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of such adoption date. As a result of the amendments in ASU 2016-16, a favorable adjustment of $31,645 was recorded directly to retained earnings. The new deferred tax assets will be recognized ratably over the useful life of the applicable assets. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, “Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.” ASU 2018-02 provides a remedy to a narrow-scope financial reporting issue created by the Tax Act. The Tax Act required entities to adjust deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the impact from newly enacted lower corporate income tax rates, and recognize the effect in income from continuing operations. This requirement applied to all deferred tax assets and liabilities, even those which arose from transactions originally recognized in other comprehensive income. The amendments in ASU 2018-02 allow adjustments to deferred tax assets and liabilities due to newly enacted lower corporate income tax rates to be recognized in retained earnings, if those deferred tax balances arose from transactions originally recognized in other comprehensive income. Income tax effects are released from accumulated other comprehensive income and recorded against the deferred tax balance in the consolidated balance sheet when the underlying activity is realized. ASU 2018-02 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption of the amendments in this update is permitted, including adoption in any interim period for which financial statements have not yet been issued. The amendments in ASU 2018-02 must be applied in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period in which the effect of the change in U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in the Tax Act is recognized. We elected to early adopt ASU 2018-02 and related amendments effective January 1, 2018. An adjustment of $40 was recognized against retained earnings for effect of the change in the federal corporate income tax rate on deferred tax amounts. There are no related adjustments to the Company’s valuation allowance and no other income tax effects from the Tax Act on balances that remain in accumulated other comprehensive income were reclassified. Tax Act In January 2018, the FASB released guidance on the accounting for tax on the global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) provisions of the Tax Act. The GILTI provisions impose a tax on foreign income in excess of deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. During 2018, the Company elected to treat any potential GILTI inclusions as a period cost. Goodwill Impairment In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, “Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.” ASU 2017-04 modified the concept of impairment of goodwill to be a condition that exists when the carrying value of a reporting unit that includes goodwill exceeds its fair value. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Entities no longer will determine goodwill impairment by calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by assigning the fair value of a reporting unit to all of its assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. 48 ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual and any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption of the amendments in this update is permitted. The amendments in ASU 2017 -04 must be applied on a prospective basis and in the initial period of adoption, entities must disclose the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle. The Company has adopted the accounting principles in ASU 2017-04 and applied them to o ur test for goodwill impairment. See Note 12 for information about the goodwill impairment loss recognized in 2018. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted Derivatives and Hedging In October 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-16, “Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Inclusion of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Overnight Index Swap (OIS) Rate as a Benchmark Interest Rate for Hedge Accounting Purposes.” ASU 2018-16 adds the OIS Rate based on SOFR to the list of eligible benchmark interest rates that can be used for hedge accounting purposes under Topic 815. SOFR is a volume-weighted median interest rate that is calculated daily based on overnight transactions from the prior day’s trading activity in specified segments of the U.S. Treasury repo market. The designation of the OIS rate based on SOFR as a benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes is in response to ongoing concerns about the sustainability of LIBOR and the Federal Reserve’s intent to have a suitable alternative to USD LIBOR that is more firmly based on actual transactions in a robust market. Prior to this update, the only eligible benchmark interest rates were the interest rates on direct Treasury obligations of the U.S. government (UST), the LIBOR swap rate, the OIS Rate based on the Fed Funds Effective Rate and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) Municipal Swap Rate. ASU 2018-16 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption of the amendments in this update is permitted. The amendments in this update should be adopted on a prospective basis for qualifying new or redesigned hedging relationships entered into on or after the date of adoption. While the Company has not executed any U.S. benchmark interest rate transactions in order to apply hedge accounting under Topic 815, we are currently in the process of determining the impact implementation of ASU 2018-16 will have on our strategy approach to the management of interest rate risk. Cloud Computing Arrangements That Are Service Contracts In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, “Intangibles – Goodwill and Other – Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract.” ASU 2018-15 provides guidance on when costs incurred to implement a hosting arrangement that is a service contract are and are not capitalized, aligning with the guidance for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. Entities must first determine the project stage of the implementation activity; depending on their nature, costs for implementation activities in the application development stage are capitalized and costs incurred during the preliminary project and post-implementation stages are expensed as the activities are performed. Capitalized implementation costs should be amortized over the term of the hosting arrangement on a straight-line basis and presented in the same line items in the consolidated statement of income as the expense for fees for the associated hosting arrangements. Similarly, capitalized implementation costs should be presented in same line item in the balance sheet as prepaid fees for the associated hosting arrangement and cash flows from capitalized implementation costs should be classified in the same manner as cash flows for the fees for the associated hosting arrangement. ASU 2018-15 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption of the amendments in this update is permitted, including adoption in any interim period for which financial statements have not yet been issued. ASU 2018-15 permits two methods of adoption: prospectively to costs for activities performed on or after the date the entity first applies the content from the update, or retrospectively to all periods presented. We are currently in the process of determining the impact implementation of ASU 2018-15 will have on the Company’s financial statement note disclosures. Retirement Benefits In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, “Compensation – Retirement Benefits – Defined Benefit Plans – General (Subtopic 715-20): Disclosure Framework – Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans.” The amendments in ASU 2018-14 were developed using the concepts incorporated in the FASB’s Concepts Statement, Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting – Chapter 8: Notes to Financial Statements, which were finalized in August 2018. The amendments in this update remove the following disclosure requirements, among others, from Subtopic 715-20: 49 1) The amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income expected to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year. 2) The amount and timing of plan assets expected to be returned to the employer. The following disclosure requirements were added to Subtopic 715-20: 1) The weighted-average interest crediting rates for cash balance plans and other plans with promised interest crediting rates. 2) An explanation of the reasons for significant gains and losses related to changes in the benefit obligation for the period. ASU 2018-14 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2020. Early adoption of the amendments in this update are permitted. Entities should apply the amendments in this update on a retrospective basis to all periods presented. We are currently in the process of determining the impact implementation of ASU 2018-14 will have on the Company’s financial statement note disclosures. Fair Value Measurement In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework – Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement.” The amendments in ASU 2018-13 were developed using the concepts incorporated in the FASBs Concepts Statement, Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting – Chapter 8: Notes to Financial Statements, which were finalized in August 2018. The amendments in this update remove the following disclosure requirements from Topic 820: 1) The amount of and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 2) The policy for timing of transfer between levels. 3) The valuation processes for Level 3 fair value measurements. The following disclosure requirements were added to Topic 820: 1) The changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period included in other comprehensive income for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements held at the end of the reporting period. 2) The range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements. ASU 2018-13 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption of disclosures that are removed is permitted, but adoption is delayed for the new additional disclosures until their effective date. The amendments in ASU 2018-13 that provide for new additional disclosure should be applied on a prospective basis, while all other amendments should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented upon their effective date. We are currently in the process of determining the impact implementation of ASU 2018-13 will have on the Company’s financial statement note disclosures. Leases In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842).” ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize on their balance sheet a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. Payments to be made in optional periods should be included in the measurement of lease assets and liabilities if the lessee is reasonably certain it will exercise an option to extend the lease or not exercise an option to terminate the lease. While ASU 2016-02 continues to differentiate between finance or capital leases and operating leases, the principal change from current lease accounting guidance is that lease assets and liabilities arising from operating leases will be recognized on the balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption of the amendments in this update are permitted. The FASB has issued several amendments to ASU 2016-02, including ASU 2018-11, “Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements” that introduced an additional transition method permitting an entity to initially apply the new lease standard at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. We expect to elect this transition method. 50 ASU 2016-02 includes optional practical expedients intended to reduce the cost and complexity to implement the new lease standard, such as an option to maintain the current lease classification for all existing lease arrangements and the option to use hind sight in evaluating lessee options to extend or terminate a lease. We expect to elect these practical expedients. The Company expects to add right-of-use assets and the corresponding liabilities to the consolidated balanc e sheet equal to approximately 1.5 % to 2.5 % of total assets as of the implementation date. Any difference s between the total carrying value of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities will be recognized as a reduction to the 2019 opening balance in retained earnings. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We use letters of credit to guarantee our performance under specific construction contracts executed by our subsidiaries, GPT and CSZ. The expiration dates of the letter of credit contracts coincide with the expected completion date of the contract. Extensions are normally made if performance obligations continue beyond the expected completion date. At December 31, 2018, we had outstanding letters of credit of $455 thousand. Tabular Disclosure of Contractual Obligations As of December 31, 2018, the following amounts, aggregated by type of contract obligation, are known to come due in the periods stated: Contractual Obligations (In thousands) Total Less than 1 Yr 1-3 Yrs 3-5 Yrs More than 5 Yrs Long-Term Debt Obligations (1) $ 139,890 $ 3,413 $ 132,727 $ 3,750 $ — Operating Lease Obligations $ 18,718 $ 4,686 $ 6,327 $ 3,684 $ 4,021 Purchase Obligations $ 4,001 $ 2,844 $ 1,157 $ — $ — Totals $ 162,609 $ 10,943 $ 140,211 $ 7,434 $ 4,021 (1) Long-Term Debt Obligations do not include an amount payable for interest. The Company does not have any outstanding capital lease agreements. I TEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations and foreign currency contracts. We have in the past, and may in the future, place our investments in bank certificates of deposits, debt instruments of the U. S. government, and in high-quality corporate issuers. We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, short-term interest rates and price fluctuations of certain material commodities such as copper. Market risks for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our debt obligations under our Amended Credit Agreement. Foreign currency exchange risks are attributable to sales to foreign customers and purchases from foreign suppliers not denominated in a location’s functional currency, foreign plant operations, intercompany indebtedness, intercompany investments and include exposures to the European Euro, Mexican Peso, Canadian Dollar, Hungarian Forint, Macedonian Denar, Ukrainian Hryvnia, Japanese Yen, Chinese Renminbi, Korean Won and Vietnamese Dong. The Company regularly enters into derivative contracts with the objective of managing its financial and operational exposure arising from these risks by offsetting gains and losses on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the financial instruments used to hedge them. The maximum length of time over which we hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange risks is one year. We had foreign currency derivative contracts with a notional value of $33.3 million and $29.3 million outstanding at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. 51 The maximum length of time over which we hedge our exposure to price fluctuations in material commodities is two years. We had copper commodity swap contracts with a notional value of $ 0 and $ 404 thousand outstanding at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Our hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedge, and hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions both at the inception of a hedge and on an ongoing basis to be designated for hedge accounting treatment. For derivative contracts which can be classified as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheet. When the underlying hedge transaction is realized, the gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive loss is recorded in earnings in the consolidated statement of income on the same line as the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. We record the ineffective portion of foreign currency hedging instruments, if any, to foreign currency gain (loss) in the consolidated statements of income. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for the amount of unrealized loss associated with copper commodity derivatives reported in accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 31, 2017 that was reclassified into earnings during 2018. Though we continuously monitor the hedging program, derivative positions and hedging strategies, foreign currency forward exchange agreements have not always been designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. The Company uses an income approach to value derivative instruments, analyzing quoted market prices to calculate the forward values and then discounts such forward values to the present value using benchmark rates at commonly quoted intervals for the instrument’s full term.

I TEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE None. I TEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Disclosure Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. In designing and evaluating disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance of achieving the desired objectives. Also, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations of all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty and that breakdowns can 54 occur because of a simple error or mistake. The design of any system of controls is based, in part, upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Our management has evaluated, with the participation of our principal executive and principal financial officers, the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2018. Based on their evaluation, our principal executive and principal financial officers have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2018 due to a material weakness in internal control over financial reporting described below. Management’s Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions and dispositions of assets, (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors, and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, misstatements due to error or fraud, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis or not at all. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, we assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31,2018 using the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013). Based on this assessment, it was identified that our Information Technology General Controls (“ITGC”) related to a stand-alone system at our wholly owned subsidiary, Cincinnati Sub-Zero Products, LLC., did not operate in a way to appropriately restrict elevated access and address segregation of duty conflicts at both the information technology and end user levels. This impaired our ability to rely on the completeness and accuracy of the system generated data used in the execution and testing of our financial controls for this subsidiary. Due to the pervasiveness of the ITGC weakness noted above and the way in which the financial controls rely on the effectiveness of these controls and system generated data, we concluded that this represented a material weakness. The Company did not maintain a control environment that was designed and operating in a way to prevent or detect a material misstatement in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. Despite the above noted material weakness, management believes that our consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have certified that, based on each such officer’s knowledge, the financial statements, and other financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, fairly present in all material respects our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows as of, and for, the periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. There was no adjustment required as a result of this material weakness. In addition, we have developed a remediation plan for this material weakness, which is described below. Based on the assessment described above, management of the Company believes that, as of December 31, 2018, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective. Our independent registered public accounting firm, Grant Thornton LLP, independently assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as stated in its report included herein, which report expressed an adverse opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018. Remediation Management plans to remediate the material weakness noted at the Cincinnati Sub-Zero Products, LLC by enhancing financial statement review controls and decommissioning the stand-alone system and integrating the location into the Company’s global 55 information technology environment. Although we believe that these corrective steps, when taken, will enable management to conclude that the internal control over financial reporting are effective, we cannot provide assurance that these steps will be sufficient or the timing thereof. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Gentherm’s internal control over financial reporting, expect as otherwise described in Item 9a.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), and our report dated February 26, 2019 expressed an adverse opinion. Basis for opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. /s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2007. Southfield, Michigan February 26, 2019 F-2 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Board of Directors and Shareholders Gentherm Incorporated Opinion on internal control over financial reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Gentherm Incorporated (a Michigan corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weakness described in the following paragraphs on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, the Company has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by COSO. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of control deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weakness has been identified and included in management’s assessment. The Company’s internal controls over the general information technology (“IT”) environment and IT general controls (“ITGC”) at a wholly owned subsidiary did not operate in a way to appropriately restrict elevated access and address segregation of duty conflicts at both the information technology and end user levels. This impairs the Company’s ability to rely on the completeness and accuracy of the system generated data used in the execution and testing of financial controls for this entity. Due to the pervasiveness of the ITGC weakness noted and the way in which the financial controls rely on the effectiveness of these controls and system generated data, it is concluded that this represented a material weakness. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2018. The material weakness identified above was considered in determining the nature, timing, and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2018 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated February 26, 2019 which expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report On Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial F-3 statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s as sets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Other Information We do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the Company’s remediation plan disclosed as part of Management’s Report on Internal Control. /s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP

STATEMENTS (In thousands, except share and per share data) Note 1 — The Company Gentherm Incorporated is a global technology and industry leader in the design, development, and manufacturing of innovative thermal management technologies. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms “Company”, “we”, “us” and “our” used herein refer to Gentherm Incorporated and its consolidated subsidiaries. Our products provide solutions for automotive passenger comfort and convenience, battery thermal management, remote power generation, patient temperature management, environmental product testing and other consumer and industrial temperature control needs. Our automotive products can be found on the vehicles of nearly all major automotive manufacturers operating in North America, Europe and Asia. We operate in locations aligned with our major customers’ product strategies to provide locally enhanced design, integration and production capabilities and to identify future thermal technology product opportunities in both automotive and other markets. We concentrate our research on the development of new technologies and new applications from existing technologies to create product and market opportunities for a wide array of thermal management solutions. New Strategic Plan On June 25, 2018, Gentherm announced a new strategic plan intended to improve business performance and position the Company to deliver above-market growth and improved profitability to its shareholders. An important element of the strategy is the Fit-for-Growth initiative that focuses on purchasing excellence, rationalization of research and development activities, reducing selling, general and administrative expense, minimization or elimination of investments in non-core areas and developing a manufacturing footprint commensurate with the new plan. Non-core areas of investment under the Fit-for-Growth initiative are concentrated in the following areas of Gentherm’s industrial segment: Non-core areas of investment under the Fit-for-Growth initiative are concentrated in the following areas of Gentherm’s industrial segment: Gentherm Global Power Technologies (“GPT”), Cincinnati Sub Zero’s Industrial Chamber business (“CSZ-IC”) and our battery management systems division in Irvine, California. We also completed the site consolidation plan for our advanced research and development operations and vacated two lease facilities in Azusa, California. On February 1, 2019, we completed the sale of CSZ-IC to Weiss Technik North America, Inc. for total cash proceeds of $47.5 million. The strategy also identified several product categories the Company has now exited, including furniture, aviation, battery management electronics, industrial battery packs, automotive thermoelectric generators and other non-core electronics. Fit-for-Growth The Fit-for-Growth cost savings initiative began in January 2018. Consultant costs associated with the initiative were reported in restructuring expenses. The total amount of consultant costs incurred during 2018 was $2,852. We expect to incur an additional $600 thousand in consultant costs in the first quarter of 2019 from implementing Fit-for-Growth. Gentherm also recognized $6,598 in one-time employee termination costs in restructuring expenses pertaining to Fit-for-Growth. Gentherm recognized $17 in contract termination costs in restructuring expenses pertaining to Fit-for-Growth. Advanced Research and Development Rationalization and Site Consolidation In June 2018, Gentherm completed a sale of its battery management systems division located in Irvine, California. A loss on the sale of $1,107 was recognized in restructuring expenses. F-10 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Note 1 – The Company – (Continued) Gentherm has completed its site consolidation plan of advanced research and development operations and vacated the two leased facilities in Azusa, California. Gentherm recognized $643 in contract termination costs in restructuring expenses from implementing our site consolidation plan. Gentherm recognized $1,094 in one-time employee termination costs in restructuring expenses pertaining to the site consolidation plan of advanced research and development operations. Lastly, Gentherm recognized $1,400 in restructuring expenses for the disposal of long-lived assets controlled and used in Azusa, California. GPT and CSZ-IC During 2018, Gentherm launched a program to actively market GPT and CSZ-IC to potential buyers and initiated all other actions required to complete the divestiture plan. Gentherm incurred $304 in consultant costs in restructuring expenses to launch the sales plan and does not expect to incur additional consultant costs associated with the plan in the future. Lastly, Gentherm recognized $757 in one-time employee termination costs in restructuring expenses related to the divestiture process. See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the assets and liabilities classified as held for sale.

The cumulative amount of restructuring expenses incurred and recognized in the industrial reporting segment during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $5,608. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our reportable segments as well as their proportional contribution to the Company’s reported product revenues and operating income. Etratech On November 1, 2017, we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed substantially all of the operating liabilities of Etratech Inc., an Ontario corporation and all of the outstanding shares of Etratech Hong Kong, an entity organized under the laws of Hong Kong, in an all-cash transaction. Etratech manufactures advanced electronic controls and control systems for the automotive, recreational vehicle, marine, security, medical and other industries. Etratech’s world headquarters and North American manufacturing operations are located in Burlington, Canada. See Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the acquisition of Etratech. F-11 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Note 1 — The Company – (Continued) North American Reorganization On January 4, 2016 and January 5, 2016, the Company completed reorganization transactions (the “Reorganization”) related to our North American business (the “Windsor Operations”). As part of our original integration plan to eliminate redundancies associated with the 2011 acquisition of Gentherm GmbH (formerly named W.E.T. Automotive Systems AG), the Windsor Operations have been consolidated into our existing European and North American facilities. As a result of the Reorganization, some of the business activities previously performed by the Windsor Operations are now being performed by other subsidiaries. Related to the Reorganization, the Company declared intercompany dividends, incurred and paid withholding taxes to the Canadian Revenue Agency of $7,600 during 2016. Additionally, the Company incurred income tax expense of $2,500 related to the intercompany dividends. These amounts incurred are expected to cover all future intercompany dividends needed to distribute the remaining earnings of the subsidiary to its parent in conjunction with the potential future liquidation of the subsidiary. In addition to the $7,600 of withholding tax and $2,500 of income taxes, the Reorganization required the Company to make a one-time income tax payment of approximately $32,600. The one-time income tax payment was accrued during the first quarter of 2016; however, the Company also recorded an offsetting deferred charge for approximately the same amount because the one-time income tax payment will result in tax deductions against income taxes in future periods. Therefore, the income tax payment did not have a material impact on the Company’s earnings during the first quarter of 2016 nor any subsequent quarter. The withholding tax payment was paid entirely in 2016. The income tax payments of $2,500 and $32,600 were paid during the first quarter of 2017. No payments related to the Reorganization were made in 2018. Reportable Segments The Company has two reportable segments for financial reporting purposes: Automotive and Industrial. Automotive The Automotive reporting segment is comprised of the results from our global automotive businesses. Operating results from our climate comfort systems, specialized automotive cable systems, battery thermal management, and automotive electronic and software systems are all reported in the Automotive segment because of their complementary focus on automotive content, passenger thermal comfort and convenience. Etratech’s operating results are included within Gentherm’s Automotive segment due to the concentration of product applications within the automotive, RV and marine industries. Climate comfort system solutions include seat heaters, variable temperature Climate Control Seats (“CCS”) designed to provide individualized thermal comfort to automobile passengers, and integrated electronic components, such as blowers and electronic control units and that utilize our proprietary electronics technology and software. Other climate comfort system solutions include steering wheel heaters, neck climate control systems and surface climate control system products for doors, armrests, cupholders and storage bins. Industrial The Industrial reporting segment represents the combined results from our remote power generation systems business, our patient temperature management systems business, our environmental testing equipment business and our advanced research and product development division. Our remote power generation systems business is managed by our subsidiary Gentherm Global Power Technologies (“GPT”) and our patient temperature management and environment test equipment businesses are managed by our subsidiary Cincinnati Sub-Zero (“CSZ”). The advanced research and product development division is engaged in projects to improve the efficiency and functionality of thermal management technologies and to develop, market, and distribute products based on these new technologies. The operating results from these businesses and division are presented together as one reporting segment because of their joint concentration on identifying new markets and product applications based on thermal management technologies. F-12 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Note 1 — The Company – (Continued ) See Note 9 of the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the Company’s segment revenues from external customers, including geographic composition, operating income, depreciation and amortization, and goodwill. Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation Consolidation The consolidated financial statements at and for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, reflect the consolidated financial position and consolidated operating results of the Company. Investments in affiliates in which Gentherm does not have control but does have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies, are accounted for under the equity method. Intercompany accounts have been eliminated in consolidation. Certain reclassifications of prior year’s amounts have been made to conform with the current year’s presentation. Notably, results from asset disposals during 2017 were reclassified from other income to cost of sales. Use of Estimates The presentation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Revenue Recognition Revenue is recognized from agreements containing enforceable rights and obligations when promised goods are delivered or services are completed, the price is fixed or determinable, and payment has been received or is collectable. The amount of revenue recognized is net of the Company’s obligation for returns, rebates, discounts, taxes, if any, collected from customers, and consideration that is paid to a customer, unless such payment is in exchange for a distinct good or service. The amount of revenue recognized from a contract with a customer reflects the amount of consideration expected to be received in exchange for the transfer of goods or services. Automotive Revenues The Company sells automotive climate comfort solution, specialized automotive cable systems and automotive thermal convenience products under long-term supply agreements (“LTAs”) and, for arrangements that are less than one year in length, purchase orders. LTAs are multiple-year business awards to provide custom designed parts for a particular automotive vehicle program in quantities and at intervals of the customer’s choosing. LTAs are often multiple-element agreements. The main element in LTAs are production parts; distinct promises from which the customer can benefit separately from other promises or elements in the contract. A second element in LTAs are production part purchase options that provide customers the ability to purchase additional parts at set prices in the future. Judgement is used to determine whether a production part purchase option represents a material right to the customer and should be accounted for as a separate performance obligation. LTAs that provide customers with a purchase option discount incrementally higher than the range discounts typically given to automotive customers contain a material right. The magnitude of change in the year-over-year option prices and the total number of units expected to be ordered are important factors in the calculation of the option’s fair value and the allocation of transaction price. F-13 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounti ng Policies and Basis of Presentation – (Continued) The price for parts is set at the point in time the customer exercises its option to purchase additional parts from the Company. A firm order, stating the number of each production part to be delivered, is an independent contract with a discrete transaction price. Revenues are allocated to production parts based on the relative standalone selling prices observed on the LTAs. As a practical alternative to estimating the standalone selling price of an option that provides a customer with a material right, the Company allocates transaction price to options by reference to the production part volumes expected to be ordered and the consideration expected to be received. The Company satisfies its obligation to provide product parts to the customer upon shipment. When an option to purchase additional production parts in the future represents a material right, the customer effectively is paying Gentherm in advance for production parts each time it exercises the option by placing a firm order commitment. Revenue from options containing a material right are recognized on the basis of direct measurement of the value of production parts transferred to date relative to the total number of production parts expected to be delivered over the life of the vehicle program. Judgement is required to determine the pattern and timing with which an option containing a material right is satisfied and the production part is transferred to a customer. Industrial Revenues Our industrial business unit generates revenue from the sale of products and services by our wholly-owned subsidiaries CSZ and GPT. Industrial business unit revenues and medical business unit revenues discussed below are reported within the Company’s industrial reportable segment (see Note 9). Industrial business unit customers commonly enter into multiple-element agreements for the purchase of products and services. Installation services, for example, are separate and distinct performance obligations that are often included in contracts to purchase customized environmental test chambers. Depending on the application, delivery of an environmental test chamber or remote power generation system to the customer’s place of business can range from two weeks to nine months from commencement of the contract. Installation services, while reliant on the specifications and timing from the customer, rarely remain incomplete more than two months after delivery. Revenues allocated to environmental test chambers or remote power systems are based on the stand alone selling price of products themselves. Judgement is used to determine the degree to which early pay discounts and other credits are utilized in the calculation of standalone selling price, and only included to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of any incremental revenue will not occur. Revenues are recognized at the point in time the chamber or power system is shipped to the customer. For contracts that also include a promise for installation, the portion of total transaction price allocated to the installation is recognized as revenue at the point in time the installation is complete. Revenues from our medical business unit are generated from the sale of products and equipment. Our medical products and equipment focus on body and blood temperature management. The Company sells medical products and equipment primarily through distributor and group purchasing organization agreements. These agreements allow member participants to the distributor or group purchasing organization to make purchases at discounted prices negotiated by the distributor or group purchasing organization. A rebate is incurred at the point in time a member participant purchases product covered under these types of agreements. Rebates are accounted for as variable consideration, using an expected value, probability weighted approach, based on the level of sales to the distributor and the time lag between the initial sale and the rebate claim in determining the transaction price of a contract. Revenue is recognized at the point in time the medical products or equipment is transferred to the customer. Contract Balances We record a receivable when revenue is recognized at the time of invoicing and unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. For contracts where control of the goods or service is transferred to the customer over time, or whose terms require the customer to make milestone payments throughout the fulfillment period, the timing of revenue recognition is likely to differ from the timing of invoicing to customers. F-14 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation – (Continued) The opening balance of our accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts, was $185,058 as of January 1, 2018. Most of Gentherm’s unearned revenue pertains to LTAs containing a material right. In the early periods of an LTA containing a material right, when payments collected from the customer are greater than the standalone selling price of the production parts, revenue associated with the material right is deferred. In future periods, when amounts collected from customers as payment is less than the standalone selling price of the production parts delivered, the deferred revenue is reversed into revenue. For LTAs containing a material right and, thus, the timing of revenue recognition is likely to differ from the timing of invoicing to customer, the aggregate amount of transaction price allocated to material rights that remained unsatisfied under LTAs as of December 31, 2018 was $1,597. We expect to recognize into revenue, 64% of this balance in 2019, and the remaining 19%, 10%, 4%, 3% in 2020, 2021 , 2022 and 2023, respectively. Gentherm often requires milestone payments for contracts to provide environmental test chambers or remote power systems to customers. Milestone payments do not provide the Company with a right to payment for the work completed to date and do not represent the satisfaction of a performance obligation. Milestone payments are deferred and reported within unearned revenue until construction is complete and the unit has been delivered or is installed. If the environmental test chamber contract includes a separate promise to provide installation services, any installation-related payments received from the customer are deferred until the point in time the installation is complete. The total amount of unearned revenue associated with environmental chamber and remote power system contracts, including environmental chamber contracts that include a separate obligation to provide installation, that existed as of December 31, 2018 was $5,296. Unearned revenue associated with environmental chamber and remote power system contracts is classified within Liabilities held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2018 and within Accrued liabilities. See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statement for information about the assets and liabilities classified as held for sale. This entire balance is expected to be recognized into revenue during the next 12 months. See Note 16 for information regarding the unearned revenue associated with these arrangements, including unearned revenue by segment and amounts recognized into revenue during the year ended December 31, 2018. Payment terms for contracts with customers generally range from 30 to 120 days from the date of shipment of goods or completion of service or, if applicable, the scheduled milestone payment due date, and do not include components designed to provide customers with financing. For 2018, our revenues from sales to our three largest customers, Lear, Adient and Bosch Automotive were $181,000, $166,900 and $79,900, respectively, representing 17%, 16% and 8% of our total revenues, respectively. Assets Recognized from the Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if the benefits of those costs are expected to be realized for a period greater than one year. Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were immaterial during 2018 and are included in prepaid expenses and other assets and other non-current assets. Cash and Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of less than 90 days to be cash equivalents. Cash balances in individual banks may exceed the federally insured limit by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The Company had cash and cash equivalents of $33,955 and $88,440 held in foreign jurisdictions as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. F-15 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Note 2 – Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation – ( Continued ) Disclosures About Fair Value of Financial Instruments The carrying amounts of financial instruments comprising cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable approximate fair value because of the short maturities of these instruments. The carrying amount of the Company’s U.S. Revolving Note approximates its fair value because interest charged on the loan balance is variable. See Note 11 for information about the techniques used to assess the fair value of financial assets and liabilities, including our fixed rate debt instruments. Concentration of Credit Risk Financial assets, which subject the Company to concentration of credit risk, consist primarily of cash equivalents, short-term investments and accounts receivable. Cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds managed by major financial services companies. The credit risk for these cash equivalents is considered low. The Company does not require collateral from its customers. As of December 31, 2018, Lear, Adient and Faurecia comprised 21%, 18% and 9% respectively, of the Company’s accounts receivable balance. As of December 31, 2017, Lear, Adient, and Magna comprised 24%, 20% and 7% respectively, of the Company’s accounts receivable balance. These accounts are currently in good standing. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We record an allowance for doubtful accounts once exposure to collection risk of an account receivable is specifically identified. We analyze the length of time an account receivable is outstanding, as well as a customer’s payment history and ability to pay to determine the need to record an allowance for doubtful accounts. Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows: December 31, 2018 2017 Balance at beginning of year $ 973 $ 1,391 Additions charged to costs 1,005 1,239 Recoveries recognized in costs (1,006 ) (1,708 ) Reclassified to assets held for sale (96 ) — Adjustment due to currency translation (25 ) 51 Balance at end of year $ 851 $ 973 Inventory The Company’s inventory is measured at the lower of cost or market, with cost being determined using the first-in first-out basis. Raw materials, consumables and commodities are measured at cost of purchase and unfinished and finished goods are measured at cost of production, using the weighted average method. If the net realizable value expected on the reporting date is below cost, a write-down is recorded to adjust inventory to its net realizable value. We recognize a reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventories based on estimates of future sales and an inventory item’s capacity to be repurposed for a different use. We consider the number of months supply on hand based on current planned requirements, uncommitted future projections and historical usage in estimating the inventory reserve. Additional provisions are made for supplier claims for obsolete materials, prototype inventory, spare or customer service inventory and, for all periods other than at year-end, estimates for physical inventory adjustments. F-16 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation – (Continued) The following is a reconciliation of the changes in the inventory reserve: December 31, 2018 2017 Balance at beginning of year $ 7,887 $ 4,790 Expense 2,712 3,521 Inventory write off (3,282 ) (726 ) Reclassified to assets held for sale (899 ) — Adjustment due to currency translation (148 ) 302 Balance at end of year $ 6,270 $ 7,887 Property and Equipment Property and equipment, including additions and improvements, are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. When property or equipment is retired or otherwise disposed of, the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts. Gains or losses from retirements and disposals are recorded as operating income or expense. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives of the Company’s property and equipment are as follows: Asset Category Useful Life Buildings and building improvements 2 to 50 years Plant and Equipment 1 to 20 years Production tooling 2 to 7 years Leasehold improvements Term of lease Computer equipment and software 1 to 10 years Capital Leases Term of lease The Company recognized depreciation expense of $36,270, $32,224 and $24,873 for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in conjunction with business combinations are based on the Company’s estimate of fair value, as of the date of acquisition. The fair value and corresponding useful lives for acquired intangible assets are listed below as follows: Asset Category Useful Life Customer relationships 8-15 years Technology 2-10 years Production Development Costs 5-10 years Our business strategy largely centers on designing products based upon internally developed and purchased technology. When possible, we protect these technologies with patents. Our policy is to expense all costs associated with the development and issuance of new patents as incurred. Such costs are classified as research and development expenses in our consolidation statements of income. F-17 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation – (Continued) Patents purchased as part of a business combination are capitalized based on their fair values. Periodically, we review the recoverability and remaining lives of our capitalized patents, and if necessary, make adjustments to reported amounts, based upon unfavorable impacts from market conditions, the emergence of competitive technologies and changes in our projected business plans. A total of $14,043, $12,425 and $12,675 in other intangible assets, including capitalized patent costs, were amortized in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. An estimate of intangible asset amortization by year, is as follows: 2019 $ 10,464 2020 8,710 2021 7,887 2022 7,853 2023 7,853 Thereafter 13,619 Impairments of Long-Lived Assets, Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill Whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that a long-lived asset’s fair value, other intangible asset’s fair value or a reporting unit’s fair value is less than it’s carrying amount, the Company then compares the fair value of the long-lived asset, other intangible asset or reporting unit to the related net book value. If the net book value of a long-lived asset, other intangible asset or reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value. The fair value of a long-lived asset, other intangible asset or reporting unit is estimated by analyzing internal inputs (level 3) to calculate forward values and discounting those values to the present value. During 2018, Gentherm determined GPT and CSZ-IC met the held for sale criteria, described below, and recorded an impairment loss on assets held for sale, goodwill and other intangible assets of $2,190, $6,151 and $3,135, respectively. An impairment of long-lived assets, goodwill or other intangible assets did not occur during the periods ending December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. A roll forward of goodwill from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2018 is as follows: December 31, 2016 $ 51,735 Goodwill arising from the acquisition of Etratech 14,881 Exchange rate impact 3,069 December 31, 2017 $ 69,685 Reclassification to assets held for sale (6,844 ) Impairment of goodwill (6,151 ) Exchange rate impact (1,379 ) December 31, 2018 $ 55,311 Accrued Warranty Costs The Company accrues warranty obligations for products sold based on management estimates of future failure rates and current claim cost experience, with support from the sales, engineering, quality and legal functions. Using historical information available to the Company, including claims already filed by customers, the warranty accrual is adjusted quarterly to reflect management’s best estimate of future claims. F-18 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation – (Continued) The following is a reconciliation of the changes in accrued warranty costs for the reporting period: December 31, 2018 2017 Balance at beginning of year $ 5,382 $ 5,443 Warranty claims paid (905 ) (979 ) Warranty expense for products shipped during the current period 2,678 3,162 Adjustments to warranty estimates from prior periods (608 ) (2,655 ) Reclassification to liabilities held for sale (1,884 ) — Adjustment due to currency translation (149 ) 411 Balance at end of year $ 4,514 $ 5,382 Tooling The Company incurs costs related to tooling used in the manufacture of products sold to its customers. In some cases, the Company enters into contracts with its customers whereby the Company incurs the costs to design, develop and purchase tooling and is then reimbursed by the customer under a reimbursement contract. Tooling costs that will be reimbursed by customers are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets at the lower of accumulated cost or the customer reimbursable amount. Approximately $6,628 and $6,994 of reimbursable tooling was capitalized within prepaid expenses and other current assets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Company-owned tooling is included in property and equipment and depreciated over its expected useful life, generally two to seven years. Management periodically evaluates the recoverability of tooling costs, based on estimated future cash flows, and makes provisions, where appropriate, for tooling costs that will not be recovered. Research and Development Expenses Research and development activities are expensed as incurred. The Company groups development and prototype costs and related reimbursements in research and development. The Company recognizes amounts due as reimbursements for expenses as these expenses are incurred. Income Taxes The Company records income tax expense using the liability method which specifies that deferred tax assets and liabilities be measured each year based on the difference between the financial statement and tax base of assets and liabilities at the applicable enacted tax rates. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets when management considers it more likely than not that the asset will not be realized. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, a valuation allowance has been provided for certain deferred tax assets which the Company has concluded are more likely than not to not be realized. If future annual taxable income were to be significantly less than current and projected levels, there is a risk that certain of our deferred tax assets not already provided for by the valuation allowance would expire prior to utilization. The Company recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense. F-19 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation – (Continued) Derivative Financial Instruments – Hedge Accounting The Company accounts for some of its derivative financial instruments as cash flow hedges as defined in Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 815. For derivative contracts which can be classified as a cash flow hedge, the effective potion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheet. When the underlying hedge transaction is realized, the gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income is recorded in earnings in the consolidated statement of income on the same line as the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. Any ineffective portion of the gain or loss is recognized in the income statement under foreign currency (loss) gain or revaluation of derivatives gain (loss). These hedging transactions and the respective correlations meet the requirements for hedge accounting. Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of Common Stock outstanding during the respective period. The Company’s diluted earnings per common share give effect to all potential shares of Common Stock outstanding during a period that are not anti-dilutive. In computing the number of diluted shares outstanding, the treasury stock method is used in order to arrive at a net number of shares created upon the conversion of Common Stock equivalents. Stock Based Compensation Share based payments that involve the issuance of Common Stock to employees, including grants of employee stock options, restricted stock, and time-based and performance-based restricted stock units, are recognized in the financial statements as compensation expense based upon the fair value on the date of grant. Performance-based restricted stock unit awards are measured based on either a target return on invested capital ratio (“ROIC”), as defined in the award agreement, for a specified fiscal year, or the Company’s common stock market price returning a target total shareholder return (“TSR”), as defined, during a specific three-year measurement period. Upon achievement of the performance measurement, performance based restricted stock units vest over a three-year period. Share based payments that are satisfied only by the payment of cash, such as stock appreciation rights, are accounted for as liabilities. The liability is reported at market value of the vested portion of the underlying units. During each period, the change in the liability is recorded as compensation expense during periods when the liability increases or income during periods in which the liability decreases. The Company’s stock-based compensation expense and related deferred tax benefit were $12,177 and $2,434, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2018, $12,727 and $4,339, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2017, and $8,147 and $2,891, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016. Pension Plans The Company’s obligations and expenses for its pension plans are dependent on the Company’s selection of discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and other assumptions used by actuaries to calculate these amounts. F-20 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Note 2 — Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Basis of Presentation – (Continued) Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale The Company classifies assets and liabilities (disposal groups) to be sold as held for sale in the period in which all of the following criteria are met: management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the disposal group; the disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such disposal groups; an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the disposal group have been initiated; the sale of the disposal group is probable, and transfer of the disposal group is expected to qualify as a completed sale within one year, except if events or circumstances beyond the Company’s control extend the period of time required to sell the disposal group beyond one year; the disposal group is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn. The Company initially measures a disposal group that is classified as held for sale at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell. Any loss resulting from this measurement is recognized in the period in which the held for sale criteria are met. Gains are not recognized on the sale of a disposal group until the date of sale. The Company assesses the fair value of a disposal group, less any costs to sell, each reporting period it remains classified as held for sale and reports any subsequent losses as an adjustment to the carrying value of the disposal group. The Company reports assets and liabilities of the disposal group in the line items assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in the period the disposal group meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale. See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statement for information about the assets and liabilities classified as held for sale. Subsequent Events We have evaluated subsequent events through the date that our consolidated financial statements are issued. On February 1, 2019, we completed the sale of CSZ-IC and the CSZ headquarters facility to Weiss Technik North America, Inc. for total cash proceeds of $47,500.

The measurement period begins in the reporting period that includes the Tax Act’s enactment date, which was December 22, 2017, and ends when the additional information is obtained, prepared, or analyzed to complete the accounting requirements under ASC Topic 740. The measurement periods should not extend beyond one year from the enactment date. F-22 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Note 4 — Income Taxes – (Continued) As of December 31, 2018, the Company evaluated the provisional amounts initially recorded for the year ended December 31, 2017 and recorded adjustments based on updates to the Company’s assumptions and the application of additional interpretative guidance as issued during 2018. The adjustments are primarily a result of refining the net deferred tax asset position with the completion of our 2017 U.S. income tax return and changing tax accounting methods that affected the timing of certain US tax deductions. These adjustments resulted in (i) a decrease in our existing deferred tax asset balances which resulted in an income tax expense of $4,950 and (ii) a net increase to the one-time transition tax which resulted in an income tax expense of $24,625. No adjustment was required to the $9,578 tax benefit included in the provision for income taxes as of December 31, 2017 to offset the one-time transition tax related to the previous deferred tax liability that existed for the undistributed foreign earnings that were not permanently reinvested. As of December 31, 2018, the total income tax expense was $19,997 for the year ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the provisional estimate of $20,153. In accordance with the Security and Exchange Commission’s Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118 (SAB 118), at December 31, 2018, the Company had completed its accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act. The deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities and related valuation allowance were comprised of the following: December 31, 2018 2017 Deferred tax assets: Net operating losses 7,666 12,731 Intangible assets 42,853 — Research and development credits 8,211 27,257 Depreciation 6,321 5,571 Valuation reserves and accrued liabilities 4,849 6,020 Foreign tax credit 376 — Stock compensation 4,128 3,955 Inventory 1,069 2,062 Patents 150 163 Defined benefit obligation 1,796 1,977 Other credits 1,291 589 Unrealized foreign currency exchange loss — 2,556 Other 2,499 36 81,209 62,917 Valuation allowance (9,977 ) (27,578 ) Deferred tax liabilities: Intangible assets — (2,925 ) Unrealized foreign currency exchange gains (554 ) — Undistributed profits of subsidiary (4,352 ) (6,450 ) Property and equipment (2,896 ) (1,611 ) Other (583 ) (548 ) (8,385 ) (11,534 ) Net deferred tax asset $ 62,847 $ 23,805 F-23 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Note 4 — Income Taxes – (Continued) Reconciliations between the statutory Federal income tax rate of 21% and 34% and the effective rate of income tax expense for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018 are as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Statutory Federal income tax rate 21.0 % 34.0 % 34.0 % Increase (Decrease) resulting from: U.S. Taxes on foreign income, net of taxes paid credit — — 1.3 % Change in valuation allowance (6.6 %) 10.6 % 5.3 % Foreign, state and local tax, net of Federal benefit 1.8 % 0.8 % 1.1 % Nondeductible expenses 3.4 % 2.4 % 2.4 % Stock option compensation — (2.2 %) — Research and development credits (2.5 %) (4.6 %) (0.7 %) Effect of different tax rates of foreign jurisdictions (6.6 %) (20.8 %) (15.0 %) Undistributed profits of subsidiaries 1.2 % 5.8 % 7.9 % Tax reform items 10.8 % 29.1 % — Other tax exempt income — — — Tax effects of intercompany transfers 0.8 % (5.0 %) (5.3 %) Other 4.6 % (1.0 %) (0.3 %) Effective rate 27.9 % 49.1 % 30.7 % The Company has Net Operating Loss (“NOL”) carryforwards as follows: Jurisdiction Amount as of December 31, 2018 Years of Expiration U.S. Federal and state income tax $ 80,337 2019- 2037 Foreign $ 15,912 2019- 2038 Foreign $ 5,776 Indefinite A portion of the U.S. Federal NOLs was incurred prior to the June 8, 1999 Preferred Financing, which qualified as a change in ownership under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”). Due to this change in ownership, the NOL accumulated prior to the change in control can only be utilized against current earnings up to a maximum annual limitation of approximately $591. As a result of the annual limitation, approximately $2,191 remaining of these carryforwards are expected to expire before ultimately becoming available to reduce future tax liabilities in addition to $17,158 in NOLs generated prior to the change in control which have already expired without being utilized. We have incurred NOLs in various states associated with the benefits of the state dividends received reduction along with the foreign royalty exclusion. The state net operating loss carryforwards expire at various dates from 2019 to 2037. Management has concluded that it is more likely than not that a majority of these NOLs will not be utilized, and thus has not recognized the benefit of these NOLs. At December 31, 2018, certain non-U.S. subsidiaries have net operating loss carryforwards totaling $21,688. This amount includes $15,912 in NOLs that expire at various dates from 2019 through 2038 and the remaining $5,776 have no expiration date. The Company has a valuation allowance recorded against $5,746 of the total non-U.S. subsidiaries’ net operating loss carryforwards as of December 31, 2018. In 2014 through 2018, we incurred NOLs in Vietnam associated with the startup activities of new production facilities. The remaining NOLs are expected to be utilized in 2019 through 2020 as the locations maintain profitability. We also incur NOLs in Luxembourg associated with our foreign holding company legal structure. Management has concluded that it is more likely than not these NOLs will not be utilized, and thus has not recognized the benefit of these NOLs. F-24 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Note 4 — Income Taxes – (Continued) On January 1, 2017, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-09, “Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting.” Under the new standard, income tax benefits and deficiencies are recognized as an income tax expense or benefit in the income statement and the tax effects of exercised or vested awards should be treated as discrete items in the period they occur. The update also requires the Company to recognize excess tax benefits regardless of whether the benefit reduces taxes payable in the current period. The standard also required a modified retrospective adoption for previously unrecognized excess tax benefits. Accordingly, the Company recognized a deferred tax asset and a corresponding credit to retained earnings equal to $1,496 in conjunction with the adoption. The effects of adopting the other provisions of ASU 2016-09 resulted in approximately 2% reduction of the effective tax rate during 2017. The earnings before income taxes and our tax provision are comprised of the following: Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Income before income taxes : Domestic $ 10,092 $ 1,258 $ 12,981 Foreign 48,027 67,997 97,582 Total income before income taxes $ 58,119 $ 69,255 $ 110,563 Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Current income tax expense (benefit): Federal $ 340 $ 4,140 $ 9,215 State and local (71 ) 150 749 Foreign 9,224 24,672 32,844 Total current income tax expense $ 9,493 $ 28,962 $ 42,808 Deferred income tax expense (benefit): Federal $ (1,422 ) $ 15,207 $ (10,597 ) State and local 20 2,308 (742 ) Foreign 8,129 (12,449 ) 2,496 Total deferred income tax expense $ 6,727 $ 5,066 $ (8,843 ) Total tax expense $ 16,220 $ 34,028 $ 33,965 As of December 31, 2018 the previously recognized deferred taxes related to earnings from foreign subsidiaries has been reversed since all of these earnings are subject to the one-time transition tax and are not taxable upon repatriation to the United States. However, the Company continues to provide a deferred tax liability for foreign withholding tax that will be incurred with respect to the undistributed foreign earnings that are not permanently reinvested. The Company is subject to taxation in the United States and various state and foreign jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2018, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. Federal examinations by tax authorities for tax years before 2014 and is no longer subject to foreign examinations by tax authorities for tax years before 2012. During 2015, to entice the Company to construct a new facility in Macedonia, the government of Macedonia granted the Company a tax holiday that released the Company from the obligation to pay corporate income taxes for a ten year period, subject to certain limitations. The amount of corporate income tax savings realized by the Company as a result of this tax holiday during 2018 and 2017, respectively, was zero as a result of operating losses generated during each period. The aggregate dollar effect and per share effect of the corporate income tax holiday during 2018 and 2017 was, therefore, immaterial. F-25 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Note 4 — Income Taxes – (Continued) At December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the Company had total unrecognized tax benefits of $2,854, $4,522 and $4,486, respectively, all of which, if recognized, would affect the effective income tax rates. The reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Balance at beginning of year $ 4,522 $ 4,486 $ 4,443 Additions based on tax position related to current year 221 1,758 80 Additions based on tax positions related to prior year 458 4 366 Reductions from settlements and statute of limitation expiration (2,179 ) (2,247 ) (299 ) Effect of foreign currency translation (168 ) 529 (104 ) Balance at end of year $ 2,854 $ 4,522 $ 4,486 The Company classifies income tax-related penalties and net interest as income tax expense. In the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 income tax related interest and penalties were insignificant. The Company believes that it is reasonably possible that there may be a decrease to its unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months due to audit settlements and statute expirations, but the amount expected to reverse is insignificant in relation to the consolidated financial statements. Note 5 — Debt Credit Agreement The Company, together with certain direct and indirect subsidiaries, have an outstanding credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with a consortium of lenders and Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent. The Credit Agreement provides the Company a revolving credit note (“U.S. Revolving Note”) with a maximum borrowing capacity of $350,000. All subsidiary borrowers and guarantors participating in the Credit Agreement have entered into a related pledge and security agreement. The security agreement grants a security interest to the lenders in substantially all of the personal property of subsidiaries designated as borrowers to secure their respective obligations under the Credit Agreement, including stock and membership interest of specified subsidiaries (limited to 66% of the stock in case of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries). The Credit Agreement restricts the amount of dividend payments the Company can make to shareholders. The Credit Agreement requires the Company to maintain a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio and a Consolidated Leverage Ratio. Definitions for these financial ratios are provided in the Credit Agreement. Under the Credit Agreement, U.S. Dollar denominated loans bear interest at either a base rate (“Base Rate Loans”) or Eurocurrency rate (“Eurocurrency Rate Loans”), plus a margin (“Applicable Rate”). The base rate is equal to the highest of the Federal Funds Rate (2.40% at December 31, 2018) plus 0.50%, Bank of America’s prime rate (5.50% at December 31, 2018), or a one month Eurocurrency rate (0.00% at December 31, 2018) plus 1.00%. The Eurocurrency rate for loans denominated in U.S. Dollars is equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate (2.50% at December 31, 2018). All loans denominated in a currency other than the U.S. Dollar must be Eurocurrency Rate Loans. Interest is payable at least quarterly. The Applicable Rate varies based on the Consolidated Leverage Ratio reported by the Company. As long as the Company is not in default of the terms and conditions of the Credit Agreement, the lowest and highest possible Applicable Rate is 1.25% and 2.00%, respectively, for Eurocurrency Rate Loans and 0.25% and 1.00%, respectively, for Base Rate Loans. The Company also has two fixed interest rate loans with the German Investment Corporation (“DEG”), a subsidiary of KfW banking group, a German government-owned development bank.

Under the terms of the DEG China Loan, the Company must maintain a minimum Debt-to-Equity Ratio, Current Ratio and Debt Service Coverage Ratio, as defined by the DEG China Loan agreement, based on the financial statements of Gentherm’s wholly owned subsidiary, Gentherm Automotive Systems (China) Ltd. DEG Vietnam Loan The Company’s second fixed interest rate senior loan agreement with DEG was used to finance the construction and set up of the Vietnam production facility (“DEG Vietnam Loan”). The DEG Vietnam Loan is subject to semi-annual principal payments that began November, 2017 and will end May, 2023. Under the terms of the DEG Vietnam Loan, the Company must maintain a minimum Currency Ratio, Equity Ratio and Enhanced Equity Ratio, as defined by the DEG Vietnam Loan agreement, based on the financial statements of Gentherm’s wholly owned subsidiary, Gentherm Vietnam Co. Ltd. As of December 31, 2018, we were in compliance with all terms as outlined in the Credit Agreement, DEG China Loan and DEG Vietnam Loan. Undrawn borrowing capacity under the U.S. Revolving Note was $221,871 as of December 31, 2018. The following table summarizes the Company’s debt at December 31, 2018.

On May 19, 2017 the 2013 Plan was amended, increasing the amount of available shares by 2,000,000. The 2013 Plan permits the granting of various awards including stock options (including both nonqualified options and incentive options), stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock and restricted stock units, performance shares and certain other awards to employees, outside directors and consultants and advisors of the Company. All shares of our Common Stock that remained available for issuance under the Amended and Restated 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2006 Plan”) and the Gentherm Incorporated 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2011 Plan), were reduced to zero; however, some options under the 2006 Plan are still outstanding. As of December 31, 2018, the Company had an aggregate of 1,567,594 shares of Common Stock available to issue under the 2013 Plan. All plans are administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board. The selection of participants, allotment of shares, determination of price and other conditions are determined by the Compensation Committee at its sole discretion, in order to attract and retain personnel instrumental to the success of the Company. Stock options, for example, granted under such plans have lives for a period of up to ten years from the date of grant at an exercise price which is not less than the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of the grant. During the three year period ended December 31, 2018, the Company has outstanding stock options, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”), restricted stock awards and restricted stock units to employees, directors and consultants. These awards become available to the recipient upon the satisfaction of a vesting condition, either based on a period of service or based on the performance of a specific achievement. For equity based awards with a service condition, the requisite service period typically ranges between three to five years for employees and consultants and one year for directors. As of December 31, 2018, there were 129,577 performance based restricted stock units outstanding. These awards vest over a three-year period after the Company’s achievement of either a target return on invested capital ratio (“ROIC”), as defined in the award agreement, for a specified fiscal year, or the Company’s common stock market price returning a target total shareholder return (“TSR”), as defined, during a specific three-year measurement period. Approximately one-half of the performance based restricted stock units are paid based on the ROIC condition, while the other one-half are paid based on the TSR condition. In each case, awards will pay out 50% of the target number of shares for achieving a minimum threshold or up to 200% of the target number of shares for exceeding the target. All other outstanding, unvested equity-based awards were service based. Equity-based award vesting may be accelerated at the discretion of the Board. Total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested options, restricted stock and SARs outstanding under all of the Company’s equity plans was $15,932 and $18,593 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of two years. Compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $12,177, $12,727 and $8,147, respectively. No share-based payment arrangements expired during the three-year period ended December 31, 2018. If Gentherm were to realize expired shared-based payment arrangements, they would be reported as a forfeit in the activity roll forward tables below.

This model incorporates certain assumptions for inputs including a risk-free interest rate, expected dividend yield of the underlying Common Stock, expected option life and expected volatility in the market value of the underlying Common Stock. The following assumptions were used for options issued in the following periods: 2018 2017 2016 Expected volatility NA 33% 37% Weighted average expected volatility NA 33% 37% Expected lives NA 3 yrs. 3 yrs. Risk-free interest rate NA 1.49-1.93% 0.90-1.07% Expected dividend yield none none none NA – No new stock options were granted during 2018. Expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of the Company’s Common Stock. The Company uses historical exercise data and several other factors in developing an assumption for the expected lives of stock options, including the average holding period of outstanding options and their remaining terms. The risk-free interest rate is based upon quoted market yields for United States Treasury debt securities. The expected dividend yield is based upon the Company’s history of having never issued a dividend, the limitations to issue a dividend under terms of the Credit Agreement and management’s current expectation regarding future dividends. We do not expect any of the options granted to be forfeited for purposes of computing fair value.

Note 9 — Segment Reporting Segment information is used by management for making operating decisions for the Company. Management evaluates the performance of the Company’s segments based primarily on operating income or loss. As discussed in Note 17, Gentherm acquired Etratech on November 1, 2017. The acquisition enhances key elements of our business strategy by greatly expanding our knowledge and capability to produce in-house electronic components for next generation intelligent thermal management products. The Company’s reportable segments are as follows: • Automotive — this segment represents the design, development, manufacturing and sales of automotive climate comfort solutions, battery sub-systems, specialized automotive cable systems and automotive thermal convenience products. All of our activities with respect to electronics are also included in our Automotive segment because a majority of these activities relate to the manufacture of electronic components for our automotive products or the automotive products of third parties. Etratech’s operating results are included within Gentherm’s Automotive segment due to the concentration of Etratech’s product applications within the automotive, recreational vehicle and marine industries. • Industrial — the combined operating results of GPT, CSZ and Gentherm’s advanced research and development division. We perform advanced research and development on thermal management systems, including those that utilize new proprietary comfort software algorithms, to enhance the efficiency and functionality of our automotive heating and cooling products.

The Company’s former Chief Executive Officer, Daniel R. Coker, is the only participant in the Plan. On May 10, 2017 the Company amended (the “Plan Amendment”) the Plan. Prior to the Plan Amendment, the Plan provided for 15 annual retirement benefit payments of $300,000 each beginning January 1, 2018. Mr. Coker became fully vested in the benefits under the Benefit Plan on April 1, 2017. The Plan Amendment provided that if Mr. Coker continued to provide employment service to the Company through and including January 1, 2018, the fifteen annual retirement benefit payments would be increased to $342,000, otherwise the 15 annual retirement benefits would remain at $300,000. On June 28, 2017, the same day a leader transition plan leading up to Mr. Coker’s retirement was announced, the Company entered into a Retirement Agreement with Mr. Coker (the “Retirement Agreement”). The Retirement Agreement provided that if Mr. Coker’s retirement date was prior to January 1, 2018, the Company would amend the terms of the Plan, as amended, to accelerate the in-service vesting date to ensure an increase in the annual accrued benefit from $300,000 to $342,000. Mr. Coker became fully vested in the incremental benefit, as described in the Plan Amendment, on December 4, 2017. F-34 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Note 10 — Pension and Other Post Retiremen t Benefit Plans – (Continued) The Company records a projected benefit obligation representing the present value of future plan benefits when earned by the participant. The following table sets forth the benefit obligation, amounts recognized in the Company’s financial statements and the principal assumptions used: 2018 2017 Change in projected benefit obligation: Benefit obligation at beginning of year $ 4,218 $ 3,419 Service cost — 101 Interest cost 114 111 Actuarial (gain) loss (158 ) 78 Prior service cost (342 ) 509 Benefit obligation at end of year $ 3,832 $ 4,218 The portion of the benefit obligation from the Plan expected to be paid in 2019 is classified as a current liability within accrued liabilities in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. The remaining portion is classified as a non-current liability within pension benefit obligations. Service and interest cost is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of income and actuarial gains and losses are included the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as part of accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders’ equity. Actuarial gains or losses are amortized to selling, general and administrative expense in the Company’s consolidated statements of income based on the average future service life of the Plan using the corridor method. A discount rate assumption of 3.65%, 2.95% and 3.25% was used to determine the benefit obligation for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. A discount rate assumption of 2.95%, 3.25% and 3.40% was used to determine the net periodic service cost for years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Prior service costs reflect an increase to the projected benefit obligation as a result of the Plan Amendment, which retroactively increased benefits. Prior service cost is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of income. We do not expect contributions to be paid to the Plan during the next fiscal year. Although the Plan is not funded, the Company has established a separate trust having the sole purpose of paying benefits under the Plan. The only asset of the trust is a corporate-owned life insurance policy (“COLI”). The COLI is valued at fair value using quoted prices listed in active markets (Level 1 input based on the U.S. GAAP fair value hierarchy). The policy value of the COLI was $2,148 and $2,353 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively, and was included in other non-current assets. Components of the Plan’s net periodic pension benefit cost for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are as follows: 2018 2017 2016 Service cost $ — $ 101 $ 387 Interest cost 114 111 98 Amortization of prior service cost — 509 — Net periodic benefit cost $ 114 $ 721 $ 485 F-35 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Note 10 — Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefit Plans – (Continued) Pretax amounts recognized in other comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are as follows 2018 2017 2016 Actuarial Losses/(gains) $ (158 ) $ 78 $ 36 Amortization of actuarial losses — — — Establish prior service cost — 509 — Amortization prior service cost — (509 ) — $ (158 ) $ 78 $ 36 Tax expense of $73 was recognized in other comprehensive income related to the Plan for the year ended December 31, 2018, which included $40 due to the adoption of ASU 2018-02. See Note 13 for additional information about ASU 2018-02 and its impact in to Gentherm’s financial statements. Tax benefit of $26 was recognized in other comprehensive income related to the Plan for the year ended December 31, 2017. Tax expense of $14 was recognized in other comprehensive income related to the Plan for the year ended December 31, 2016. Pretax unrecognized actuarial losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss not yet recognized in net periodic benefit cost were $222 and $380 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. No amount of pretax unrecognized actuarial loss recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 31, 2018 are expected to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost in the year ending December 31, 2019. Gentherm GmbH has an established defined benefit plan for retired and current members of its executive management team. Gentherm GmbH records a projected benefit obligation representing the present value of future plan benefits when earned by the participant.

Pretax amounts recognized in other comprehensive (loss) income for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are as follows: 2018 2017 2016 Actuarial (gains)/losses $ 143 $ (229 ) $ 718 Amortization of actuarial losses (73 ) (78 ) (48 ) Amortization of prior service cost — — — $ 70 $ (307 ) $ 670 Tax expense of $19 was recognized in other comprehensive income related to the Gentherm GmbH defined benefit plan for the year ended December 31, 2018. Tax expense of $86 and tax benefit of $171 were recognized in other comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Pretax unrecognized actuarial losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss not yet recognized in net periodic benefit cost were $2,372 and $2,416 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. We expect $74 of pretax unrecognized actuarial loss recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 31, 2018 to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost in the year ending December 31, 2019. Components of the Plan’s net periodic pension benefit cost for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are as follows: 2018 2017 2016 Interest cost $ 147 $ 130 $ 154 Return on plan assets (130 ) (121 ) (125 ) Amortization of prior service cost — — — Amortization of actuarial loss (gains) 73 78 48 Net periodic benefit cost $ 90 $ 87 $ 77 The Gentherm GmbH defined benefit plan is underfunded by $3,720 and $4,036 as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The net periodic benefit cost is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Company’s consolidated statements of income and actuarial gains and losses are included the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as part of accumulated other comprehensive income within shareholders’ equity. Actuarial gains or losses are amortized to selling, general and administrative expense in the Company’s consolidated statements of income using the corridor method. The following table describes the actuarial assumptions used to determine the benefit obligation and the net periodic service cost: 2018 2017 2016 Discount rate 2.04 % 1.93 % 1.69 % Expected long term rate of return on plan assets 3.40 % 3.40 % 3.40 % F-37 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Note 10 — Pension and Other Post Retirement Benefit Plans – (Continued) Plan assets are comprised of Gentherm GmbH’s pension insurance policies and are pledged to the beneficiaries of the plan. A market valuation technique, based on observable underlying insurance charges, is used to determine the fair value of the pension plan assets (Level 2). The expected return on plan assets assumption used to calculate Gentherm GmbH’s pension benefit obligation was determined using actual returns realized on plan assets in the prior year. We do not expect contributions to be paid to the Gentherm GmbH defined benefit plan during the next fiscal year. The schedule of expected pension payments made to Gentherm GmbH defined benefit plan participants over the next 10 years is as follows: Year 2019 $ 287 2020 285 2021 283 2022 279 2023 290 2024 - 2028 1,344 Total $ 2,768 Gentherm has adopted a 401(k) plan to provide all eligible employees a means to accumulate retirement savings on a tax-advantaged basis, and eligible executive officers can participate in this plan on the same basis as other participants. Participants may defer specified portions of their compensation. On a discretionary basis, the Company matches a portion of the employee contributions. The Plan also allows for additional discretionary contributions. Gentherm made $1,471, $1,396 and $1,289 in matching contributions to the 401(k) plan in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. On December 31, 2018, Gentherm adopted the Gentherm Incorporated Deferred Compensation Plan (the “Management Plan”), effective January 1, 2019. The Management Plan’s purpose is to attract and retain a select group of management or highly compensated employees who will contribute significantly to the future business success of the Company by providing supplemental retirement income benefits. No contributions were made to the Management Plan as of December 31, 2018. Note 11 — Fair Value Measurement The Company bases fair value on the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We have adopted a fair value hierarchy to measure fair value into three broad levels, which are described below: Level 1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for assets or liabilities. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to Level 1 inputs. Level 2: Inputs, other than quoted market prices included in Level 1, that are observable either directly or indirectly for the asset or liability Level 3: Unobservable inputs are used when little or no market data is available. The fair value hierarchy gives the lowest priority to Level 3 inputs. In determining fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible and also considers counterparty credit risk in its assessment of fair value. F-38 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Note 11 — Fair Value Measurement – (Continued) Except for derivative instruments (see Note 12), pension liabilities, pension plan assets and a corporate owned life insurance policy (see Note 10), and assets and liabilities held for sale (see Note 15), the Company has no financial assets and liabilities that are carried at fair value at December 31, 2018 and 2017. The carrying amounts of financial instruments comprising cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to the relatively short maturity of such instruments. The Company uses an income valuation technique to measure the fair values of its debt instruments by converting amounts of future cash flows to a single present value amount using rates based on current market expectations (Level 2 inputs). As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the carrying values of the Company’s Credit Agreement indebtedness were not materially different than their estimated fair values because the interest rates on variable rate debt approximated rates currently available to the Company (see Note 5). Discount rates used to measure the fair value of Gentherm’s DEG Vietnam Loan and DEG China Loan are based on quoted swap rates. As of December 31, 2018, the carrying values of the DEG Vietnam Loan and DEG China Loan were $11,250 and $913, respectively, as compared to an estimated fair value of $11,100 and $900, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, the carrying value of the DEG Vietnam Loan and DEG China Loan were $13,750 and $1,919, as compared to an estimated fair value of $13,600 and $2,000, respectively. Certain Company assets are required to be recorded at fair value on a non-recurring basis when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. See Note 15 for information regarding impairment losses recognized on assets and liabilities classified as held for sale in 2018. As of December 31, 2017, the Company did not realize any changes to the fair value of these assets due to the non-occurrence of events or circumstances that could negatively impact their recoverability. Note 12 — Derivative Financial Instruments We are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, short-term interest rates and price fluctuations of certain material commodities such as copper. Market risks for changes in interest rates relate primarily to our debt obligations under our Amended Credit Agreement. Foreign currency exchange risks are attributable to sales to foreign customers and purchases from foreign suppliers not denominated in a location’s functional currency, foreign plant operations, intercompany indebtedness, intercompany investments and include exposures to the European Euro, Mexican Peso, Canadian Dollar, Hungarian Forint, Macedonian Denar, Ukrainian Hryvnia, Japanese Yen, Chinese Renminbi, Korean Won and Vietnamese Dong. The Company regularly enters into derivative contracts with the objective of managing its financial and operational exposure arising from these risks by offsetting gains and losses on the underlying exposures with gains and losses on the financial instruments used to hedge them. The maximum length of time over which we hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange risks is one year. We had foreign currency derivative contracts with a notional value of $33,250 and $29,273 outstanding at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The maximum length of time over which we hedge our exposure to price fluctuations in material commodities is two years. We had copper commodity swap contracts with a notional value of $0 and $404 outstanding at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. F-39 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Note 12 — Derivative Financial Instrume nts – (Continued) We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes. Our hedging relationships are formally documented at the inception of the hedge, and hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to future cash flows on hedged transactions both at the inception of a hedge and on an ongoing basis to be designated for hedge accounting treatment. For derivative contracts which can be classified as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the change in the fair value of the derivative is recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheet. When the underlying hedge transaction is realized, the gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive loss is recorded in earnings in the consolidated statement of income on the same line as the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk. We record the ineffective portion of foreign currency hedging instruments, if any, to foreign currency gain (loss) in the consolidated statements of income. See Note 14 for the amount of unrealized loss associated with foreign currency derivatives and copper commodity derivatives reported in accumulated other comprehensive income as of December 31, 2017 that was reclassified into earnings during 2018. Though we continuously monitor the hedging program, derivative positions and hedging strategies, foreign currency forward exchange agreements have not always been designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. The Company uses an income approach to value derivative instruments, analyzing quoted market prices to calculate the forward values and then discounts such forward values to the present value using benchmark rates at commonly quoted intervals for the instrument’s full term. Information related to the recurring fair value measurement of derivative financial instruments in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018 is as follows: Asset Derivatives Liability Derivatives Net Asset/ (Liabilities) Hedge Designation Fair Value Hierarchy Balance Sheet Location Fair Value Balance Sheet Location Fair Value Foreign currency derivatives Cash flow hedge Level 2 Current assets $ 92 Current liabilities $ — $ 92 Information related to the recurring fair value measurement of derivative financial instruments in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2017 is as follows: Asset Derivatives Liability Derivatives Net Asset/ (Liabilities) Hedge Designation Fair Value Hierarchy Balance Sheet Location Fair Value Balance Sheet Location Fair Value Foreign currency derivatives Cash flow hedge Level 2 Current assets $ 141 Current liabilities $ (1,050 ) $ (909 ) Commodity derivatives Cash flow hedge Level 2 Current assets $ 72 $ 72 F-40 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Note 12 — Derivative Financial Instruments – (Continued) Information related to the effect of derivative instrument`s on our consolidated statements of income is as follows: Location Year Ended December 31, 2018 Year Ended December 31, 2017 Foreign currency derivatives Product Revenues $ — $ (3 ) Cost of sales (444 ) 2,209 Selling, general and administrative 75 (216 ) Other comprehensive income 1,096 302 Foreign currency gain 50 (112 ) Total foreign currency derivatives $ 777 $ 2,180 Commodity derivatives Cost of sales $ 145 $ 202 Other comprehensive (loss) income $ (218 ) $ 54 Total commodity derivatives $ (73 ) $ 256 We did not incur any hedge ineffectiveness during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. Note 13 — New Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Revenue from Contracts with Customers In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers.” ASU 2014-09 was developed to enable financial statement users to better understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. The update’s core principal is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those good or services. Issuers are to use a five-step contract review model to ensure revenue is measured, recognized, and disclosed in accordance with this principle. The FASB issued several amendments to the update, including a one-year deferral of the original effective date, and new methods for identifying performance obligations that are intended to reduce the cost and complexity of compliance. We adopted ASU 2014-09 and related amendments effective January 1, 2018 using the cumulative catch-up transition method, which required us to disclose the cumulative effect of initially applying the update recognized at the date of initial application. We elected to apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to contracts that were not completed at January 1, 2018. The most significant impact from adoption of ASU 2014-09 occurred within our Automotive segment and relates to our accounting for production part purchase options that grant customers a material right to purchase additional parts under long-term supply agreements in the future. Due to the complexity of certain of our automotive supply contracts, the actual revenue recognition treatment for customer purchase options will depend on contract-specific terms and could vary from other contracts that are similar in nature. Revenue recognition related to goods and services reported in the Industrial segment remains substantially unchanged. F-41 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Note 13 – New Accounting Pronouncements – ( Continued ) The amount by which each financial statement line item was affected by application of ASU 2014-09 and related amendments during 2018 is as follows: Revenue Based on Previously Effective Guidance New Revenue Standard Adjustment Revenue Based on New Revenue Standard Year Ended December 31, 2018 Product revenues $ 1,035,773 $ 2,486 $ 1,038,259 Income tax expense 16,727 507 16,220 Net income 39,920 1,979 41,899 Basic earnings per share 1.11 0.06 1.17 Diluted earnings per share 1.10 0.06 1.16 Revenue Based on Previously Effective Guidance New Revenue Standard Adjustment Revenue Based on New Revenue Standard Balance Sheet December 31, 2018 Accounts receivable, net of allowance for doubtful accounts $ 166,858 $ — $ 166,858 Accrued liabilities (a) $ 64,211 $ 1,597 $ 65,808 Unearned revenue (a) $ — $ 1,597 $ 1,597 Deferred income taxes, net $ 62,522 $ 325 $ 62,847 Accumulated earnings $ 365,237 $ (1,272 ) $ 363,965 a) During 2018, unearned revenues associated with GPT and CSZ-IC were classified as liabilities held for sale. As of December 31, 2018, 5,351 in unearned revenues associated with GPT and CSZ-IC were classified as liabilities held for sale. Adoption of ASU 2014-09 and related amendments had no impact to cash from or used in operating, investing or financing activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows. Statement of Cash Flows In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-15, “Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments.” ASU 2016-15 provides guidance on the classification of eight specific cash receipt and cash payment transactions in the statement of cash flows. The Company focused its evaluation on the following transactions to determine the effect ASU 2016-15 will have on the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows: 1) Debt extinguishment payments and debt prepayments are to be shown as cash outflows for financing activities. Previously, Gentherm classified debt extinguishment payments within operating activities. 2) Payments made to settle contingent consideration liabilities not made soon after the acquisition date of a business combination should be recognized as cash outflows for financing activities up to the amount of the liability recognized at the acquisition date. Payments, or the portion of a payment, to settle contingent consideration liabilities that exceed the amount of the liability recognized at the acquisition date will be recognized as cash outflows for operating activities. 3) Cash receipts from the settlement of insurance claims, excluding those related to corporate-owned life insurance policies shall be classified on the basis of the related insurance coverage. For example, proceeds received to cover claims issued under product recall liability insurance would be classified as cash inflows from operating activities. 4) Cash receipts from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies shall be classified as cash inflows from investing activities. F-42 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Note 13 – New Accounting Pronouncements – ( Continued ) We have adopted ASU 2016-15 and related amendments effective January 1, 2018. None of the cash receipt and cash payment transactions addressed by the update occurred during any of the periods presented in this report. Adoption of this update and related amendments did not have a material impact on the cash flows of the Company. Income Taxes In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory.” ASU 2016-16 modifies the current prohibition to recognize deferred income taxes from differences between the tax basis of assets in the buyer’s tax jurisdiction and their cost resulting from an intra-entity transfer from one tax-paying component to another tax-paying component of the same consolidated group. Under current GAAP, deferred income taxes for intra-entity asset transfers are not recognized until the asset is sold to an outside party. ASU 2016-16 allows entities to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs. We adopted ASU 2016-16 and related amendments effective January 1, 2018 on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment directly to retained earnings as of such adoption date. As a result of the amendments in ASU 2016-16, a favorable adjustment of $31,645 was recorded directly to retained earnings. The new deferred tax assets will be recognized ratably over the useful life of the applicable assets. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, “Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income.” ASU 2018-02 provides a remedy to a narrow-scope financial reporting issue created by the Tax Act. The Tax Act required entities to adjust deferred tax assets and liabilities to reflect the impact from newly enacted lower corporate income tax rates and recognize the effect in income from continuing operations. This requirement applied to all deferred tax assets and liabilities, even those which arose from transactions originally recognized in other comprehensive income. The amendments in ASU 2018-02 allow adjustments to deferred tax assets and liabilities due to newly enacted lower corporate income tax rates to be recognized in retained earnings, if those deferred tax balances arose from transactions originally recognized in other comprehensive income. Income tax effects are released from accumulated other comprehensive income and recorded against the deferred tax balance in the consolidated balance sheet when the underlying activity is realized. ASU 2018-02 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption of the amendments in this update is permitted, including adoption in any interim period for which financial statements have not yet been issued. The amendments in ASU 2018-02 must be applied in the period of adoption or retrospectively to each period in which the effect of the change in U.S. federal corporate income tax rate in the Tax Act is recognized. We elected to early adopt ASU 2018-02 and related amendments effective January 1, 2018. An adjustment of $40 was recognized against retained earnings for effect of the change in the federal corporate income tax rate on deferred tax amounts. There are no related adjustments to the Company’s valuation allowance and no other income tax effects from the Tax Act on balances that remain in accumulated other comprehensive income were reclassified. Tax Act In January 2018, the FASB released guidance on the accounting for tax on the global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) provisions of the Tax Act. The GILTI provisions impose a tax on foreign income in excess of deemed return on tangible assets of foreign corporations. During the first quarter of 2018, the Company elected to treat any potential GILTI inclusions as a period cost. F-43 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Note 13 – New Accounting Pronouncements – ( Continued ) Goodwill Impairment In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, “Intangibles – Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.” ASU 2017-04 modified the concept of impairment of goodwill to be a condition that exists when the carrying value of a reporting unit that includes goodwill exceeds its fair value. An entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Entities no longer will determine goodwill impairment by calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by assigning the fair value of a reporting unit to all of its assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination. ASU 2017-04 is effective for annual and any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption of the amendments in this update is permitted. The amendments in ASU 2017-04 must be applied on a prospective basis and in the initial period of adoption, entities must disclose the nature of and reason for the change in accounting principle. The Company has adopted the accounting principles in ASU 2017-04 and applied them to our test for goodwill impairment. See Note 15 for information about the goodwill impairment loss recognized during 2018. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted Derivatives and Hedging In October 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-16, “Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Inclusion of the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) Overnight Index Swap (OIS) Rate as a Benchmark Interest Rate for Hedge Accounting Purposes.” ASU 2018-16 adds the OIS Rate based on SOFR to the list of eligible benchmark interest rates that can be used for hedge accounting purposes under Topic 815. SOFR is a volume-weighted median interest rate that is calculated daily based on overnight transactions from the prior day’s trading activity in specified segments of the U.S. Treasury repo market. The designation of the OIS rate based on SOFR as a benchmark interest rate for hedge accounting purposes is in response to ongoing concerns about the sustainability of LIBOR and the Federal Reserve’s intent to have a suitable alternative to USD LIBOR that is more firmly based on actual transactions in a robust market. Prior to this update, the only eligible benchmark interest rates were the interest rates on direct Treasury obligations of the U.S. government (UST), the LIBOR swap rate, the OIS Rate based on the Fed Funds Effective Rate and the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) Municipal Swap Rate. ASU 2018-16 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption of the amendments in this update is permitted. The amendments in this update should be adopted on a prospective basis for qualifying new or redesigned hedging relationships entered into on or after the date of adoption. While the Company has not executed any U.S. benchmark interest rate transactions in order to apply hedge accounting under Topic 815, we are currently in the process of determining the impact implementation of ASU 2018-16 will have on our strategy approach to the management of interest rate risk. Cloud Computing Arrangements That Are Service Contracts In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, “Intangibles – Goodwill and Other – Internal-Use Software (Subtopic 350-40): Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract.” ASU 2018-15 provides guidance on when costs incurred to implement a hosting arrangement that is a service contract are and are not capitalized, aligning with the guidance for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. Entities must first determine the project stage of the implementation activity; depending on their nature, costs for implementation activities in the application development stage are capitalized and costs incurred during the preliminary project and post-implementation stages are expensed as the activities are performed. Capitalized implementation costs should be amortized over the term of the hosting arrangement on a straight-line basis and presented in the same line items in the consolidated statement of income as the expense for fees for the associated hosting arrangements. Similarly, capitalized implementation costs should be presented in same line item in the balance sheet as prepaid fees for the associated hosting arrangement and cash flows from capitalized implementation costs should be classified in the same manner as cash flows for the fees for the associated hosting arrangement. F-44 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Note 13 – New Accounting Pronouncements – ( Continued ) ASU 2018-15 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption of the amendments in this update is permitted, including adoption in any interim period for which financial statements have not yet been issued. ASU 2018-15 permits two methods of adoption: prospectively to costs for activities performed on or after the date the entity first applies the content from the update, or retrospectively to all periods presented. We are currently in the process of determining the impact implementation of ASU 2018-15 will have on the Company’s financial statement note disclosures. Retirement Benefits In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-14, “Compensation – Retirement Benefits – Defined Benefit Plans – General (Subtopic 715-20): Disclosure Framework – Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans.” The amendments in ASU 2018-14 were developed using the concepts incorporated in the FASB’s Concepts Statement, Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting – Chapter 8: Notes to Financial Statements, which were finalized in August 2018. The amendments in this update remove the following disclosure requirements, among others, from Subtopic 715-20: 1) The amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income expected to be recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost over the next fiscal year. 2) The amount and timing of plan assets expected to be returned to the employer. The following disclosure requirements were added to Subtopic 715-20: 1) The weighted-average interest crediting rates for cash balance plans and other plans with promised interest crediting rates. 2) An explanation of the reasons for significant gains and losses related to changes in the benefit obligation for the period. ASU 2018-14 is effective for annual periods ending after December 15, 2020. Early adoption of the amendments in this update are permitted. Entities should apply the amendments in this update on a retrospective basis to all periods presented. We are currently in the process of determining the impact implementation of ASU 2018-14 will have on the Company’s financial statement note disclosures. Fair Value Measurement In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820): Disclosure Framework – Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement.” The amendments in ASU 2018-13 were developed using the concepts incorporated in the FASBs Concepts Statement, Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting – Chapter 8: Notes to Financial Statements, which were finalized in August 2018. The amendments in this update remove the following disclosure requirements from Topic 820: 1) The amount of and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. 2) The policy for timing of transfer between levels. 3) The valuation processes for Level 3 fair value measurements. The following disclosure requirements were added to Topic 820: 1) The changes in unrealized gains and losses for the period included in other comprehensive income for recurring Level 3 fair value measurements held at the end of the reporting period. 2) The range and weighted average of significant unobservable inputs used to develop Level 3 fair value measurements. F-45 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Note 13 – New Accounting Pronouncements – ( Continued ) ASU 2018-13 is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. Early adoption of disclosures that are removed is permitted, but adoption is delayed for the new additional disclosures until their effective date. The amendments in ASU 2018-13 that provide for new additional disclosure should be applied on a prospective basis, while all other amendments should be applied retrospectively to all periods presented upon their effective date. We are currently in the process of determining the impact implementation of ASU 2018-13 will have on the Company’s financial statement note disclosures. Leases In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842).” ASU 2016-02 requires lessees to recognize on their balance sheet a liability to make lease payments and a right-of-use asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term. Payments to be made in optional periods should be included in the measurement of lease assets and liabilities if the lessee is reasonably certain it will exercise an option to extend the lease or not exercise an option to terminate the lease. While ASU 2016-02 continues to differentiate between finance or capital leases and operating leases, the principal change from current lease accounting guidance is that lease assets and liabilities arising from operating leases will be recognized on the balance sheet. ASU 2016-02 is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption of the amendments in this update are permitted. The FASB has issued several amendments to ASU 2016-02, including ASU 2018-11, “Leases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements” that introduced an additional transition method permitting an entity to initially apply the new lease standard at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. We expect elect this transition method. ASU 2016-02 includes optional practical expedients intended to reduce the cost and complexity to implement the new lease standard, such as an option to maintain the current lease classification for all existing lease arrangements and the option to use hindsight in evaluating lessee options to extend or terminate a lease. We expect to elect these practical expedients. The Company expects to add right-of-use assets and the corresponding liabilities to the consolidated balance sheet equal to approximately 1.5% to 2.5% of total assets as of the implementation date. Any differences between the total carrying value of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities will be recognized as a reduction to the 2019 opening balance in retained earnings.

Note 15 – Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale During 2018, Gentherm determined GPT and CSZ-IC met the held for sale criteria and recorded an impairment on assets held for sale of $2,190 in impairment loss to adjust net book value to fair value less costs to sell. See Note 2 for information about the Company’s held for sale accounting policy, including a description of the criteria necessary for a disposal group to qualify for classification as held for sale. GPT and CSZ-IC did not meet the criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation. F-48 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Note 15 – Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale – ( Continued ) The assets and liabilities of the disposal group classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2018 are as follows: Accounts receivable, less allowance of $96 $ 10,868 Inventory, net 13,925 Prepaid expenses and other assets 263 Property and equipment, net 29,459 Goodwill 6,844 Other intangible assets, net 6,326 Deferred income tax assets 4,204 Other non-current assets — Impairment loss (2,190 ) Total assets held for sale $ 69,699 Accounts payable $ 2,614 Accrued liabilities 10,448 Total liabilities held for sale $ 13,062 Losses before income taxes from GPT and CSZ-IC during 2018, including $2,190 in impairment loss recognized on held for sale assets, $6,151 in impairment loss on goodwill and $3,135 in impairment loss recognized on other intangible assets, were $15,747. Losses before income taxes from GPT and CSZ-IC during 2017 were $1,949. Management’s estimates used to record impairment expense are inherently uncertain and may change in future periods. Note 16 – Unearned Revenue Unearned revenue by segment was as follows: December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Automotive $ 1,597 $ — Industrial — 4,889 Total $ 1,597 $ 4,889 Changes in unearned revenue were as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2018 Balance, beginning of period $ 4,889 Additions to unearned revenue 21,774 Reclassified to revenue (19,677 ) Reclassified to liabilities held for sale (5,351 ) Currency impacts (38 ) Balance, end of period $ 1,597 Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represent contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods. F-49 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Note 17 — Etratech Acquisition Etratech designs, develops, manufactures and sells electronic control modules and control systems to customers across a range of industries, including automotive, recreational vehicles and marine, HVAC systems and medical, amongst others. Each function is part of an integrated, customer-focused process designed to exceed customer expectations for product quality, reliability and cost. Etratech’s global manufacturing footprint will enable us to provide customers with scalable and flexible manufacturing solutions across a variety of application and geographies. Results of operations for Etratech are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements beginning November 1, 2017. Etratech contributed $8,398 in product revenues and a net loss of $510 for the year ended December 31, 2017. Purchase Price Allocation The purchase price of $65,009, net of cash acquired of $670, has been allocated to the values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of November 1, 2017. An appraisal by an independent third party valuation firm was completed to assist management in determining the fair value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities, including identifiable intangible assets. The fair values of acquired assets and assumed liabilities were determined using the cost approach that relied primarily internal sources of data to make assumptions that are not observable in the market (Level 3 inputs). The purchase price allocation was finalized during the first quarter of 2018. The allocation as of November 1, 2017 was as follows: Accounts receivable $ 12,654 Inventory 7,014 Prepaid expenses and other assets 535 Property and equipment 6,205 Customer relationships 24,774 Technology 8,588 Goodwill 14,881 Assumed liabilities (9,642 ) Net assets acquired 65,009 Cash acquired 670 Purchase price $ 65,679 The gross contractual amount due of accounts receivable is $12,654, all of which was subsequently collected. Supplemental Pro Forma Information The unaudited pro forma combined historical results including the amounts of Etratech revenue and earnings that would have been included in the Company’s consolidated statements of income had the acquisition date been January 1, 2017 or January 1, 2016 are as follows: Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Product revenues $ 1,032,273 $ 966,355 Net income $ 35,911 $ 77,577 Basic earnings per share $ 0.98 $ 2.13 Diluted earnings per share $ 0.98 $ 2.12 The pro forma information includes adjustments for the effect of the amortization of intangible assets recognized in the acquisition. This pro forma information is not indicative of future operating results. F-50 GENTHERM INCORPORATED NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued) (In thousands, except share and per share data) Note 17 – Etratech Acquisition – (Continued) Goodwill We recorded goodwill of approximately $14,881 arising from the acquisition. The acquired goodwill represents intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition. It is estimated that approximately $8,787 of the goodwill recognized will not be deductible for income tax purposes. Intangible Assets In conjunction with the acquisition, intangible assets of $33,362 were recorded. The Company’s estimate of the fair value of these assets at the time of the acquisition was determined with the assistance of an independent third-party valuation firm. As part of the estimated valuation, an estimated useful life for the assets was determined. Intangible assets, net consisted of the following: December 31, 2017 Gross Value Accumulated Amortization Net Value Useful Life Customer relationships $ 24,774 $ 358 $ 24,416 8 -12 yrs Technology 8,588 277 8,311 5 -6 yrs Total $ 33,362 $ 635 $ 32,727 Amortization expense of $635 for the period November 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017 was recorded as follows: Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 Product revenues $ 358 $ 358 Research and development expenses 277 277 Amortization expense for the prospective five years is as follows: 2018 $ 3,769 2019 $ 3,769 2020 $ 3,769 2021 $ 3,706 2022 $ 3,278 Property, Plant & Equipment Property and equipment consist of the following: Asset category Useful life Amount Leasehold improvements 10 yrs $ 342 Machinery and equipment 4-11 yrs 5,248 Furniture and fittings 4 yrs 230 Motor Vehicles 3 yrs 25 Computer hardware and software 1 yrs 360 $ 6,205 F-51 GENTHERM INCORPORATED SCHEDULE II — VALUATION AND QUALIFYING ACCOUNTS For the Years Ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 (In thousands) Description Balance at Beginning of Period Charged to Costs and Expenses Charged to Other Accounts Deductions from Reserves Balance at End of Period Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Year Ended December 31, 2016 955 1,469 (270 ) (763 ) 1,391 Year Ended December 31, 2017 1,391 1,239 51 (1,708 ) 973 Year Ended December 31, 2018 973 1,005 (121 ) (1,006 ) 851 Allowance for Deferred Income Tax Assets Year Ended December 31, 2016 13,418 5,706 180 — 19,304 Year Ended December 31, 2017 19,304 6,700 1,574 — 27,578 Year Ended December 31, 2018 27,578 — (14,009 ) (3,592 ) 9,977 Reserve for Inventory Year Ended December 31, 2016 4,308 876 (68 ) (326 ) 4,790 Year Ended December 31, 2017 4,790 3,521 302 (726 ) 7,887 Year Ended December 31, 2018 7,887 2,712 (1,047 ) (3,282 ) 6,270 F-52 SIGNATURES Pursuant to the requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has duly caused this Report to be signed on its behalf by the undersigned, thereunto duly authorized.

PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS. General Overview McGrath RentCorp (the “Company”) is a California corporation organized in 1979 with corporate offices located in Livermore, California. The Company’s common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “MGRC”. References in this report to the “Company”, “we”, “us”, and “ours” refer to McGrath RentCorp and its subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise. The Company is a diversified business-to-business rental company with four rental divisions: relocatable modular buildings, portable storage containers, electronic test equipment, and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes. Although the Company’s primary emphasis is on equipment rentals, sales of equipment occur in the normal course of business. At December 31, 2022, the Company was comprised of four reportable business segments: (1) its modular building and portable storage segment (“Mobile Modular”); (2) its electronic test equipment segment (“TRS-RenTelco”); (3) its containment solutions for the storage of hazardous and non-hazardous liquids and solids segment (“Adler Tanks”); and (4) its classroom manufacturing business selling modular buildings used primarily as classrooms in California (“Enviroplex”). On February 1, 2023, the Company sold the Adler Tanks business to Ironclad Environmental Solutions, Inc., a Kinderhook portfolio company, for a cash sale price of $265 million, subject to certain adjustments. On the same date, the Company acquired Vesta Housing Solutions Holdings, Inc. (""Vesta Modular""), a portfolio company of Kinderhook Industries, that is a leading provider of temporary and permanent modular space solutions, for a cash purchase price of $400 million, subject to certain adjustments. Business Model The Company invests capital in rental products and generally has recovered its original investment through rents less cash operating expenses in a relatively short period of time compared to the product’s rental life. When the Company’s rental products are sold, the proceeds generally have covered a high percentage of the original investment. With these characteristics, a significant base of - 2 - rental assets on rent generates a considerable amount of operating cash flows to support continued rental asset growth. The Company’s rental products have the following characteristics: The Company believes that rental revenue growth from an increasing base of rental assets and improved gross profits on rents are the best measures of the health of each of our rental businesses. Additionally, we believe our business model and results are enhanced by operational leverage that is created from large regional sales and inventory centers for modulars, a single U.S. based sales, inventory and operations facility for electronic test equipment, as well as shared senior management and back-office functions for financing, human resources, insurance, marketing, information technology and operating and accounting systems. Human Capital Management As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 1,218 employees, of whom 133 were primarily administrative and executive personnel, with 705, 166, 134 and 80 in the operations of Mobile Modular, Adler Tanks, TRS-RenTelco and Enviroplex, respectively. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and management believes its relationship with our employees is good. The Company believes its employees are key to its success and it is committed to all of its employees’ engagement, training and career development, and personal and professional growth. The Board of Directors also receives regular updates from senior management on matters relating to the Company’s strategy for the recruitment, retention and development of the Company’s employees. The Company provides training in technical, operational and managerial skills, and places special emphasis on safety, effective communications, customer service, and employee development. Additionally, the Company offers employees a tuition reimbursement program whereby the employee may receive reimbursement for tuition and fees for undergraduate or graduate level academic courses at an accredited two or four year college or university that may help employees improve performance in their current job or prepare them for advancement. Government Regulations We are subject to certain environmental, transportation, anti-corruption, import controls, health and safety, privacy and other laws and regulations in locations in which we operate. Our activity in jurisdictions in which we operate is additionally subject to anti-bribery laws and regulations, such as the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, which prevent companies and their officers, employees and agents from making payments to officials and public entities of foreign countries to facilitate obtaining new contracts. We are also subject to laws and regulations that govern and impose liability for activities that may have adverse environmental effects, including discharges into air and water, and handling and disposal of hazardous substances and waste. Our motor vehicles and related units are subject to regulation in certain states under motor vehicle and similar registrations. While we incur costs in our business to comply with - 3 - these laws and regulations, management does not believe that the costs of compliance with these various governmental regulations is material to our business and financial condition. Available Information We make the Company’s Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filings available at our website www.mgrc.com. These filings include our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Act of 1934, which are available as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company electronically files such material with, or furnishes such material to, the SEC.

Modulars vary from simple single-unit construction site offices to multi-floor modular complexes. The Company’s modular rental fleet includes a full range of styles and sizes. The Company considers its modulars to be among the most attractive and well-designed available. The units are constructed with wood or metal siding, sturdily built and physically capable of a long useful life. Modulars are generally provided with installed heat, air conditioning, lighting, electrical outlets and floor covering, and may have customized interiors including partitioning, cabinetry and plumbing facilities. Mobile Modular purchases new modulars from various manufacturers who build to Mobile Modular’s design specifications. During 2022, Mobile Modular purchased 30% of its modular units from one manufacturer. The Company believes that the loss of any of its primary modular manufacturers could have an adverse effect on its operations since Mobile Modular could experience higher prices and longer lead times for delivery of modular units until other manufacturers were able to increase their production capacity. The Company’s modulars are manufactured to comply with state building codes, have a low risk of obsolescence, and can be modified or reconfigured to accommodate a wide variety of customer needs. Historically, as state building codes have changed over the years, Mobile Modular has been able to continue to use existing modulars, with minimal, if any, required upgrades. The Company has no assurance that it will continue to be able to use existing modular equipment with minimal upgrades as building codes change in the future. Mobile Modular currently operates from regional sales and inventory centers in California, Texas, Florida, Georgia and Virginia, serving large geographic areas in these and surrounding states, and sales offices serving Louisiana, North Carolina and South Carolina. In 2021, the Company purchased substantially all of the assets of Design Space Modular Buildings PNW, LP, which operated from a number of smaller sales and inventory centers across the Western United States. In 2021, the Company completed the purchase of the assets of GRS Holding LLC, DBA Kitchens To Go (“Kitchens To Go”). Kitchens To Go provides interim and permanent modular kitchen solutions serving the United States from its inventory center in Indiana. These sales and inventory centers have in-house infrastructure and operational capabilities to support quick and efficient repair, modification, and refurbishment of equipment for the next rental opportunity. The Company believes operating from large regional sales and inventory centers results in better operating margins as operating costs can be spread over a large installed customer base. Mobile Modular actively maintains and repairs its rental equipment, and management believes this ensures the continued use of the modular product over its long life and, when sold, has resulted in higher sale proceeds relative to its capitalized cost. When rental equipment returns from a customer, the necessary repairs and preventative maintenance are performed prior to its next rental. By making these expenditures for repair and maintenance throughout the equipment’s life we believe that older equipment can generally rent for rates similar to those of newer equipment. Management believes the condition of the equipment is a more significant factor in determining the rental rate and sale price than its age. Over the last three years, used equipment sold each year represented approximately 2% of rental equipment, and has been, on average, 14 years old with sale proceeds above its net book value. On February 1, 2023, the Company acquired Vesta Modular, a portfolio company of Kinderhook Industries, that is a leading provider of temporary and permanent modular space solutions, for a cash purchase price of $400 million, subject to certain adjustments. The acquisition creates a larger scaled modular business with increased geographic coverage and density to serve customers. Competitive Strengths Market Leadership – Mobile Modular has the leading modular building and container fleet in the United States. Rental units for temporary classroom and other educational space needs are an important market segment and the Company believes Mobile Modular is the leading supplier in California and Florida, and a significant supplier in Texas, of modular educational facilities for rental to both public and private schools. Management is knowledgeable about the needs of its educational customers and the related regulatory requirements in the states where Mobile Modular operates, which enables Mobile Modular to meet its customers’ specific project requirements. Expertise – The Company believes that over the 40 plus years during which Mobile Modular has competed in the modular rental industry, it has developed expertise that differentiates it from its competitors. Mobile Modular has dedicated its attention to continuously developing and improving the quality of its modular units. Mobile Modular has expertise in the licensing and regulatory requirements that govern modulars in the states where it operates, and its management, sales and operational staffs are knowledgeable and committed to providing exemplary customer service. Mobile Modular has expertise in project management and complex applications. - 5 - Operating Structure – Part of the Company’s strategy for Mobile Modular is to create facilities and infrastructure capabilities that its competitors cannot easily duplicate. Mobile Modular achieves this by building regional sales and inventory centers designed to serve a broad geographic area and a large installed customer base under a single overhead structure, thereby reducing its cost per transaction. The Company’s regional facilities and related infrastructure enable Mobile Modular to maximize its modular inventory utilization through efficient and cost effective in-house repair, maintenance and refurbishment for quick redeployment of equipment to meet its customers’ needs. Asset Management – The Company believes Mobile Modular markets high quality, well-constructed and attractive modulars. Mobile Modular requires manufacturers to build to its specifications, which enables Mobile Modular to maintain a standardized quality fleet. In addition, through its ongoing repair, refurbishment and maintenance programs, the Company believes Mobile Modular’s buildings are the best maintained in the industry. The Company depreciates its modular buildings over an 18 year estimated useful life to a 50% residual value. Older buildings continue to be productive primarily because of Mobile Modular’s focus on ongoing fleet maintenance. Also, as a result of Mobile Modular’s maintenance programs, when a modular unit is sold, a high percentage of the equipment’s capitalized cost is recovered. In addition, the fleet’s utilization is regionally optimized by managing inventory through estimates of market demand, fulfillment of current rental and sale order activity, modular returns and capital purchases. Customer Service - The Company believes the modular rental industry to be service intensive and locally based. The Company strives to provide excellent service by meeting its commitments to its customers, being proactive in resolving project issues and seeking to continuously improve the customers’ experience. Mobile Modular is committed to offering quick response to requests for information, providing experienced assistance, on time delivery and preventative maintenance of its units. Mobile Modular’s goal is to continuously improve its procedures, processes and computer systems to enhance internal operational efficiency. The Company believes this dedication to customer service results in high levels of customer loyalty and repeat business. Market Management estimates relocatable modular building rental is an industry that today has equipment on rent or available for rent in the U.S. with an aggregate original cost of over $5.0 billion. Mobile Modular’s largest market segment is for temporary classroom and other educational space needs of public and private schools, colleges and universities in California and Florida, and to a lesser extent in Texas, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C. Management believes the demand for rental classrooms is caused by shifting and fluctuating school populations, the limited state funds for new construction, the need for temporary classroom space during reconstruction of older schools, class size reduction and the phasing out of portable classrooms compliant with older building codes (see “Classroom Rentals and Sales to Public Schools (K-12)” below). Other customer applications include sales offices, construction field offices, health care facilities, church sanctuaries and child care facilities. Industrial, manufacturing, entertainment and utility companies, as well as governmental agencies commonly use large multi-modular complexes to serve their interim administrative and operational space needs. Modulars offer customers quick, cost-effective space solutions while conserving their capital. The Company’s corporate offices and regional sales and inventory center offices are housed in various sizes of modular units. Since most of Mobile Modular’s customer requirements are to fill temporary space needs, Mobile Modular’s marketing emphasis is on rentals rather than sales. Mobile Modular attracts customers through its website at www.mobilemodular.com, internet advertising and direct marketing. Customers are encouraged to visit a regional sales and inventory center to view different models on display and to see a regional office, which is a working example of a modular application. Because service is a major competitive factor in the rental of modulars, Mobile Modular offers quick response to requests for information, assistance in the choice of a suitable size and floor plan, in-house customization services, rapid delivery, timely installation and field service of its units. On Mobile Modular’s website, customers are able to view and select inventory for quotation and request in-field service. Rentals Rental periods range from one month to several years with a typical initial contract term between twelve and twenty-four months. In general, monthly rental rates are determined by a number of factors including length of term, market demand, product availability and product type. Upon expiration of the initial term, or any extensions, rental rates are reviewed, and when appropriate, are adjusted based on current market conditions. Most rental agreements are operating leases that provide no purchase options, and when a rental agreement does provide the customer with a purchase option, it is generally on terms management believes to be attractive to Mobile Modular. The customer is responsible for obtaining the necessary use permits and for the costs of insuring the unit, and is financially responsible for transporting the unit to the site, preparation of the site, installation of the unit, dismantle and return delivery of the unit to Mobile Modular, and certain costs for customization. Mobile Modular maintains the units in good working condition while on rent. Upon return, the units are inspected for damage and customers are billed for items considered beyond normal wear and tear. Generally, - 6 - the units are then repaired for subsequent use. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred and can include floor repairs, roof maintenance, cleaning, painting and other cosmetic repairs. The costs of major refurbishment of equipment are capitalized to the extent the refurbishment significantly improves the quality and adds value or life to the equipment. At December 31, 2022, Mobile Modular owned 70,233 new or previously rented modulars and portable storage containers with an aggregate cost of $1,123.3 million including accessories, or an average cost per unit of $15,993. Utilization is calculated at the end of each month by dividing the cost of rental equipment on rent by the total cost of rental equipment, excluding new equipment inventory and accessory equipment. At December 31, 2022, fleet utilization was 80.7% and average fleet utilization during 2022 was 79.1%. The Mobile Modular segment includes the results of operations of Mobile Modular Portable Storage and Kitchens To Go, which represented approximately 11% and 2% of the Company’s 2022 total revenues, respectively. Sales In addition to operating its rental fleet, Mobile Modular sells modulars to customers. These sales may arise out of its marketing efforts for the rental fleet and from existing equipment already on rent or from specific requests for new buildings for a permanent need. The Company has a dedicated team that focuses on these custom sale opportunities. Such sales can be of either new or used units from the rental fleet, which permits some turnover of older units. During 2022 Mobile Modular’s largest sale represented approximately 4% of Mobile Modular’s sales, 3% of the Company’s consolidated sales and less than 1% of the Company’s consolidated revenues. Mobile Modular typically provides limited 90-day warranties on used modulars and passes through the manufacturers’ one-year warranty on new units to its customers. Warranty costs have not been significant to Mobile Modular’s operations to date, and the Company attributes this to its commitment to high quality standards and regular maintenance programs. However, there can be no assurance that warranty costs will continue to be insignificant to Mobile Modular’s operations in the future. Enviroplex manufactures portable classrooms built to the requirements of the California Division of the State Architect (“DSA”) and sells directly to California public school districts and other educational institutions. Seasonality Typically, during each calendar year, our highest numbers of classrooms are shipped for rental and sale orders during the second and third quarters for delivery and installation prior to the start of the upcoming school year. The majority of classrooms shipped in the second and third quarters have rental start dates during the third quarter, thereby making the fourth quarter the first full quarter of rental revenues recognized for these transactions. Competition Competition in the rental and sale of relocatable modular buildings is intense. Some of our competitors in the modular building leasing industry, notably WillScot Mobile Mini Holdings Corp, have a greater range of products and services, greater financial and marketing resources, larger customer bases, and greater name recognition than we have. In addition, a number of other smaller companies operate regionally throughout the country. Mobile Modular operates primarily in California, the Pacific Northwest, Texas, Florida, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, Maryland and Washington, D.C. Significant competitive factors in the rental business include availability, price, service, reliability, appearance and functionality of the product. Mobile Modular markets high quality, well-constructed and attractive modulars. Part of the Company’s strategy for modulars is to create facilities and infrastructure capabilities that its competitors cannot easily duplicate. The Company's facilities and related infrastructure enable it to modify modulars efficiently and cost effectively to meet its customers’ needs. Management's goal is to be more responsive at less expense. Management believes this strategy, together with its emphasis on prompt and efficient customer service, gives Mobile Modular a competitive advantage. Mobile Modular is determined to respond quickly to requests for information, and provide experienced assistance for the first-time user, rapid delivery and timely repair of its modular units. Mobile Modular’s already high level of efficiency and responsiveness continues to improve as the Company upgrades procedures, processes and computer systems that control its internal operations. The Company anticipates intense competition to continue and believes it must continue to improve its products and services to remain competitive in the market for modulars. Classroom Rentals and Sales to Public Schools (K-12) Mobile Modular and Enviroplex provide classroom and specialty space needs serving public and private schools, colleges and universities. Within the educational market, the rental (by Mobile Modular) and sale (by Enviroplex and Mobile Modular) of modulars to public school districts for use as portable classrooms, restroom buildings and administrative offices for kindergarten through grade twelve (K-12) are a significant portion of the Company’s revenues. Mobile Modular rents and sells classrooms in California, the Pacific Northwest, Florida, Texas, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C. Enviroplex sells classrooms in the California market. California is Mobile Modular’s largest educational market. Historically, demand in this market has been fueled by shifting and fluctuating student populations, insufficient funding for new school construction, class size reduction - 7 - programs, modernization of aging school facilities and the phasing out of portable classrooms no longer compliant with current building codes. The following table shows the approximate percentages of the Company’s modular rental and sales revenues, and of its consolidated rental and sales revenues for the past five years, that rentals and sales to these schools constitute: Rentals and Sales to Public Schools (K-12) as a Percentage of Total Rental and Sales Revenues Percentage of: 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 Modular Rental Revenues (Mobile Modular) 24% 28% 33% 32% 33% Modular Sales Revenues (Mobile Modular & Enviroplex) 42% 49% 48% 64% 70% Modular Rental and Sales Revenues (Mobile Modular & Enviroplex) 29% 34% 38% 42% 44% Consolidated Rental and Sales Revenues 1 19% 21% 23% 25% 24% School Facility Funding Funding for public school facilities is derived from a variety of sources including the passage of both statewide and local facility bond measures, operating budgets, developer fees, various taxes including parcel and sales taxes levied to support school operating budgets, and lottery funds. There is no certainty on the timing of the bond sales and it could take additional years before projects funded by these bonds generate meaningful demand for relocatable classrooms. - 8 - ELECTRONIC TEST EQUIPMENT Description TRS-RenTelco rents and sells electronic test equipment nationally and internationally from two facilities located on the grounds of the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport in Grapevine, Texas (the “Dallas facility”) and Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Canada (the “Montreal facility”). TRS-RenTelco’s revenues are derived from the rental and sale of general purpose and communications test equipment to a broad range of companies, from Fortune 500 to middle and smaller market companies, in the aerospace, defense, communications, manufacturing and semiconductor industries. Electronic test equipment revenues are primarily affected by the business activity within these industries related to research and development, manufacturing, and communication infrastructure installation and maintenance. The Dallas facility, TRS-RenTelco’s primary operating location, houses the electronic test equipment inventory, sales engineers, calibration laboratories, and operations staff for U.S. and international business. The Montreal facility houses sales engineers and operations staff to serve the Canadian market. As of December 31, 2022, the original cost of electronic test equipment inventory was comprised of 80% general purpose electronic test equipment and 20% communications electronic test equipment. Engineers, technicians and scientists utilize general purpose electronic test equipment in developing products, controlling manufacturing processes, completing field service applications and evaluating the performance of their own electrical and electronic equipment. These instruments are rented primarily to aerospace, defense, electronics, industrial, research and semiconductor industries. To date, Keysight Technologies, Rhode & Schwarz and Tektronix, a division of Fortive Corporation, have manufactured the majority of TRS-RenTelco’s general purpose electronic test equipment with the remainder acquired from over 60 other manufacturers. Communications test equipment, including fiber optic test equipment, is utilized by technicians, engineers and installation contractors to evaluate voice, data and multimedia communications networks, to install fiber optic cabling, and in the development and manufacturing of transmission, network and wireless products. These instruments are rented primarily to manufacturers of communications equipment and products, electrical and communications installation contractors, field technicians, and service providers. To date, Anritsu, Viavi Solutions and Fluke Networks, a division of Fortive Corporation, have manufactured a significant portion of TRS-RenTelco’s communications test equipment, with the remainder acquired from over 40 other manufacturers. TRS-RenTelco’s general purpose test equipment rental inventory includes oscilloscopes, amplifiers, analyzers (spectrum, network and logic), signal source and power source test equipment. The communications test equipment rental inventory includes network and transmission test equipment for various fiber, copper and wireless networks. TRS-RenTelco occasionally rents electronic test equipment from other rental companies and re-rents the equipment to customers. Competitive Strengths Market Leadership - The Company believes that TRS-RenTelco is one of the largest electronic test equipment rental and leasing companies offering a broad and deep selection of general purpose and communications test equipment for rent in North America. Expertise - The Company believes that its knowledge of products, technology and applications expertise provides it with a competitive advantage over others in the industry. Customer requirements are supported by application engineers and technicians that are knowledgeable about the equipment’s uses to ensure the right equipment is selected to meet the customer’s needs. This knowledge can be attributed to the experience of TRS-RenTelco’s management, sales and operational teams. Operating Structure - TRS-RenTelco is supported by a centralized distribution and inventory center on the grounds of the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport in Texas. The Company believes that the centralization of servicing all customers in North America and internationally by TRS-RenTelco’s experienced logistics teams provides a competitive advantage by minimizing transaction costs and enabling TRS-RenTelco to ensure customer requirements are met. Asset Management - TRS-RenTelco’s rental equipment inventory is serviced by an ISO 9001-2015 registered and compliant calibration laboratory that repairs and calibrates equipment ensuring that off rent equipment is ready to ship immediately to meet customers’ needs. TRS-RenTelco’s team of technicians, product managers and sales personnel are continuously monitoring and analyzing the utilization of existing products, new technologies, general economic conditions and estimates of customer demand to ensure the right equipment is purchased and sold, at the right point in the equipment’s technology life cycle. The Company believes this enables it to maximize utilization of equipment and the cash flow generated by the rental and sales revenue of each model of equipment. TRS-RenTelco strives to maintain strong relationships with equipment manufacturers, which enables it to leverage those relationships to gain rental opportunities. Customer Service - The Company believes that its focus on providing excellent service to its customers provides a competitive advantage. TRS-RenTelco strives to provide exemplary service to fulfill its commitments to its customers. TRS-RenTelco prides itself in providing solutions to meet customers’ needs by having equipment available and responding quickly and thoroughly to their requests. - 9 - TRS-RenTelco’s sophisticated in-house laboratory ensures the equipment is fully functional and meets its customers’ delivery requirements. Service needs of TRS-RenTelco’s customers are supported 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by its customer care specialists. TRS-RenTelco’s goal is to provide service beyond its customers’ expectations, which, the Company believes, results in customer loyalty and repeat business. Market Electronic test equipment rental is a market which we estimate has equipment on rent worldwide or available for rent with an aggregate original cost in excess of $1 billion. There is a broad customer base for the rental of such instruments, including aerospace, communications, defense, electrical contractor, electronics, industrial, installer contractor, network systems and research companies. TRS-RenTelco markets its electronic test equipment throughout the United States, Canada, and, to a limited extent, other countries. TRS-RenTelco attracts customers through its outside sales force, website at www.TRSRenTelco.com, telemarketing program, trade show participation, paid internet search and electronic mail campaigns. A key part of the sales process is TRS-RenTelco’s knowledgeable inside sales engineering team that effectively matches test equipment solutions to meet specific customer’s requirements. The Company believes that customers rent electronic test equipment for many reasons. Customers frequently need equipment for short-term projects, to evaluate new products, and for backup to avoid costly downtime. Delivery times for the purchase of such equipment can be lengthy; thus, renting allows the customer to obtain the equipment expeditiously. The Company also believes that the relative certainty of rental costs can facilitate cost control and be useful in the bidding of and pass-through of contract costs. Finally, renting rather than purchasing may better satisfy the customer’s budgetary constraints. Rentals TRS-RenTelco rents electronic test equipment typically for rental periods of one to six months, although in some instances, rental terms can be up to a year or longer. Monthly rental rates typically are between 2% and 10% of the current manufacturers’ list price. TRS-RenTelco depreciates its equipment over 1 to 8 years with no residual value. At December 31, 2022, TRS-RenTelco had an electronic test equipment rental inventory including accessories with an aggregate cost of $398.3 million. Utilization is calculated each month by dividing the cost of the rental equipment on rent by the total cost of rental equipment, excluding accessory equipment. Utilization was 59.4% as of December 31, 2022 and averaged 64.2% during the year. Sales Profit from equipment sales is a material component of TRS-RenTelco’s overall annual earnings. Gross profit from sales of both used and new equipment over the last five years generally has ranged from approximately 20% to 23% of total annual gross profit for our electronics division. For 2022, gross profit on equipment sales was approximately 22% of total division gross profit. Equipment sales are driven by the turnover of older technology rental equipment, to maintain target utilization at a model number level, and new equipment sales opportunities. In 2022, approximately 16% of the electronic test equipment revenues were derived from sales. The largest electronic test equipment sale during 2022 represented 8% of electronic test equipment sales, 1% of the Company’s consolidated sales and less than 1% of consolidated revenues. There is intense competition in the sales of electronic test equipment from a world-wide network of test equipment brokers and resellers, legacy rental companies, and equipment manufacturers. We believe the annual world-wide sales of electronic test equipment is in excess of $8.0 billion per year. Seasonality Rental activity may decline in the fourth quarter month of December and the first quarter months of January and February. These months may have lower rental activity due to holiday closures, particularly by larger companies, inclement weather and its impact on various field related communications equipment rentals, and companies’ operational recovery from holiday closures which may impact the start-up of new projects coming online in the first quarter. These factors may impact the quarterly results of each year’s first and fourth quarter. Competition The electronic test equipment rental business is characterized by intense competition from several competitors, including Electro Rent Corporation, Continental Resources, and TestEquity, some of which may have access to greater financial and other resources than we do. TRS-RenTelco competes with these and other test equipment rental companies on the basis of product availability, price, service and reliability. Although no single competitor holds a dominant market share, we face intense competition from these established entities and new entrants in the market. Some of our competitors may offer similar equipment for lease, rental or sales at lower prices and may offer more extensive servicing, or financing options. - 10 - LIQUID AND SOLID CONTAINMENT TANKS AND BOXES Description Adler Tanks’ rental inventory is comprised of tanks and boxes used for various containment solutions to store hazardous and non-hazardous liquids and solids in applications such as: refinery, chemical and industrial plant maintenance, environmental remediation and field services, infrastructure building construction, marine services, oil and gas exploration and field services, pipeline construction and maintenance, tank terminals services, wastewater treatment, and waste management and landfill services. The tanks and boxes are comprised of the following products: Adler Tanks purchases tanks and boxes from various manufacturers located throughout the country. On February 1, 2023, the Company sold the Adler Tanks business to Ironclad Environmental Solutions, Inc., a Kinderhook portfolio company, for a cash sale price of $265 million, subject to certain adjustments.

The fleet’s utilization is regionally optimized by understanding key vertical market customer demand, seasonality factors, competitor’s product availability and expected equipment returns. Market Liquid and solid containment equipment rental is a market in the U.S with a large and diverse number of market segments including refinery, chemical and industrial plant maintenance, environmental remediation and field services, infrastructure building construction, marine services, oil and gas exploration and field services, pipeline construction and maintenance, electrical grid transformer maintenance, tank terminals services, wastewater treatment, and waste management and landfill services. The tank and box rental products may be utilized throughout the U.S. and are not subject to any local or regional construction code or approval standards. Rentals Adler Tanks rents tanks and boxes typically for rental periods of one to six months, although in some instances, rental terms can be up to a year or longer. Monthly rental rates typically are between 2% and 10% of the equipment’s original acquisition cost. At December 31, 2022, Adler Tanks had rental equipment inventory including accessories with an aggregate cost of $308.4 million. Utilization is calculated each month by dividing the cost of the rental equipment on rent by the total cost of rental equipment, excluding accessory equipment. Utilization was 57.1% at December 31, 2022 and averaged 53.1% during the year. - 11 - Seasonality Rental activity may decline in the fourth quarter month of December and the first quarter months of January and February. These months may have lower rental activity due to inclement weather in certain regions of the country impacting the industries that we serve. Competition The liquid and solid containment rental industry is highly competitive including national, regional and local companies. Some of our national competitors, notably United Rentals and Rain For Rent, may be larger than we are and may have greater financial and other resources than we have. Some of our competitors also have longer operating histories and lower cost basis of rental equipment than we have. In addition, certain of our competitors are more geographically diverse than we are and have greater name recognition among customers than we do. As a result, our competitors that have these advantages may be better able to attract and retain customers and provide their products and services at lower rental rates. Adler Tanks competes with these companies based upon product availability, product quality, price, service and reliability. Adler Tanks may encounter increased competition in the markets that it serves from existing competitors or from new market entrants in the future.

RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the following discussion of various risks and uncertainties. We believe these risk factors are the most relevant to our business and could cause our results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made by us. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be seriously harmed if any of these risks or uncertainties actually occur or materialize. In that event, the market price for our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. RISKS RELATED TO OUR STRATEGY AND OPERATION: Our future operating results may fluctuate, fail to match past performance or fail to meet expectations, which may result in a decrease in our stock price. Our operating results may fluctuate in the future, may fail to match our past performance or fail to meet the expectations of analysts and investors. Our results and related ratios, such as gross margin, operating income percentage and effective tax rate may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control including but not limited to: As a result of these factors, our historical financial results are not necessarily indicative of our future results or stock price. Our stock price has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate in the future, which may result in a decline in the value of your investment in our common stock. The market price of our common stock fluctuates on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and is likely to be affected by a number of factors including but not limited to: - 15 - In addition, in recent years the U.S. stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations are often unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. Additionally, the most recent global credit crisis adversely affected the prices of most publicly traded stocks as many stockholders became more willing to divest their stock holdings at lower values to increase their cash flow and reduce exposure to such fluctuations. These broad market fluctuations and any other negative economic trends may cause declines in the market price of our common stock and may be based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our Company or its performance, and these fluctuations and trends could materially reduce our stock price. The impact of COVID-19 on our operations, and the operations of our customers, suppliers and logistics providers, may harm our business. We continue to monitor the ongoing impact of COVID-19 outbreak around the globe. This includes evaluating the impact on our customers, suppliers, and logistics providers as well as evaluating governmental actions being taken to curtail the spread of the virus. Significant uncertainty continues to exist concerning the magnitude of the impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and related variants. While the Company’s operating segments and branch locations currently continue to operate, the Company’s results of operations may be negatively impacted by project delays, supply chain delays or disruptions; elevated costs for materials and labor; early returns of equipment currently on rent with customers; overall decreased customer demand for new rental orders, rental related services and sales of new and used rental equipment; and payment delay, or non-payment, by customers who are significantly impacted by COVID-19. Our ability to retain our executive management and to recruit, retain and motivate key qualified employees is critical to the success of our business. If we cannot successfully recruit and retain qualified personnel, our operating results and stock price may suffer. We believe that our success is directly linked to the competent people in our organization, including our executive officers, senior managers and other key personnel, and in particular, Joe Hanna, our Chief Executive Officer. Personnel turnover can be costly and could materially and adversely impact our operating results and can potentially jeopardize the success of our current strategic initiatives. We need to attract and retain highly qualified personnel to replace personnel when turnover occurs, as well as add to our staff levels as growth occurs. Our business and stock price likely will suffer if we are unable to fill, or experience delays in filling open positions, or fail to retain key personnel. Failure by third parties to manufacture and deliver our products to our specifications or on a timely basis may harm our reputation and financial condition. We depend on third parties to manufacture our products even though we are able to purchase products from a variety of third-party suppliers. In the future, we may be limited as to the number of third-party suppliers for some of our products. Although in general we make advance purchases of some products to help ensure an adequate supply, currently we do not have any long-term purchase contracts with any third-party supplier. We may experience supply problems as a result of financial or operating difficulties or failure of our suppliers, or shortages and discontinuations resulting from product obsolescence or other shortages or allocations by our suppliers. Unfavorable economic conditions may also adversely affect our suppliers or the terms on which we purchase products. In the future, we may not be able to negotiate arrangements with third parties to secure products that we require in sufficient quantities or on reasonable terms. If we cannot negotiate arrangements with third parties to produce our products or if the third parties fail to produce our products to our specifications or in a timely manner, our reputation and financial condition could be harmed. We are subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security which could subject us to liability, reputational damage or interrupt the operation of our business. We rely upon our information technology systems and infrastructure for our business. We sustained an immaterial cybersecurity attack in 2021 involving ransomware that impacted certain of our systems but was unsuccessful in its ability to disrupt our network. Our investigation revealed that an unauthorized third party copied some personal information relating to certain current and former employees, directors, contractor workers and their dependents and certain other persons. Upon detection, we promptly undertook steps - 16 - to address the incident, restored network systems and resumed normal operations. The attack did not result in any material disruption to our operations or ability to service our customers and did not affect our financial performance. In the future, we could experience additional breaches of our security measures resulting in the theft of confidential information or reputational damage from industrial espionage attacks, malware or other cyber-attacks, which may compromise our system infrastructure or lead to data leakage, either internally or at our third-party providers. Similarly, additional data privacy breaches by those who access our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to us, our employees, customers or other business partners, may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. The immaterial breach of our information technology system and any future breaches could subject us to reputational damage. Cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and have become increasingly difficult to detect. There can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our data and information technology systems will prevent future breaches in our systems (or that of our third-party providers) that could adversely affect our business and result in financial and reputational harm to us, theft of trade secrets and other proprietary information, legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties. Disruptions in our information technology systems or failure to protect these systems against security breaches could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Additionally, if these systems fail, become unavailable for any period of time or are not upgraded, this could limit our ability to effectively monitor and control our operations and adversely affect our operations. Our information technology systems facilitate our ability to transact business, monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions. We sustained an immaterial cybersecurity attack in 2021 involving ransomware that impacted certain of our systems, but was unsuccessful in its ability to disrupt our network. Upon detection, we promptly undertook steps to address the incident, restored network systems and resumed normal operations. Any future cybersecurity attack causing disruption in our information technology systems or the failure of these systems to operate as expected could, depending on the magnitude of the problem, adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively transact business, monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions in a timely manner. In addition, because of recent advances in technology and well-known efforts on the part of computer hackers and cyber-terrorists to breach data security of companies, we face risks associated with failure to adequately protect critical corporate, customer and employee data, which could adversely impact our customer relationships, our reputation, and even violate privacy laws. As part of our business, we develop, receive and retain confidential data about our company and our customers. Further, the delay or failure to implement information system upgrades and new systems effectively could disrupt our business, distract management’s focus and attention from our business operations and growth initiatives, and increase our implementation and operating costs, any of which could negatively impact our operations and operating results. We have engaged in acquisitions and may engage in future acquisitions that could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and business. In the second quarter 2021, we acquired the assets of Design Space Modular Buildings PNW, LP (“Design Space”), a provider of modular buildings and portable storage containers for rental and sale to customers in the West and Pacific Northwest states in the U.S. and GRS Holding LLC, DBA Kitchens to Go (“Kitchens To Go”), a provider of interim and permanent modular solutions for foodservice providers that require flexible facilities to continue or expand operations. In the first quarter of 2023, the Company acquired Vesta Modular, a portfolio company of Kinderhook Industries, that is a leading provider of temporary and permanent modular space solutions. We anticipate that we will continue to consider acquisitions in the future that meet our strategic growth plans. We are unable to predict whether or when any prospective acquisition will be completed. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following: - 17 - Acquisitions are inherently risky, and no assurance can be given that our recent and future acquisitions will be successful or will not adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. The success of our acquisition strategy depends upon our ability to successfully complete acquisitions and integrate any businesses that we acquire into our existing business. The difficulties of integration could be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically dispersed organizations; maintaining acceptable standards, controls, procedures and policies; integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds; combining different corporate cultures; and the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management and other personnel. In addition, if we consummate one or more significant future acquisitions in which the consideration consists of stock or other securities, our existing shareholders’ ownership could be diluted significantly. If we were to proceed with one or more significant future acquisitions in which the consideration included cash, we could be required to use, to the extent available, a substantial portion of our Credit Facility. If we increase the amount borrowed against our available credit line, we would increase the risk of breaching the covenants under our credit facilities with our lenders. In addition, it would limit our ability to make other investments, or we may be required to seek additional debt or equity financing. Any of these items could adversely affect our results of operations. We continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment, and we cannot be certain that our business, operating results and financial condition will not be materially and adversely affected. A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including reaching an agreement with potential buyers on terms we deem attractive, as well as our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities, and employees to any purchaser, identify and separate the assets to be divested from the assets that we wish to retain, reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business, and collect the proceeds from any divestitures. These efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. If we do not realize the expected benefits of any divestiture transaction, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. In addition, divestitures of businesses involve a number of risks, including significant costs and expenses, the loss of customer relationships and a decrease in revenues and earnings associated with the divested business. Furthermore, divestitures potentially involve significant post-closing separation activities, which could involve the expenditure of material financial resources and significant employee resources. Any divestiture may result in a dilutive impact to our future earnings if we are unable to offset the dilutive impact from the loss of revenue associated with the divestiture, as well as significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. If we determine that our goodwill and intangible assets have become impaired, we may incur impairment charges, which would negatively impact our operating results. At December 31, 2022, we had $173.4 million of goodwill and intangible assets, net, on our consolidated balance sheets. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, we assess potential impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets at least annually, as well as on an interim basis to the extent that factors or indicators become apparent that could reduce the fair value of any of our businesses below book value. Impairment may result from significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired asset, negative industry or economic trends and significant underperformance relative to historic or projected operating results. - 18 - Our rental equipment is subject to residual value risk upon disposition and may not sell at the prices or in the quantities we expect. The market value of any given piece of rental equipment could be less than its depreciated value at the time it is sold. The market value of used rental equipment depends on several factors, including: We include in income from operations the difference between the sales price and the depreciated value of an item of equipment sold. Changes in our assumptions regarding depreciation could change our depreciation expense, as well as the gain or loss realized upon disposal of equipment. Sales of our used rental equipment at prices that fall significantly below our projections or in lesser quantities than we anticipate will have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. If we do not effectively manage our credit risk, collect on our accounts receivable or recover our rental equipment from our customers’ sites, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We generally rent and sell to customers on 30 day payment terms, individually perform credit evaluation procedures on our customers for each transaction and require security deposits or other forms of security from our customers when a significant credit risk is identified. Historically, accounts receivable write-offs and write-offs related to equipment not returned by customers have not been significant and have averaged less than 1% of total revenues over the last five years. If economic conditions deteriorate, we may see an increase in bad debt relative to historical levels, which may materially and adversely affect our operations. Business segments that experience significant market disruptions or declines may experience increased customer credit risk and higher bad debt expense. Failure to manage our credit risk and receive timely payments on our customer accounts receivable may result in write-offs and/or loss of equipment, particularly electronic test equipment. If we are not able to effectively manage credit risk issues, or if a large number of our customers should have financial difficulties at the same time, our receivables and equipment losses could increase above historical levels. If this should occur, our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. Effective management of our rental assets is vital to our business. If we are not successful in these efforts, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Our modular, electronics and liquid and solid containment rental products have long useful lives and managing those assets is a critical element to each of our rental businesses. Generally, we design units and find manufacturers to build them to our specifications for our modular and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes. Modular asset management requires designing and building the product for a long life that anticipates the needs of our customers, including anticipating potential changes in legislation, regulations, building codes and local permitting in the various markets in which the Company operates. Electronic test equipment asset management requires understanding, selecting and investing in equipment technologies that support market demand, including anticipating technological advances and changes in manufacturers’ selling prices. Liquid and solid containment asset management requires designing and building the product for a long life, using quality components and repairing and maintaining the products to prevent leaks. For each of our modular, electronic test equipment and liquid and solid containment assets, we must successfully maintain and repair this equipment cost-effectively to maximize the useful life of the products and the level of proceeds from the sale of such products. To the extent that we are unable to do so, our result of operations could be materially adversely affected. The nature of our businesses, including the ownership of industrial property, exposes us to the risk of litigation and liability under environmental, health and safety and products liability laws. Violations of environmental or health and safety related laws or associated liability could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to national, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, solid and liquid waste and hazardous substances handling, storage and disposal and employee health and safety. These laws and regulations are complex and frequently change. We could incur unexpected costs, penalties and other civil and criminal liability if we fail to comply with applicable environmental or health and safety laws. We also could incur costs or liabilities related to waste disposal or remediating soil or groundwater contamination at our properties, at our customers’ properties or at third party landfill and disposal sites. These liabilities can be imposed on the parties generating, transporting or disposing of such substances or on the owner or operator of any affected property, often without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous substances. - 19 - Several aspects of our businesses involve risks of environmental and health and safety liability. For example, our operations involve the use of petroleum products, solvents and other hazardous substances in the construction and maintaining of modular buildings and for fueling and maintaining our delivery trucks and vehicles. We also own, transport and rent tanks and boxes in which waste materials are placed by our customers. The historical operations at some of our previously or currently owned or leased and newly acquired or leased properties may have resulted in undiscovered soil or groundwater contamination or historical non-compliance by third parties for which we could be held liable. Future events, such as changes in existing laws or policies or their enforcement, or the discovery of currently unknown contamination or non-compliance, may also give rise to liabilities or other claims based on these operations that may be material. In addition, compliance with future environmental or health and safety laws and regulations may require significant capital or operational expenditures or changes to our operations. Accordingly, in addition to potential penalties for non-compliance, we may become liable, either contractually or by operation of law, for investigation, remediation and monitoring costs even if the contaminated property is not presently owned or operated by us, or if the contamination was caused by third parties during or prior to our ownership or operation of the property. In addition, certain parties may be held liable for more than their “fair” share of environmental investigation and cleanup costs. Contamination and exposure to hazardous substances or other contaminants such as mold can also result in claims for remediation or damages, including personal injury, property damage, and natural resources damage claims. Although expenses related to environmental compliance, health and safety issues, and related matters have not been material to date, we cannot assure that we will not have to make significant expenditures in the future in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Violations of environmental or health and safety related laws or associated liability could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In general, litigation in the industries in which we operate, including class actions that seek substantial damages, arises with increasing frequency. Enforcement of environmental and health and safety requirements is also frequent. Such proceedings are invariably expensive, regardless of the merit of the plaintiffs’ or prosecutors’ claims. We may be named as a defendant in the future, and there can be no assurance, irrespective of the merit of such future actions, that we will not be required to make substantial settlement payments in the future. Further, a significant portion of our business is conducted in California which is one of the most highly regulated and litigious states in the country. Therefore, our potential exposure to losses and expenses due to new laws, regulations or litigation may be greater than companies with a less significant California presence. The nature of our business also subjects us to property damage and product liability claims, especially in connection with our modular buildings and tank and box rental businesses. Although we maintain liability coverage that we believe is commercially reasonable, an unusually large property damage or product liability claim or a series of claims could exceed our insurance coverage or result in damage to our reputation. Our routine business activities expose us to risk of litigation from employees, vendors and other third parties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We may be subject to claims arising from disputes with employees, vendors and other third parties in the normal course of our business; these risks may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. If the plaintiffs in any suits against us were to successfully prosecute their claims, or if we were to settle any such suits by making significant payments to the plaintiffs, our operating results and financial condition would be harmed. Even if the outcome of a claim proves favorable to us, litigation can be time consuming and costly and may divert management resources. In addition, our organizational documents require us to indemnify our senior executives to the maximum extent permitted by California law. We maintain directors’ and officers’ liability insurance that we believe is commercially reasonable in connection with such obligations, but if our senior executives were named in any lawsuit, our indemnification obligations could magnify the costs of these suits and/or exceed the coverage of such policies. If we suffer loss to our facilities, equipment or distribution system due to catastrophe, our insurance policies could be inadequate or depleted, our operations could be seriously harmed, which could negatively affect our operating results. Our facilities, rental equipment and distribution systems may be subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, hurricane, earthquake, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters. In particular, our headquarters, three operating facilities, and certain of our rental equipment are located in areas of California, with above average seismic activity and could be subject to catastrophic loss caused by an earthquake. Our rental equipment and facilities in Texas, Louisiana, Florida, North Carolina and Georgia are located in areas subject to hurricanes and other tropical storms. In addition to customers’ insurance on rented equipment, we carry property insurance on our rental equipment in inventory and operating facilities as well as business interruption insurance. We believe our insurance policies have adequate limits and deductibles to mitigate the potential loss exposure of our business. We do not maintain financial reserves for policy deductibles and our insurance policies contain exclusions that are customary for our industry, including exclusions for earthquakes, flood and terrorism. If any of our facilities or a significant amount of our rental equipment were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay orders, shipments and revenue recognition and result in expenses to repair or replace the damaged rental equipment and facility not covered by insurance, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. - 20 - INTEREST RATE AND INDEBTEDNESS RISKS: Our debt instruments contain covenants that restrict or prohibit our ability to enter into a variety of transactions and may limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs. If we have an event of default under these instruments, our indebtedness could be accelerated, and we may not be able to refinance such indebtedness or make the required accelerated payments. The agreements governing our Series C, D and E Senior Notes (as defined and more fully described under the heading “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources”) and our Credit Facility contain various covenants that limit our discretion in operating our business. In particular, we are limited in our ability to merge, consolidate, reorganize or transfer substantially all of our assets, make investments, pay dividends or distributions, redeem or repurchase stock, change the nature of our business, enter into transactions with affiliates, incur indebtedness and create liens on our assets to secure debt. In addition, we are required to meet certain financial covenants under these instruments. These restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financing, make strategic acquisitions or needed capital expenditures, withstand economic downturns in our business or the economy in general, conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise. A failure to comply with the restrictions contained in these agreements could lead to an event of default, which could result in an acceleration of our indebtedness. In the event of an acceleration, we may not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to refinance our indebtedness or make any required accelerated payments. If we default on our indebtedness, our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The majority of our indebtedness is subject to variable interest rates, which makes us vulnerable to increases in interest rates, which could negatively affect our net income. Our indebtedness exposes us to interest rate increases because the majority of our indebtedness is subject to variable rates. At present, we do not have any derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps or hedges to mitigate interest rate variability. The interest rates under our credit facilities are reset at varying periods. These interest rate adjustments could cause periodic fluctuations in our operating results and cash flows. Our annual debt service obligations increase by approximately $3.1 million per year for each 1% increase in the average interest rate we pay based on the $313.8 million balance of variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2022. If interest rates rise in the future, and, particularly if they rise significantly, interest expense will increase and our net income will be negatively affected. GENERAL RISKS: Our effective tax rate may change and become less predictable as our business expands, or as a result of federal and state tax law changes, making our future earnings less predictable. We continue to consider expansion opportunities domestically and internationally for our rental businesses. Since the Company’s effective tax rate depends on business levels, personnel and assets located in various jurisdictions, further expansion into new markets or acquisitions may change the effective tax rate in the future and may make it, and consequently our earnings, less predictable going forward. Further, the enactment of future tax law changes by federal and state taxing authorities may impact the Company’s current period tax provision and its deferred tax liabilities. In addition, the amount and timing of stock-based compensation may also impact the Company’s current tax provision. Changes in financial accounting standards may cause lower than expected operating results and affect our reported results of operations. Changes in accounting standards and their application may have a significant effect on our reported results on a going-forward basis and may also affect the recording and disclosure of previously reported transactions. New accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred in the past and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business. Adverse economic conditions in the United States and globally, including the potential onset of recession, could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Adverse macroeconomic conditions in the United States and globally, including inflation, slower than expected growth or recession, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, tightening of the credit markets, higher interest rates and currency fluctuations, could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. These factors could negatively affect demand for our business. Adverse economic conditions in the United States and globally have from time to time caused or exacerbated significant slowdowns in our industry and in the markets in which we operate, which have adversely affected our business and results of operations. - 21 - Macroeconomic weakness and uncertainty also make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue, gross margin and expenses, and may make it more difficult to refinance debt. Furthermore, sustained uncertainty about, or worsening of, current global economic conditions, including further escalation of tensions between Russia and Western countries, as well as further escalation of trade tensions between the U.S. and China, could result in a global economic slowdown and long-term changes to global trade. Any or all of these factors could negatively affect our revenue and could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and growth. Environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters may impact our business and reputation. Governmental authorities, non-governmental organizations, customers, investors, external stakeholders and employees are increasingly sensitive to ESG concerns. This focus on ESG concerns may lead to new requirements that could result in increased costs for our business. Our ability to compete could also be affected by changing customer preferences and requirements, such as growing demand for more environmentally friendly products, supplier practices, or by failure to meet such customer expectations or demand. We risk negative shareholder reaction, including from proxy advisory services, as well as damage to our reputation, if we do not act responsibly, or if we are perceived to not be acting responsibly in key ESG areas. If we do not meet the ESG expectations of our investors, customers and other stakeholders, we could experience reduced demand for our products, loss of customers, and other negative impacts on our business and results of operations. SPECIFIC RISKS RELATED TO OUR RELOCATABLE MODULAR BUILDINGS BUSINESS SEGMENT: Significant reductions of, or delays in, funding to public schools have caused the demand and pricing for our modular classroom units to decline, which has in the past caused, and may cause in the future, a reduction in our revenues and profitability. Rentals and sales of modular buildings to public school districts for use as classrooms, restroom buildings, and administrative offices for K-12 represent a significant portion of Mobile Modular’s rental and sales revenues. Funding for public school facilities is derived from a variety of sources including the passage of both statewide and local facility bond measures, developer fees and various taxes levied to support school operating budgets. Many of these funding sources are subject to financial and political considerations, which vary from district to district and are not tied to demand. Historically, we have benefited from the passage of statewide and local facility bond measures and believe these are essential to our business. The state of California is our largest market for classroom rentals. The strength of this market depends heavily on public funding from voter passage of both state and local facility bond measures, and the ability of the state to sell such bonds in the public market. A lack of passage of state and local facility bond measures, or the inability to sell bonds in the public markets in the future could reduce our revenues and operating income, and consequently have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition. Furthermore, even if voters have approved facility bond measures and the state has raised bond funds, there is no guarantee that individual school projects will be funded in a timely manner. As a consequence of the most recent economic recession, many states and local governments experienced large budget deficits resulting in severe budgetary constraints among public school districts. To the extent public school districts’ funding is reduced for the rental and purchase of modular buildings, our business could be harmed and our results of operations negatively impacted. We believe that interruptions or delays in the passage of facility bond measures or completion of state budgets, an insufficient amount of state funding, a significant reduction of funding to public schools, or changes negatively impacting enrollment may reduce the rental and sale demand for our educational products. Any reductions in funding available to the school districts from the states in which we do business may cause school districts to experience budget shortfalls and to reduce their demand for our products despite growing student populations, class size reduction initiatives and modernization and reconstruction project needs, which could reduce our revenues and operating income and consequently have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition. Public policies that create demand for our products and services may change, resulting in decreased demand for or the pricing of our products and services, which could negatively affect our revenues and operating income. Various states that we operate enacted laws and constitutional amendments to provide funding for school districts to limit the number of students that may be grouped in a single classroom. School districts with class sizes in excess of state limits have been and continue to be a significant source of our demand for modular classrooms. In California, efforts to address aging infrastructure and deferred maintenance have resulted in modernization and reconstruction projects by public school districts including seismic retrofitting, asbestos abatement and various building repairs and upgrades, which has been another source of demand for our modular classrooms. The most recent economic recession caused state and local budget shortfalls, which reduced school districts’ funding and their ability to comply with state class size reduction requirements. If educational priorities and policies shift away from class-size reduction or modernization and reconstruction projects, demand and pricing for our products and services may decline, not grow as quickly as, or not reach the levels that we anticipate. Significant equipment returns may result in lower utilization until equipment can be redeployed or sold, which may cause rental rates to decline and negatively affect our revenues and operating income. - 22 - Failure to comply with applicable regulations could harm our business and financial condition, resulting in lower operating results and cash flows. Similar to conventionally constructed buildings, the modular building industry, including the manufacturers and lessors of portable classrooms, are subject to regulations by multiple governmental agencies at the federal, state and local level relating to environmental, zoning, health, safety, energy efficiency, labor and transportation matters, among other matters. Failure to comply with these laws or regulations could impact our business or harm our reputation and result in higher capital or operating expenditures or the imposition of penalties or restrictions on our operations. As with conventional construction, typically new codes and regulations are not retroactively applied. Nonetheless, new governmental regulations in these or other areas may increase our acquisition cost of new rental equipment, limit the use of or make obsolete some of our existing equipment, or increase our costs of rental operations. Building codes are generally reviewed every three years. All aspects of a given code are subject to change including, but not limited to, such items as structural specifications for earthquake safety, energy efficiency and environmental standards, fire and life safety, transportation, lighting and noise limits. Compliance with building codes and regulations entails a certain amount of risk as state and local government authorities do not necessarily interpret building codes and regulations in a consistent manner, particularly where applicable regulations may be unclear and subject to interpretation. These regulations often provide broad discretion to governmental authorities that oversee these matters, which can result in unanticipated delays or increases in the cost of compliance in particular markets. The construction and modular industries have developed many “best practices” which are constantly evolving. Some of our peers and competitors may adopt practices that are more or less stringent than the Company’s. When, and if, regulatory standards are clarified, the effect of the clarification may be to impose rules on our business and practices retroactively, at which time, we may not be in compliance with such regulations and we may be required to incur costly remediation. If we are unable to pass these increased costs on to our customers, our profitability, operating cash flows and financial condition could be negatively impacted. Expansions of our modular operations into new markets may negatively affect our operating results. In the past we have expanded our modular operations into new geographies and states. There are risks inherent in the undertaking of such expansion, including the risk of revenue from the business in any new markets not meeting our expectations, higher than expected costs in entering these new markets, risk associated with compliance with applicable state and local laws and regulations, response by competitors and unanticipated consequences of expansion. In addition, expansion into new markets may be affected by local economic and market conditions. Expansion of our operations into new markets will require a significant amount of attention from our management, a commitment of financial resources and will require us to add qualified management in these markets, which may negatively impact our operating results. We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts. These laws and regulations expose us to business volatility and risks, including government budgeting cycles and appropriations, potential early termination of contracts, procurement regulations, governmental policy shifts, audits, investigations, sanctions and penalties. Furthermore, these laws and regulations make these government contracts more favorable to government entities than other third parties and any changes in these laws and regulations, or our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business. McGrath derives a portion of its revenues from contracts with U.S. federal government entities, government prime contractors, state entities and local entities, including school districts. Contracts with government entities are subject to budgetary constraints, and our continued performance under our contracts with these agencies and their prime contractors, or award of additional contracts from these agencies or their prime contractors, could be jeopardized by spending reductions or budget cutbacks at these agencies. Such contracts are also subject to unique laws and regulations, and the adoption of new laws or regulations relating to government contracting or changes to existing laws or regulations. New laws, regulations or procurement requirements, or changes to current ones, can significantly increase our costs and risks and reduce our profitability. In addition, any failure on the part of the company to comply with applicable government contract laws and regulations might result in administrative penalties or even in the termination or suspension of these contracts and as a result, the loss of the related revenues, which would harm our business. Furthermore, the laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. For example, many government contracts contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts such as clauses that allow government entities not to perform on contractual obligations in the case of a lack of fiscal funding. Also, in the educational markets we serve, we are able to utilize “piggyback” contracts in marketing our products and services and ultimately to book business. The term “piggyback” contract refers to contracts for portable classrooms or other products entered into by public school districts following a formal bid process that allows for the use of the same contract terms and conditions with the successful vendor by other public school districts. As a result, “piggyback” contracts allow us to more readily book orders from our government customers, primarily public school districts, and to reduce the administrative expense associated with booking these orders. The governmental statutes and regulations that allow for use of “piggyback” contracts are subject to change or elimination in their entirety. A change in the manner of - 23 - use or the elimination of “piggyback” contracts would likely negatively impact our ability to book new business from these government customers and could cause our administrative expenses related to processing these orders to increase significantly. In addition, any failure to comply with these laws and regulations might result in administrative penalties or even in the suspension of these contracts and as a result, the loss of the related revenues which would harm our business and results from operations. Seasonality of our educational business may have adverse consequences for our business. A significant portion of the modular sale and rental revenues is derived from the educational market. Typically, during each calendar year, our highest numbers of classrooms are shipped for rental and sale orders during the second and third quarters for delivery and installation prior to the start of the upcoming school year. The majority of classrooms shipped in the second and third quarters have rental start dates during the third quarter, thereby making the fourth quarter the first full quarter of rental revenues recognized for these transactions. Although this is the historical seasonality of our business, it is subject to change or may not meet our expectations, which may have adverse consequences for our business. We face strong competition in our modular building markets and we may not be able to effectively compete. The modular building leasing industry is highly competitive in our states of operation and we expect it to remain so. The competitive market in which we operate may prevent us from raising rental fees or sales prices to pass any increased costs on to our customers. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including equipment availability, quality, price, service, reliability, appearance, functionality and delivery terms. We may experience pricing pressures in our areas of operation in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing prices. Some of our competitors in the modular building leasing industry, notably WillScot Mobile Mini Holdings Corp, have a greater range of products and services, greater financial and marketing resources, larger customer bases, and greater name recognition than we have. These combined competitors may be better able to respond to changes in the relocatable modular building market, to finance acquisitions, to fund internal growth and to compete for market share, any of which could harm our business. We may not be able to quickly redeploy modular units returning from leases, which could negatively affect our financial performance and our ability to expand, or utilize, our rental fleet. As of December 31, 2022, 63% of our modular portfolio had equipment on rent for periods exceeding the original committed term. Generally, when a customer continues to rent the modular units beyond the contractual term, the equipment rents on a month-to-month basis. If a significant number of our rented modular units were returned during a short period of time, particularly those units that are rented on a month-to-month basis, a large supply of units would need to be remarketed. Our failure to effectively remarket a large influx of units returning from leases could negatively affect our financial performance and our ability to continue expanding our rental fleet. In addition, if returned units stay off rent for an extended period of time, we may incur additional costs to securely store and maintain them. Significant increases in raw material and labor costs could increase our acquisition cost of new modular rental units and repair and maintenance costs of our fleet, which would increase our operating costs and harm our profitability. We incur labor costs and purchase raw materials, including lumber, siding and roofing and other products to perform periodic repairs, modifications and refurbishments to maintain physical conditions of our modular units. The volume, timing and mix of maintenance and repair work on our rental equipment may vary quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. Generally, increases in labor and raw material costs will also increase the acquisition cost of new modular units and increase the repair and maintenance costs of our fleet. We also maintain a fleet of service trucks and use subcontractor companies for the delivery, set-up, return delivery and dismantle of modulars for our customers. We rely on our subcontractor service companies to meet customer demands for timely shipment and return, and the loss or inadequate number of subcontractor service companies may cause prices to increase, while negatively impacting our reputation and operating performance. During periods of rising prices for labor, raw materials or fuel, and in particular, when the prices increase rapidly or to levels significantly higher than normal, we may incur significant increases in our acquisition costs for new modular units and incur higher operating costs that we may not be able to recoup from our customers, which would reduce our profitability. Failure by third parties to manufacture our products timely or properly may harm our reputation and financial condition. We are dependent on third parties to manufacture our products even though we are able to purchase products from a variety of third-party suppliers. Mobile Modular purchases new modulars from various manufacturers who build to Mobile Modular’s design specifications. With the exception of Enviroplex, none of the principal suppliers are affiliated with the Company. During 2022, Mobile Modular purchased 30% of its modular product from one manufacturer. The Company believes that the loss of any of its primary manufacturers of modulars could have an adverse effect on its operations since Mobile Modular could experience higher prices and longer delivery lead times for modular product until other manufacturers were able to increase their production capacity. - 24 - Failure to properly design, manufacture, repair and maintain the modular product may result in impairment charges, potential litigation and reduction of our operating results and cash flows. We estimate the useful life of the modular product to be 18 years with a residual value of 50%. However, proper design, manufacture, repairs and maintenance of the modular product during our ownership is required for the product to reach the estimated useful life of 18 years with a residual value of 50%. If we do not appropriately manage the design, manufacture, repair and maintenance of our modular product, or otherwise delay or defer such repair or maintenance, we may be required to incur impairment charges for equipment that is beyond economic repair costs or incur significant capital expenditures to acquire new modular product to serve demand. In addition, such failures may result in personal injury or property damage claims, including claims based on presence of mold, and termination of leases or contracts by customers. Costs of contract performance, potential litigation, and profits lost from termination could accordingly reduce our future operating results and cash flows. Our warranty costs may increase and warranty claims could damage our reputation and negatively impact our revenues and operating income. Sales of new relocatable modular buildings not manufactured by us are typically covered by warranties provided by the manufacturer of the products sold. We provide ninety-day warranties on certain modular sales of used rental units and one-year warranties on equipment manufactured by our Enviroplex subsidiary. Historically, our warranty costs have not been significant, and we monitor the quality of our products closely. If a defect were to arise in the installation of our equipment at the customer’s facilities or in the equipment acquired from our suppliers or by our Enviroplex subsidiary, we may experience increased warranty claims. Such claims could disrupt our sales operations, damage our reputation and require costly repairs or other remedies, negatively impacting revenues and operating income. SPECIFIC RISKS RELATED TO OUR ELECTRONIC TEST EQUIPMENT BUSINESS SEGMENT: Market risk and cyclical downturns in the industries using test equipment may result in periods of low demand for our product resulting in excess inventory, impairment charges and reduction of our operating results and cash flows. TRS-RenTelco’s revenues are derived from the rental and sale of general purpose and communications test equipment to a broad range of companies, from Fortune 500 to middle and smaller market companies, in the aerospace, defense, communications, manufacturing and semiconductor industries. Electronic test equipment rental and sales revenues are primarily affected by the business activity within these industries related to research and development, manufacturing, and communication infrastructure installation and maintenance. Historically, these industries have been cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns, which can have a material adverse impact on the industry’s demand for equipment, including our rental electronic test equipment. In addition, the severity and length of any downturn in an industry may also affect overall access to capital, which could adversely affect our customers and result in excess inventory and impairment charges. During periods of reduced and declining demand for test equipment, we are exposed to additional receivable risk from non-payment and may need to rapidly align our cost structure with prevailing market conditions, which may negatively impact our operating results and cash flows. Seasonality of our electronic test equipment business may impact quarterly results. Generally, rental activity declines in the fourth quarter month of December and the first quarter months of January and February. These months may have lower rental activity due to holiday closures, particularly by larger companies, inclement weather and its impact on various field related communications equipment rentals, and companies’ operational recovery from holiday closures which may impact the start-up of new projects coming online in the first quarter. These seasonal factors historically have impacted quarterly results in each year’s first and fourth quarter, but we are unable to predict how such factors may impact future periods. Our rental test equipment may become obsolete or may no longer be supported by a manufacturer, which could result in an impairment charge. Electronic test equipment is characterized by changing technology and evolving industry standards that may render our existing equipment obsolete through new product introductions, or enhancements, before the end of its anticipated useful life, causing us to incur impairment charges. We must anticipate and keep pace with the introduction of new hardware, software and networking technologies and acquire equipment that will be marketable to our current and prospective customers. Additionally, some manufacturers of our equipment may be acquired or cease to exist, resulting in a future lack of support for equipment purchased from those manufacturers. This could result in the remaining useful life becoming shorter, causing us to incur an impairment charge. We monitor our manufacturers’ capacity to support their products and the introduction of new technologies, and we acquire equipment that will be marketable to our current and prospective customers. However, any prolonged economic downturn could result in unexpected bankruptcies or reduced support from our manufacturers. Failure to properly select, manage and respond to - 25 - the technological needs of our customers and changes to our products through their technology life cycle may cause certain electronic test equipment to become obsolete, resulting in impairment charges, which may negatively impact operating results and cash flows. If we do not effectively compete in the rental equipment market, our operating results will be materially and adversely affected. The electronic test equipment rental business is characterized by intense competition from several competitors, including Electro Rent Corporation, Continental Resources and TestEquity, some of which may have access to greater financial and other resources than we do. Although no single competitor holds a dominant market share, we face competition from these established entities and new entrants in the market. We believe that we anticipate and keep pace with the introduction of new products and acquire equipment that will be marketable to our current and prospective customers. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including product availability, price, service and reliability. Some of our competitors may offer similar equipment for lease, rental or sale at lower prices and may offer more extensive servicing, or financing options. Failure to adequately forecast the adoption of, and demand for, new or existing products may cause us not to meet our customers’ equipment requirements and may materially and adversely affect our operating results. If we are not able to obtain equipment at favorable rates, there could be a material adverse effect on our operating results and reputation. The majority of our rental equipment portfolio is comprised of general purpose test and measurement instruments purchased from leading manufacturers such as Keysight Technologies, Rhode & Schwarz and Tektronix, a division of Fortive Corporation. We depend on purchasing equipment from these manufacturers and suppliers for use as our rental equipment. If, in the future, we are not able to purchase necessary equipment from one or more of these suppliers on favorable terms, we may not be able to meet our customers’ demands in a timely manner or for a rental rate that generates a profit. If this should occur, we may not be able to secure necessary equipment from an alternative source on acceptable terms and our business and reputation may be materially and adversely affected. If we are not able to anticipate and mitigate the risks associated with operating internationally, there could be a material adverse effect on our operating results. Currently, total foreign country customers and operations account for less than 10% of the Company’s revenues. In recent years some of our customers have expanded their international operations faster than domestic operations, and this trend may continue. Over time, the amount of our international business may increase if we focus on international market opportunities. Operating in foreign countries subjects the Company to additional risks, any of which may adversely impact our future operating results, including: Unfavorable currency exchange rates may negatively impact our financial results in U.S. dollar terms. We receive revenues in Canadian dollars from our business activities in Canada. Conducting business in currencies other than U.S. dollars subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. If the currency exchange rates change unfavorably, the value of net receivables we receive in foreign currencies and later convert to U.S. dollars after the unfavorable change would be diminished. This could have a negative impact on our reported operating results. We currently do not engage in hedging strategies to mitigate this risk. - 26 - ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES. The Company’s corporate and administrative offices are located in Livermore, California in approximately 26,000 square feet. At December 31, 2022, the Company’s four reportable business segments conducted operations from the following locations: Mobile Modular – Mobile Modular operates from 14 owned and 40 leased locations. Our largest owned facilities include seven inventory centers, at which relocatable modular buildings and storage containers are displayed, refurbished and stored: Livermore, California (137 acres in the San Francisco Bay Area), Mira Loma, California (79 acres in the Los Angeles area), Pasadena, Texas (50 acres in the Houston area), Grand Prairie, Texas (43 acres in the Dallas area), Auburndale, Florida (123 acres in the Orlando area), Arcade, Georgia (48 acres in the Atlanta area), Fredericksburg, Virginia (68 acres in the Washington D.C. area). The inventory centers conduct rental and sales operations from modular buildings, serving as working models of the Company’s modular product. TRS-RenTelco – Electronic test equipment rental and sales operations are conducted from a 117,000 square foot leased facility in Grapevine, Texas (Dallas area) and a sales office in Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Quebec (Montreal, Canada area). Adler Tanks – Adler Tanks operated from 14 owned and 34 leased locations, with branch offices serving the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, Southeast, Southwest and West. The leased locations have remaining lease terms ranging from one to three years, or are leased on a month to month basis. Enviroplex – The Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Enviroplex, manufactures modular buildings used primarily as classrooms in California from its 108,000 square foot facility in Stockton, California (San Francisco Bay Area). ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. The Company is involved in various lawsuits and routine claims arising out of the normal course of its business. The Company maintains insurance coverage for its operations and employees with appropriate aggregate, per occurrence and deductible limits as the Company reasonably determines necessary or prudent with current operations and historical experience. The major policies include coverage for property, general liability, cyber, auto, directors and officers, health, and workers’ compensation insurances. In the opinion of management, the ultimate amount of liability not covered by insurance, if any, under any pending litigation and claims, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position or operating results of the Company. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES. Not Applicable PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company’s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth in this section as well as those discussed under Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this document. This discussion should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes thereto set forth in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Results of Operations General The Company, incorporated in 1979, is a leading rental provider of relocatable modular buildings for classroom and office space, electronic test equipment for general purpose and communications needs, and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes. The Company’s primary emphasis is on equipment rentals. At December 31, 2022 the Company was comprised of four reportable business segments: (1) its modular building and portable storage container rental segment (“Mobile Modular”); (2) its electronic test equipment rental segment (“TRS-RenTelco”); (3) its containment solutions for the storage of hazardous and non-hazardous liquids and solids segment (“Adler Tanks”); and (4) its classroom manufacturing segment selling modular buildings used primarily as classrooms in California (“Enviroplex”). In 2022, Mobile Modular, TRS-RenTelco, Adler Tanks and Enviroplex contributed 64%, 25%, 10% and 1%, respectively, of the Company’s income before provision for taxes (the equivalent of “pre-tax income”), compared to 63%, 28%, 5% and 4%, respectively, for 2021. The Company generates its revenues primarily from the rental of its equipment on operating leases with sales of equipment occurring in the normal course of business. The Company requires significant capital outlay to purchase its rental inventory and recovers its investment through rental and sales revenues. Rental revenue and certain other service revenues negotiated as part of the lease agreements with customers and related costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the lease. Sales revenue and related costs are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment to the customers. Sales revenues are less predictable and can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer demands and requirements. Generally, rental revenues less cash operating costs recover the equipment’s capitalized cost in a shorter period of time relative to the equipment’s potential rental life and when sold, sale proceeds are usually above its net book value. The Company’s rental operations include rental and rental related services revenues which comprised approximately 79% of the Company’s total revenues in 2022 and for the three years ended December 31, 2022. Over the past three years, modulars, electronic test equipment and tanks and boxes comprised approximately 60%, 24% and 16%, respectively, of the cumulative rental operations revenues. The Company’s direct costs of rental operations include depreciation of rental equipment, rental related service costs, impairment of rental equipment, and other direct costs of rental operations (which include direct labor, supplies, repairs, insurance, property taxes, license fees and amortization of certain lease costs). The Company sells modular, electronic test equipment and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes that are new, or previously rented. The Company’s Enviroplex subsidiary manufactures and sells modular classrooms. The renting and selling of some modular equipment requires a dealer’s license, which the Company has obtained from the appropriate governmental agencies. Sales and other revenues of modulars, electronic test equipment and tanks and boxes have comprised approximately 21% of the Company’s consolidated revenues in 2022 and for the three years ended December 31, 2022. Over the past three years, modulars, electronic test equipment and tanks and boxes comprised approximately 79%, 19% and 2% of sales and other revenues, respectively. The Company’s cost of sales includes the carrying value of the equipment sold and the direct costs associated with the equipment sold such as delivery, installation, modifications and related site work. The rental and sale of modulars to public school districts comprised 19%, 21% and 23% of the Company’s consolidated rental and sales revenues for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. (For more information, see “Item 1. Business – Relocatable Modular Buildings – Classroom Rentals and Sales to Public Schools (K-12)” above.) Selling and administrative expenses primarily include personnel and benefit costs, which includes share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, bad debt expense, advertising costs, and professional service fees. The Company believes that sharing of common facilities, financing, senior management, and operating and accounting systems by all of the Company’s operations, results in an efficient use of overhead. Historically, the Company’s operating margins have been impacted favorably to the extent its costs and expenses are leveraged over a large installed customer base. However, there can be no assurance as to the Company’s ability to maintain a large installed customer base or ability to sustain its historical operating margins. - 29 - Recent Developments Adler Tanks Divestiture and Vesta Modular Acquisition On February 1, 2023, the Company completed an equity sale agreement with Ironclad Environmental Solutions, Inc. (""Ironclad"") to sell its Adler Tanks business for a sale price of $265 million, subject to certain adjustments. Concurrently, the Company completed a stock purchase agreement providing for the purchase of Vesta Modular for a purchase price of $400 million, subject to certain adjustments. The divestiture of the Company's Adler Tanks business and the stock purchase of Vesta Modular, represents the Company's strategic shift to concentrate its operations on its core modular and storage businesses. The Company believes that this strategic shift will provide for accelerated growth of the modular business, develop cost and revenue synergies, and increase the proportion of longer-term rental revenue contracts. The details of each transaction are more fully described below. Dividends In February 2023, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.465 per common share for the quarter ending March 31, 2023, an increase of 2% over the prior year’s comparable quarter. COVID-19 The outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, which began in December 2019, has continued to spread globally including to every state in the United States. The Center for Disease Control (""CDC"") and World Health Organization (""WHO"") recognized this outbreak as a pandemic, which has caused shutdowns to businesses and cities worldwide while disrupting supply chains, business operations, travel, consumer confidence and business sentiment. The Company has taken a number of precautionary health and safety measures to safeguard its employees and customers, while maintaining business continuity. The Company has implemented remote work policies and enhanced cleaning and hygiene protocols in all of its facilities, products and vehicles. The Company is continuing to monitor and assess orders issued by federal, state and local governments to ensure compliance with evolving COVID-19 guidelines. The Company also continues to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on its existing customers who themselves may be impacted by governmental shutdowns and other impacts due to the governmental orders. While the Company has not seen a significant impact from COVID-19 in the financial results for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 as set forth in the below sections discussing the results of operations for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the Company is currently unable to determine or predict the full nature, duration or scope of the overall impact the COVID-19 pandemic and related business and operational pressures will have on its business, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. The Company will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter its business operations as may be required by federal, state or local authorities or that the Company determines are in the best interests of employees, customers and shareholders. - 30 - Percentage of Revenue Table The following table sets forth for the periods indicated the results of operations as a percentage of the Company’s total revenues and the percentage of changes in the amount of such of items as compared to the amount in the indicated prior period: Percent of Total Revenues Percent Change Three Years Year Ended December 31, 2022 over 2021 over 2022–2020 2022 2021 2020 2021 2020 Revenues Rental 62 % 62 % 63 % 61 % 17 % 11 % Rental related services 17 17 16 17 25 6 Rental operations 79 79 79 78 19 10 Sales 20 20 20 22 20 1 Other 1 1 1 — 28 (6 ) Total revenues 100 100 100 100 19 8 Costs and expenses Direct costs of rental operations Depreciation of rental equipment 14 13 15 15 5 7 Rental related services 12 12 12 12 21 9 Other 15 16 15 13 28 23 Total direct costs of rental operations 41 41 42 40 18 13 Cost of sales 13 13 13 14 19 (3 ) Total costs 54 54 55 54 18 9 Gross profit 46 46 45 46 20 7 Selling and administrative expenses 23 23 24 21 15 21 Income from operations 23 23 21 25 25 (6 ) Other expense: Interest expense 2 2 2 2 45 19 Income before provision for income taxes 21 20 20 23 23 (8 ) Provision for income taxes 5 5 5 5 9 7 Net income 16 % 16 % 15 % 18 % 28 % (12 )% - 31 - Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2022 Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2021 Overview Consolidated revenues in 2022 increased to $733.8 million from $616.8 million in 2021.

The Company presents Adjusted EBITDA as a financial measure as management believes it provides useful information to investors regarding the Company’s liquidity and financial condition and because management, as well as the Company’s lenders, use this measure in evaluating the performance of the Company. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a supplement to GAAP measures to further evaluate period-to-period operating performance, compliance with financial covenants in the Company’s revolving lines of credit and senior notes and the Company’s ability to meet future capital expenditure and working capital requirements. Management believes the exclusion of non-cash charges, including share-based compensation, and transaction costs is useful in measuring the Company’s cash available for operations and performance of the Company. Because management finds Adjusted EBITDA useful, the Company believes its investors will also find Adjusted EBITDA useful in evaluating the Company’s performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, cash flows, or other consolidated income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of the Company’s profitability or liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA is not in accordance with or an alternative for GAAP and may be different from non−GAAP measures used by other companies. Unlike EBITDA, which may be used by other companies or investors, Adjusted EBITDA does not include share-based compensation charges and transaction costs. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is of limited use in that it does not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and does not accurately reflect real cash flow. In addition, other companies may not use Adjusted EBITDA or may use other non-GAAP measures, limiting the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA for purposes of comparison. The Company’s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that the Company will not incur expenses that are the same as or similar to the adjustments in this presentation. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA should only be used to evaluate the Company’s results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. The Company compensates for the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA by relying upon GAAP results to gain a complete picture of the Company’s performance. Because Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure, as defined by the SEC, the Company includes in the tables below reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources”). These instruments contain financial covenants requiring the Company to not: At December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with each of these aforementioned covenants. There are no anticipated trends that the Company is aware of that would indicate non-compliance with these covenants, though, significant deterioration in our financial performance could impact the Company's ability to comply with these covenants. - 47 - Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company’s rental businesses are capital intensive and generate significant cash flows. Cash flows for the Company in 2022 as compared to 2021 are summarized as follows: Cash Flows from Operating Activities: The Company’s operations provided net cash flow of $194.4 million for 2022 as compared to $195.7 million in 2021. The comparable net cash provided by operating activities was primarily the result of lower deferred income taxes and increased gain on sale of used rental equipment, partly offset by higher deferred income and other balance sheet changes. Cash Flows from Investing Activities: Net cash used in investing activities was $131.4 million for 2022 as compared to $351.7 million in 2021. The $220.3 million decrease in net cash used was primarily due to the $285.6 million acquisition of Design Space and Kitchens to Go in 2021, partly offset by $73.5 million higher purchases of rental equipment in 2022. Cash Flows from Financing Activities: Net cash used in financing activities was $63.5 million in 2022, compared to net cash provided of $156.2 million in 2021. The change in net cash during 2022 was primarily due to reduced borrowings under bank lines of credit and note purchase agreements, as the borrowings in 2021 were the result of funding the Design Space and Kitchens to Go acquisitions, and the $60.0 million principal payment of Series C senior notes in 2022 compared to the $60.0 net borrowings under the note purchase agreement in 2021. Significant capital expenditures are required to maintain and grow the Company’s rental assets. During the last three years, the Company has financed its working capital and capital expenditure requirements through cash flows from operations, proceeds from the sale of rental equipment and from borrowings. Sales occur routinely as a normal part of the Company’s rental businesses. However, these sales can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer requirements and funding. Although the net proceeds received from sales may fluctuate from period to period, the Company believes its liquidity will not be adversely impacted from lower sales in any given year because it believes it has the ability to increase its bank borrowings, offer additional notes and conserve its cash in the future by reducing the amount of cash it uses to purchase rental equipment, pay dividends, or repurchase the Company’s common stock. As the following table indicates, cash flow provided by operating activities and proceeds from sales of used rental equipment have been greater than rental equipment purchases over the past three years. Funding of Rental Asset Growth (amounts in thousands) Year Ended December 31, Three Year 2022 2021 2020 Totals Cash provided by operating activities $ 194,432 $ 195,743 $ 180,504 $ 570,679 Proceeds from sales of used rental equipment 73,879 57,337 47,052 178,268 Cash available for purchase of rental equipment 268,311 253,080 227,556 748,947 Purchases of rental equipment (187,689 ) (114,145 ) (86,329 ) (388,163 ) Cash available for other purposes $ 80,622 $ 138,935 $ 141,227 $ 360,784 In addition to increasing its rental assets, the Company has periodically made acquisitions of businesses and business assets. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company transacted a total of $292.2 million in acquisition related costs. There were no acquisitions of businesses completed during 2022. The Company had other capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment of $17.6 million in 2022, $2.7 million in 2021 and $13.7 million in 2020, and has used cash to provide returns to its shareholders in the form of cash dividends. The Company paid cash dividends of $44.3 million, $42.2 million and $39.8 million in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Company has in the past made purchases of shares of its common stock from time to time in over-the-counter market (NASDAQ) transactions, through privately negotiated, large block transactions and through a share repurchase plan, in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In August 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase 2,000,000 shares of the Company's outstanding common stock (the “Repurchase Plan”). The amount and time of the specific repurchases are subject to prevailing market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors, including management’s discretion. All shares repurchased by the Company are canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares of common stock. There can be no assurance that any authorized shares will be repurchased and the repurchase program may be modified, extended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. There were no shares of common stock repurchased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. As of December 31, 2022, 1,309,805 shares remain authorized for repurchase under the Repurchase Plan. - 48 - Unsecured Revolving Lines of Credit On July 15, 2022, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender, L/C Issuer and lender, and other lenders named therein (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility provides for a $650.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (which may be further increased to $950.0 million by adding one or more tranches of term loans and/or increasing the aggregate revolving commitments), which includes a $40.0 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a $20.0 million sublimit for swingline loans. The proceeds of the Credit Facility are available to be used for general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions. The Credit Facility permits the Company’s existing indebtedness to remain, which includes the Company’s $20.0 million Treasury Sweep Note due July 15, 2027, the Company’s existing senior notes issued pursuant to the Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement with Prudential Investment Management, Inc., dated as of April 21, 2011 (as amended): (i) the $60.0 million aggregate outstanding principal of notes issued November 5, 2015 which were repaid on November 5, 2022, (ii) the $40.0 million aggregate outstanding principal of notes issued March 17, 2021 and due March 17, 2028, and (iii) the $60.0 million aggregate outstanding principal of notes issued June 16, 2021 and due June 16, 2026. In addition, the Company may incur additional senior note indebtedness in an aggregate amount not to exceed $250.0 million. The Credit Facility matures on July 15, 2027 and replaced the Company’s prior $420.0 million credit facility dated March 31, 2020 with Bank of America, N.A., as agent, as amended. All obligations outstanding under the prior credit facility as of the date of the Credit Facility were refinanced by the Credit Facility on July 15, 2022. On August 19, 2022, the Company entered into an amended and restated Credit Facility Letter Agreement and a Credit Line Note in favor of MUFG Union Bank, N.A., which provides for a $20.0 million line of credit facility related to its cash management services (“Sweep Service Facility”). The Sweep Service Facility matures on the earlier of July 15, 2027, or the date the Company ceases to utilize MUFG Union Bank, N.A. for its cash management services. The Sweep Service Facility replaced the Company’s prior $12.0 million sweep service facility, dated as of March 30, 2020. At December 31, 2022, under the Credit Facility and Sweep Service Facility, the Company had unsecured lines of credit that permit it to borrow up to $650.0 million of which $313.8 million was outstanding. The Credit Facility contains financial covenants requiring the Company to not (all defined terms used below not otherwise defined herein have the meaning assigned to such terms in the Amended Credit Facility): At December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with each of the aforementioned covenants. There are no anticipated trends that the Company is aware of that would indicate non-compliance with these covenants, although significant deterioration in our financial performance could impact the Company’s ability to comply with these covenants. Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement On March 31, 2020, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement (the “Note Purchase Agreement”) with PGIM, Inc. (“PGIM”) and the holders of Series B and Series C Notes previously issued pursuant to the Prior NPA, among the Company and the other parties to the Note Purchase Agreement. The Note Purchase Agreement amended and restated, and superseded in its entirety, the Prior NPA. Pursuant to the Prior NPA, the Company issued (i) $40.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.68% Series B Senior Notes, which were repaid on March 17, 2021, and (ii) $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.84% Series C Senior Notes, which were repaid on November 5, 2022, to which the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement shall apply. In addition, pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, the Company may authorize the issuance and sale of additional senior notes (the “Shelf Notes”) in the aggregate principal amount of (x) $250 million minus (y) the amount of other notes (such as the Series D Senior Notes and Series E Senior Notes, each defined below) then outstanding, to be dated the date of issuance thereof, to mature, in case of each Shelf Note so issued, no more than 15 years after the date of original issuance thereof, to have an average life, in the case of each Shelf Note so issued, of no more than 15 years after the date of original issuance thereof, to bear interest on the unpaid balance thereof from the date thereof at the rate per annum, and to have such other particular terms, as shall be set forth, in the case of each Shelf Note so issued, in accordance with the Note Purchase Agreement. Shelf Notes may be issued and sold from time to time at the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors and in such amounts as the Board of Directors may determine, subject to prospective purchasers’ agreement to purchase the Shelf Notes. The Company will sell the Shelf Notes directly to such purchasers. The full net proceeds of each Shelf Note will be used in the manner described in the applicable Request for Purchase with respect to such Shelf Note. 2.57% Senior Notes Due in 2028 - 49 - On March 17, 2021, the Company issued and sold to the purchasers $40 million aggregate principal amount of 2.57% Series D Notes (the “Series D Senior Notes”) pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement, dated March 31, 2020 (the “Note Purchase Agreement”), among the Company, PGIM, Inc. and the noteholders party thereto. The Series D Senior Notes are an unsecured obligation of the Company and bear interest at a rate of 2.57% per annum and mature on March 17, 2028. Interest on the Series D Senior Notes is payable semi-annually beginning on September 17, 2021 and continuing thereafter on March 17 and September 17 of each year until maturity. The principal balance is due when the notes mature on March 17, 2028. The full net proceeds from the Series D Senior Notes were used to pay off the Company’s $40 million Series B Senior Notes. At December 31, 2022, the principal balance outstanding under the Series D Senior Notes was $40.0 million. 2.35% Senior Notes Due in 2026 On June 16, 2021, the Company issued and sold to the purchasers $60 million aggregate principal amount of 2.35% Series E Notes (the ""Series E Notes"") pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement, dated March 31, 2020 (the “Note Purchase Agreement”), among the Company, PGIM, Inc. and the noteholders party thereto. The Series E Senior Notes are an unsecured obligation of the Company and bear interest at a rate of 2.35% per annum and mature on June 16, 2026. Interest on the Series E Senior Notes is payable semi-annually beginning on December 16, 2021 and continuing thereafter on June 16 and December 16 of each year until maturity. The principal balance is due when the notes mature on June 16, 2026. The full net proceeds from the Series E Senior Notes were used to pay down the Company’s credit facility. At December 31, 2022, the principal balance outstanding under the Series E Senior Notes was $60.0 million. Among other restrictions, the Note Purchase Agreement, which has superseded in its entirety the Prior NPA, under which the Series C Senior Notes, Series D Senior Notes and Series E Senior Notes were sold, contains financial covenants requiring the Company to not (all defined terms used below not otherwise defined herein have the meaning assigned to such terms in the Note Purchase Agreement): At December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with each of the aforementioned covenants. There are no anticipated trends that the Company is aware of that would indicate non-compliance with these covenants, although significant deterioration in our financial performance could impact the Company’s ability to comply with these covenants. Although no assurance can be given, the Company believes it will continue to be able to negotiate general bank lines of credit and issue senior notes adequate to meet capital requirements not otherwise met by operational cash flows and proceeds from sales of rental equipment. Furthermore, the Company believes it has the financial resources to weather any short-term impacts of COVID-19. However, the Company has limited insight into the extent to which its business may be impacted by COVID-19, and there are many uncertainties, including how long and how severely the Company will be impacted. An extended and severe impact may materially and adversely affect the Company’s future operations, financial position and liquidity. Contractual Obligations and Commitments At December 31, 2022, the Company’s material contractual obligations and commitments consisted of outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities expiring in 2027, outstanding amounts under our 2.35% and 2.57% senior notes due in 2026 and 2028, respectively, and operating leases for facilities. The operating lease amounts exclude property taxes and insurance. The table below provides a summary of the Company’s contractual obligations and reflects expected payments due as of December 31, 2022 and does not reflect changes that could arise after that date. Payments Due by Period (dollar amounts in thousands) Total Within 1 Year Within 2 to 3 Years Within 4 to 5 Years More than 5 Years Revolving lines of credit $ 313,775 $ — $ — $ 313,775 $ — 2.57% Series D senior notes due in 2028 45,654 1,028 2,056 2,056 40,514 2.35% Series E senior notes due in 2026 64,935 1,410 2,820 60,705 — Operating leases for facilities 11,111 4,417 5,558 1,136 — Total contractual obligations $ 435,475 $ 6,855 $ 10,434 $ 377,672 $ 40,514 - 50 - The Company believes that its needs for working capital and capital expenditures through 2023 and beyond will be adequately met by operating cash flow, proceeds from the sale of rental equipment, and bank borrowings. Please see the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows on page 62 for a more detailed presentation of the sources and uses of the Company's cash. Critical Accounting Policies The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. A summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies are in Note 1 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The Company determined its critical accounting policies by considering those policies that involve the most complex or subjective assumptions, estimates, and/or judgement. Material changes in these assumptions, estimates or judgments could have the potential to have a material impact on the Company’s financial results. The Company has identified below the accounting policies that it believes could potentially have a material impact on operating results if a change in assumption, estimate and/or judgment were to occur. Depreciation - The estimated useful lives and estimated residual values used for rental equipment are based on the Company’s experience as to the economic useful life and sale value of its products. Additionally, to the extent information is publicly available, the Company also compares its depreciation policies to other companies with similar rental products for reasonableness. The lives and residual values of rental equipment are subject to periodic evaluation. For modular equipment, external factors to consider may include, but are not limited to, changes in legislation, regulations, building codes, local permitting, and supply or demand. Internal factors for modulars may include, but are not limited to, change in equipment specifications, condition of equipment, or maintenance policies. For electronic test equipment, external factors to consider may include, but are not limited to, technological advances, changes in manufacturers’ selling prices, and supply or demand. Internal factors for electronic test equipment may include, but are not limited to, change in equipment specifications, condition of equipment, or maintenance policies. For liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes, external factors to consider may include, but are not limited to, changes in Federal and State legislation, the types of materials stored and the frequency of movements and uses. Internal factors for liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes may include, but are not limited to, change in equipment specifications and maintenance policies. To the extent that the useful lives of all of our rental equipment were to decrease or increase by one year, the Company estimates the annual depreciation expense would increase or decrease by approximately $6 million. If the estimated residual values of all of our rental equipment were to change one percentage point, the Company estimates the annual depreciation expense would change by approximately $1 million. Any changes in depreciation expense as a result of a change in useful lives or residual values would result in a proportional increase or decrease in the gross profit the Company would recognize upon the ultimate sale of the equipment. Maintenance, repair and refurbishment - Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The direct material and labor costs of value-added additions or major refurbishment of modular buildings are capitalized to the extent the refurbishment significantly improves the quality and adds value or life to the equipment. Judgment is involved as to when these costs should be capitalized. The Company’s policies narrowly limit the capitalization of value-added items to specific additions such as portable storage office conversions, restrooms, sidewalls and ventilation upgrades. In addition, only major refurbishment costs incurred near the end of the estimated useful life of the rental equipment, which extend its useful life, and are subject to certain limitations, are capitalized. The Company capitalized $9 million in extended life or value added refurbishments in 2022. Changes in these policies to expense these costs as incurred could impact the Company’s financial results. Acquisition Accounting - The Company has made acquisitions of businesses in the past and records the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. Long-lived assets (primarily rental equipment), goodwill and other intangible assets generally represent the largest components of the Company’s acquisitions. Determining the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired can be judgmental in nature and can involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Rental equipment is valued utilizing either a cost, market or income approach, or a combination of certain of these methods, depending on the asset being valued and the availability of market or income data. The intangible assets acquired are primarily comprised of customer relationships, non-compete agreements and trade names. These assets are valued on an excess earnings or income approach based on projected cash flows. The estimated fair values of these intangible assets reflect various assumptions about revenue growth rates, operating margins, projected cash flows, discount rates, customer attrition rates, terminal values, useful lives and other prospective financial information. When appropriate, the Company’s estimates of the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired include assistance from independent third-party valuation firms. Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of the acquired business over the net of the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired, as well as the estimated life of the assets, can materially impact the Company’s financial results in periods subsequent - 51 - to the acquisition through depreciation and amortization, and in certain instances through impairment charges, if the asset becomes impaired in the future. As discussed below, we regularly review for impairments. Impairment of rental equipment - The carrying value of the Company’s rental equipment is its capitalized cost less accumulated depreciation. To the extent events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value cannot be recovered, an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carrying value to fair value. The Company evaluates the carrying value of rental equipment for impairment whenever events and circumstances have occurred that would indicate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable. Determining fair value includes estimates and judgments regarding the projected net cash flows considering current and future market conditions including assumptions regarding utilization, rental pricing, the condition of the equipment, the equipment’s expected remaining life and sale proceeds. Due to uncertainties inherent in the valuation process and market conditions, it is reasonably possible that actual results of operating and disposing of rental equipment could be materially different than current expectations. Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets - The Company’s goodwill is not amortized to expense, the Company assesses whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to complete quantitative impairment assessments. These impairment assessments occur annually, or more frequently if an event occurs, or circumstances change in the interim that would indicate that it was more likely than not the fair value had reduced below its carrying value. Application of the goodwill impairment assessment requires judgement including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, business projections including changes in pricing, rental and sale activity and costs, long term growth rates and discount rates. In 2022, 2021 and 2020 the Company performed qualitative assessments taking into consideration the market value of the Company, any changes in management, key personnel, strategy and any relevant macroeconomic conditions, concluding that the fair value of the reporting units substantially exceeded the respective reporting units carrying value, including goodwill. Intangible assets (other than goodwill) acquired are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. Definite lived intangibles are amortized over their expected useful lives, while indefinite lived intangibles are not amortized. The Company monitors conditions related to these assets to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining amortization period. The Company tests these assets for potential impairment annually and whenever management determines events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Revenue recognition: Lease revenue - Rental revenues from operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease for all operating segments. Rental billings for periods extending beyond period end are recorded as deferred income and are recognized in the period earned. Rental related services revenues are primarily associated with relocatable modular building and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes leases. For modular building leases, rental related services revenues for modifications, delivery, installation, dismantle and return delivery are lease related because the payments are considered minimum lease payments that are an integral part of the negotiated lease agreement with the customer. These revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain leases are accounted for as sales-type leases. For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment. Other revenues include interest income on sales-type leases and rental income on facility leases. Non-lease revenue - Sales revenue is recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment to customers. Certain leases are accounted for as sales-type leases. For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment. The Company typically recognizes non-lease related revenues at a point in time because the customer does not simultaneously consume the benefits of the Company’s promised goods and services, or performance obligations, and obtain control when delivery and installation are complete. For contracts that have multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in the contract based on the Company’s best estimate of the standalone selling prices of each distinct performance obligation in the contract. The standalone selling price is typically determined based upon the expected cost plus an estimated margin of each performance obligation. Judgment is involved in determining the performance obligations and standalone selling prices. To the extent actual results were to differ from these estimates, the timing of profit recognition could change and impact the Company’s financial results. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. The Company is exposed to cash flow and fair value risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to its 2.35% and 2.57% senior notes due in 2026 and 2028, respectively, and its revolving lines of credit. Weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at December 31, 2022. The estimate of fair value of the Company’s fixed rate debt is based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for bank loans with similar terms and average maturities.

The Company commenced the closure of its Indian operations during 2017. The Canadian operations of the Company subject it to foreign currency risks (i.e. the possibility that the financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates). Currently, the Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge its economic exposure with respect to assets, liabilities and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In 2022, the Company experienced minimal impact on net income due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Although there can be no assurances, given the size of the Canadian operations, the Company does not expect future foreign exchange gains and losses to be significant. The Company has no derivative financial instruments that expose the Company to significant market risk. - 53 - ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.

All other financial information in this report has been presented on a basis consistent with the information included in the financial statements. The Company’s management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company maintains a system of internal control that is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliable preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements, as well as to safeguard assets from unauthorized use or disposition. The Company’s system of internal control over financial reporting is embodied in the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. It sets the tone of our organization and includes factors such as integrity and ethical values. Our internal control over financial reporting is supported by formal policies and procedures, which are reviewed, modified and improved as changes occur in business conditions and operations. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed solely of outside directors, meets periodically with members of management and the independent auditors to review and discuss internal control over financial reporting, as well as accounting and financial reporting matters. The independent auditors report to the Audit Committee and accordingly have full and free access to the Audit Committee at any time.

62 - MCGRATH RENTCORP NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Organization McGrath RentCorp and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the “Company”) is a California corporation organized in 1979. The Company is a diversified business to business rental company with four rental divisions; relocatable modular buildings, portable storage containers, electronic test equipment and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes. Although the Company’s primary emphasis is on equipment rentals, sales of equipment occur in the normal course of business. At December 31, 2022, the Company was comprised of four reportable business segments: modular building and portable storage segment (“Mobile Modular”), electronic test equipment segment (“TRS-RenTelco”), containment solutions for the storage of hazardous and non-hazardous liquids and solids segment (“Adler Tanks”) and classroom manufacturing division selling modular classrooms in California (“Enviroplex”). Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of McGrath RentCorp and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Revenue Recognition Lease revenues - Rental revenues from operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease for all operating segments. Rental billings for periods extending beyond period end are recorded as deferred income and are recognized in the period earned. Rental related services revenues are primarily associated with relocatable modular building and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes leases. For modular building leases, rental related services revenues for modifications, delivery, installation, dismantle and return delivery are lease related because the payments are considered minimum lease payments that are an integral part of the negotiated lease agreement with the customer. These revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain leases are accounted for as sales-type leases. For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment. Other revenues include interest income on sales-type leases and rental income on facility leases. Non-lease revenues - Sales revenue is recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment to customers. Certain leases are accounted for as sales-type leases. For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment. Other revenue is recognized when earned and primarily includes interest income on sales-type leases, rental income on facility leases and certain logistics services. Sales taxes charged to customers are reported on a net basis and are excluded from revenues and expenses. Depreciation of Rental Equipment Rental equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis for financial reporting purposes and on an accelerated basis for income tax purposes. The costs of major refurbishment of relocatable modular buildings, portable storage containers and tanks and boxes are capitalized to the extent the refurbishment significantly adds value to, or extends the life of the equipment. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The estimated useful lives and residual values of the Company’s rental equipment used for financial reporting purposes are as follows: Relocatable modular buildings 18 years, 50 % residual value Relocatable modular accessories 3 to 18 years , no residual value Blast resistant and kitchen modules 20 years , no residual value Portable storage containers 25 years , 62.5 % residual value Electronic test equipment and accessories 1 to 8 years , no residual value Liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes and accessories 3 to 20 years , no residual value - 63 - Costs of Rental Related Services Costs of rental related services are primarily associated with relocatable modular building leases and liquid and solid containment tank and boxes. Modular building leases primarily consist of costs for services to be provided under the negotiated lease agreement for delivery, installation, modifications, skirting, additional site-related work, and dismantle and return delivery. Costs related to these services are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Costs of rental related services associated with liquid and solid containment solutions consists of costs of delivery, removal and cleaning of the tanks and boxes. These costs are recognized in the period the service is performed. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company evaluates the carrying value of rental equipment and identifiable definite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances have occurred that would indicate the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. A key element in determining the recoverability of long-lived assets is the Company’s outlook as to the future market conditions for its rental equipment. If the carrying amount is not fully recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carrying amount to fair value. The Company determines fair value based upon the condition of the rental equipment and the projected net cash flows from its rental and sale considering current market conditions. Goodwill and identifiable indefinite lived assets are evaluated for potential impairment annually or when circumstances indicate potential impairment may have occurred. Impairment losses, if any, are determined based upon the excess of carrying value over the estimated fair value of the asset. There were no impairments of long-lived assets during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Other Direct Costs of Rental Operations Other direct costs of rental operations include direct labor, supplies, repairs, insurance, property taxes, license fees, impairment of rental equipment and certain modular lease costs charged to customers in the negotiated rental rate, which are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Cost of Sales Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income includes the carrying value of the equipment sold and all direct costs associated with the sale. Warranty Reserves Sales of new relocatable modular buildings, portable storage containers, electronic test equipment and related accessories and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes not manufactured by the Company are typically covered by warranties provided by the manufacturer of the products sold. The Company typically provides limited 90 -day warranties for certain sales of used rental equipment and one-year warranties on equipment manufactured by Enviroplex. Although the Company’s policy is to provide reserves for warranties when required for specific circumstances, the Company has not found it necessary to establish such reserves to date as warranty costs have not been significant. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis for financial reporting purposes, and on an accelerated basis for income tax purposes. Depreciation expense for property, plant and equipment is included in “Selling and administrative expenses” and “Rental related services” in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. - 64 - Property, plant and equipment consist of the following: (dollar amounts in thousands) Estimated useful life December 31, in years 2022 2021 Land Indefinite $ 61,487 $ 54,428 Land improvements 20 – 50 65,451 59,633 Buildings 30 34,082 33,781 Furniture, office equipment and software 3 – 10 37,379 37,965 Vehicles and machinery 5 – 25 47,324 44,560 245,723 230,367 Less: accumulated depreciation ( 102,977 ) ( 98,333 ) 142,746 132,034 Construction in progress 1,199 3,291 $ 143,945 $ 135,325 Property, plant and equipment depreciation expense was $ 9.0 million, $ 8.9 million and $ 8.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Construction in progress at December 31, 2022 and 2021 consisted primarily of costs related to acquisition of land, land improvements and information technology upgrades. Capitalized Software Costs The Company capitalizes certain development costs incurred in connection with its internal use software. Costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as incurred. Once an application has reached the development stage, direct internal and external costs are capitalized until the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. These costs generally include external direct costs of materials and services consumed in the project and internal costs, such as payroll and benefits of those employees directly associated with the development of the software. Maintenance, training and post implementation costs are expensed as incurred. The Company also capitalizes costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality. Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and equipment. The Company capitalized less than $ 0.1 million and $ 0.2 million in internal use software during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Total advertising expenses were $ 5.0 million, $ 5.1 million and $ 3.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the effect of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are adjusted to the extent necessary to reflect tax rates expected to be in effect when temporary differences reverse. Adjustments may be required to deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities due to changes in tax laws and audit adjustments by tax authorities. A valuation allowance would be established if, based on the weight of available evidence, management believes that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a recorded deferred tax asset would not be realized in future periods. To the extent adjustments are required in any given period, the adjustments would be included within the “Provision for income taxes” in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Purchase prices of acquired businesses are allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based on the estimated fair values on the respective acquisition dates. Based on these values, the excess purchase prices over the fair value of the net assets acquired are allocated to goodwill. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, goodwill and trade name intangible assets which have indefinite lives totaled $ 138.2 million and $ 138.3 million, respectively. The Company assesses potential impairment of its goodwill and intangible assets when there is evidence that events or circumstances have occurred that would indicate the recovery of an asset’s carrying value is unlikely. The Company also assesses potential impairment of its goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives on an annual basis regardless of whether there is evidence of impairment. If indicators of impairment were to be present in intangible assets used in operations and future discounted cash flows - 65 - were not expected to be sufficient to recover the assets’ carrying amount, an impairment loss would be charged to expense in the period identified. The amount of an impairment loss would be recognized as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. Factors the Company considers important, which may cause impairment include, among others, significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired asset, negative industry or economic trends, and significant underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results. The impairment review of the Company’s goodwill is performed by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value to determine if the goodwill is impaired. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, then goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit were to exceed its fair value, then a goodwill impairment loss is recorded for the amount the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value. The Company conducted its annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of 2022. The impairment analysis did no t result in an impairment charge for the fiscal year ended 2022. There were no impairment charges in 2021 or 2020. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The Company based its fair value estimates on assumptions that it believes are reasonable but are uncertain and subject to changes in market conditions. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed as net income divided by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is computed assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive securities including the dilutive effects of stock options, unvested restricted stock awards and other potentially dilutive securities. The table below presents the weighted-average common stock used to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share: (in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Weighted-average common stock for calculating basic earnings per share 24,353 24,220 24,157 Effect of potentially dilutive securities from equity-based compensation 166 295 374 Weighted-average common stock for calculating diluted earnings per share 24,519 24,515 24,531 In 2022, 2021 and 2020, there were no shares having an anti-dilutive effect requiring exclusion from the computation of diluted earnings per share. The Company has made purchases of shares of its common stock from time to time in over-the-counter market (NASDAQ) transactions, through privately negotiated, large block transactions and through a share repurchase plan, in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In August 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to 2,000,000 shares of the Company's outstanding common stock (the “Repurchase Plan”). The amount and time of the specific repurchases are subject to prevailing market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors, including management’s discretion. All shares repurchased by the Company are canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares of common stock. There can be no assurance that any authorized shares will be repurchased and the Repurchase Plan may be modified, extended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no shares of common stock repurchased. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company repurchased 282,221 shares of its common stock for an average purchase price of $ 48.25 per share or an aggregate price of $ 13.6 million. As of December 31, 2022, 1,309,805 shares remain authorized for repurchase. Accounts Receivable and Concentration of Credit Risk The Company’s accounts receivable consist of amounts due from customers for rentals, sales, financed sales and unbilled amounts for the portion of modular building end-of-lease services earned, which were negotiated as part of the lease agreement. Unbilled receivables related to end-of-lease services, which consists of dismantle and return delivery of buildings, were $ 52.6 million at December 31, 2022 and $ 46.2 million at December 31, 2021. The Company sells primarily on 30 -day terms, individually performs credit evaluation procedures on its customers on each transaction and will require security deposits from its customers when a significant credit risk is identified. The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts in amounts equal to the estimated losses expected to be incurred in the collection of the accounts receivable. The estimated losses are based on historical collection experience in conjunction with an - 66 - evaluation of the current status of the existing accounts. Customer accounts are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when an account is determined to be uncollectable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the Company’s assessment of the collectability of customer accounts receivable from operating lease and non-lease revenues. The Company regularly reviews the allowance by considering factors such as historical payment experience and trends, the age of the accounts receivable balances, the Company’s operating segment, customer industry, credit quality and current economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay. The Company recognized bad debt expense of $ 0.8 million, $ 0.5 million and $ 1.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $ 2.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 and $ 2.1 million for the years ended 2021 and 2020. The allowance for doubtful accounts activity was as follows: (in thousands) 2022 2021 Beginning balance, January 1 $ 2,125 $ 2,100 Provision for doubtful accounts 837 451 Acquired Design Space Reserve (see Note 14) — 125 Write-offs, net of recoveries ( 662 ) ( 551 ) Ending balance, December 31 $ 2,300 $ 2,125 Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts receivable. From time to time, the Company maintains cash balances in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits. Net Investment in Sales-Type Leases The Company enters into sales-type leases with certain qualified customers to purchase its rental equipment, primarily at its TRS-RenTelco operating segment. Sales-type leases have terms that generally range from 12 to 36 months and are collateralized by a security interest in the underlying rental asset. The net investment in sales-type leases was $ 4.5 million at December 31, 2022 and $ 2.2 million at December 31, 2021. The Company’s assessment of current expected losses on these receivables was not material and no credit loss expense was provided as of December 31, 2022. The Company regularly reviews the allowance by considering factors such as historical payment experience, the age of the lease receivable balances, credit quality and current economic conditions that may affect a customer's ability to pay. Lease receivables are considered past due 90 days after invoice. The Company manages the credit risk in net investment in sales-type leases, on an ongoing basis, using a number of factors, including, but not limited to the following: historical payment history, credit score, size of operations, length of time in business, industry, historical profitability, historical cash flows, liquidity and past due amounts. The Company uses credit scores obtained from external credit bureaus as a key indicator for the purposes of determining credit quality of its new customers. The Company does not own available for sale debt securities or other financial assets at December 31, 2022. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company believes that the carrying amounts for cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and notes payable approximate their fair values except for fixed rate debt included in notes payable which has an estimated fair value of $ 89.3 million and $ 158.5 million compared to the recorded value of $ 100.0 million and $ 160.0 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The estimates of fair value of the Company’s fixed rate debt are based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for bank loans with similar terms and average maturities. Foreign Currency Transactions and Translation The Company's Canadian subsidiary, TRS-RenTelco Inc., a British Columbia corporation (“TRS-Canada”), functions as a branch sales office for TRS-RenTelco in Canada. The functional currency for TRS-Canada is the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses of TRS-Canada are reported in the results of operations in the period in which they occur. The Company’s Indian subsidiary, TRS-RenTelco India Private Limited (“TRS-India”), functioned as a rental and sales office for TRS-RenTelco in India, which commenced its closure during 2017. The functional currency for TRS-India is the Indian Rupee. All assets and liabilities of TRS-India are translated into U.S. dollars at period-end exchange rates and all income statement amounts are translated at the average exchange rate for each month within the year. Currently, the Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge its economic exposure with respect to assets, liabilities and firm commitments as the foreign currency transactions and risks to date have not been significant. - 67 - Share-Based Compensation The Company measures and recognizes the compensation expense for all share-based awards made to employees and directors, including stock options, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) and restricted stock units (“RSUs”), based upon estimated fair values. The fair value of stock options and SARs is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and for RSUs based upon the fair market value of the underlying shares of common stock as of the date of grant. The Company recognizes share-based compensation cost ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which generally equals the vesting period. For performance-based RSUs, compensation costs are recognized when it is probable that vesting conditions will be met. In addition, the Company estimates the probable number of shares of common stock that will be earned and the corresponding compensation cost until the achievement of the performance goal is known. The Company recognizes forfeitures based on actual forfeitures when they occur. The Company records share-based compensation costs in “Selling and administrative expenses” in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company recognizes a benefit from share-based compensation in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity if an incremental tax benefit is realized. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in “ Note 8 – Benefit Plans”. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions in determining reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each period presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The most significant estimates included in the financial statements are the future cash flows and fair values used to determine the recoverability of the rental equipment and identifiable definite and indefinite lived intangible assets carrying value, the various assets’ useful lives and residual values, and the allowance for doubtful accounts. NOTE 2. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In March 2022, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2022-02, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Troubled Debt Restructurings and Vintage Disclosures, which eliminates the separate recognition and measurement guidance for troubled debt restructurings by creditors. In addition, the ASU requires disclosure of current-period gross write-offs by year of origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases within the scope of FASB ASC 326-20, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses—Measured at Amortized Cost. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. NOTE 3. IMPLEMENTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Effective January 1, 2021, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, expected to reduce cost and complexity related to the accounting for income taxes. The ASU removed specific exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 (GAAP). It eliminated the need for an organization to analyze whether the following apply in a given period: exception to the incremental approach for intra-period tax allocation; exceptions to accounting for basis differences when there are ownership changes in foreign investments; and exception in interim period income tax accounting for year-to-date losses that exceed anticipated losses. The ASU also improved financial statement preparers’ application of income tax-related guidance and simplifies GAAP for: franchise taxes that are partially based on income; transactions with a government that result in a step up in the tax basis of goodwill; separate financial statements of legal entities that are not subject to tax; and enacted changes in tax laws in interim periods. The adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. NOTE 4. LEASES Lessee The Company leases real estate for certain of its branch offices and rental equipment storage yards, vehicles and equipment used in its rental operations. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. The Company has leases with lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for separately. Right-Of-Use (“ROU”) assets and liabilities are recognized on the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Variable lease payments are excluded from the ROU assets and lease liabilities and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred, which are not material. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. The Company uses the interest rate stated in the lease as the discount rate. If the interest rate is not stated, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on information available on lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Many of the Company’s real estate lease agreements include options to extend the lease, which are not included in the minimum lease terms - 68 - unless they are reasonably certain to be exercised. These leases include one or more options to renew , with renewal terms that may extend the lease term from one to three years . The amount of payments associated with such options is not material. Short-term leases are leases having a term of twelve months or less and exclude leases with a lease term of one month or less. The Company recognizes short-term leases on a straight-line basis and does not record a related ROU asset or liability for such leases. At December 31, 2022 and 2021 the Company’s ROU assets and operating lease liabilities was $ 11.6 m illi on and $ 11.0 million, respectively, which are recorded in Prepaid expenses and other assets and Accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the year ended December 31, 2022, operating lease expense was $ 5.9 million, wh ich includes short term lease expense of $ 0.1 million. At December 31, 2022, the weighted-average remaining lease term for operating leases was 2.8 years and the weighted average discount rate was 3.88 %. The Company had no sub-lease income during the year ended December 31, 2022, and did no t have any finance leases as of December 31, 2022. Supplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows: (in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities: Operating cash flows from operating leases $ 5,863 $ 5,171 Right of use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations: Operating leases $ 3,284 $ 8,116 As of December 31, 2022, maturities of operating lease liabilities were as follows: (in thousands) Year ended December 31, 2023 $ 5,003 2024 3,614 2025 2,340 2026 1,139 2027 56 Total lease payments 12,152 Less: imputed interest ( 559 ) $ 11,593 Lessor The Company’s equipment rentals for each of its operating segments are governed by agreements that detail the lease terms and conditions. The determination of whether these contracts with customers contain a lease generally does not require significant judgement. The Company accounts for these rentals as operating leases. These leases do not include material amounts of variable payments and the Company has made the accounting policy election to exclude all taxes assessed by a governmental authority. The Company generally does not provide an option for the lessee to purchase the rented equipment at the end of the lease term, thus, does not generate material revenue from sales of equipment under such options. Initial lease terms vary in length based upon customer needs and generally range from one to sixty months . Customers have the option to keep equipment on rent beyond the initial lease term on a month-to month basis based upon their needs. All of the Company’s rental products have long useful lives relative to the typical rental term with the original investment typically recovered in approximately three to five years . The rental products are typically rented for a majority of the time owned and a significant portion of the original investment is recovered when sold from inventory. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants. - 69 - As of December 31, 2022, maturities of operating lease payments to be received in 2023 and thereafter were as follows: (in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2023 $ 123,142 2024 38,784 2025 13,135 2026 4,301 2027 1,284 Thereafter 63 $ 180,709 In the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company’s lease revenues were $ 524.5 million, consisting of $ 520.8 million of operating lease revenues and $ 3.7 million of finance lease revenues. The Company has entered into finance leases to finance certain equipment sales to customers. The lease agreements have a bargain purchase option at the end of the lease term. For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company’s finance lease revenues included $ 3.3 million of sales revenues and $ 0.4 million of interest income. The minimum lease payments receivable and the net investment are included in Accounts receivable on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet for such leases, which were as follows: (in thousands) December 31, 2022 Gross minimum lease payments receivable $ 5,048 Less – unearned interest ( 594 ) Net investment in finance lease receivables $ 4,454 As of December 31, 2022, the future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable finance leases to be received in 2023 and thereafter were as follows: (in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2023 $ 2,155 2024 1,154 2025 557 2026 456 2027 132 Total minimum future lease payments to be received $ 4,454 NOTE 5. REVENUE RECOGNITION The Company’s accounting for revenues is governed by two accounting standards. The majority of the Company’s revenues are considered lease or lease related and are accounted for in accordance with Topic 842, Leases. Revenues determined to be non-lease related are accounted for in accordance with ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The Company accounts for revenues when approval and commitment from both parties have been obtained, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. The Company typically recognizes non-lease related revenues at a point in time because the customer does not simultaneously consume the benefits of the Company’s promised goods and services, or performance obligations, and obtain control when delivery and installation are complete. For contracts that have multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in the contract based on the Company’s best estimate of the standalone selling prices of each distinct performance obligation in the contract. The standalone selling price is typically determined based upon the expected cost plus an estimated margin of each performance obligation. The Company generally rents and sells to customers on 30 day payment terms. The Company does not typically offer variable payment terms, or accept non-monetary consideration. Amounts billed and due from the Company’s customers are classified as Accounts receivable on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. For certain sales of modular buildings, progress payments from the customer are received during the manufacturing of new equipment, or the preparation of used equipment. The advance payments are not considered a significant financing component because the payments are used to meet working capital needs during the contract and - 70 - to protect the Company from the customer failing to adequately complete their obligations under the contract. These contract liabilities are included in Deferred income on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and totaled $ 27.4 million and $ 16.8 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Sales revenues totaling $ 11.5 million were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2022, which were included in the contract liability balance at December 31, 2021. For certain modular building sales, the customer retains a small portion of the contract price until full completion of the contract, which results in revenue earned in excess of billings. These unbilled contract assets are included in Accounts receivable on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and totaled $ 0.6 million and $ 1.3 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Lease Revenues Rental revenues from operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease for all operating segments. Rental billings for periods extending beyond period end are recorded as deferred income and are recognized in the period earned. Rental related services revenues are primarily associated with relocatable modular building and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes leases. For modular building leases, rental related services revenues for modifications, delivery, installation, dismantle and return delivery are lease related because the payments are considered minimum lease payments that are an integral part of the negotiated lease agreement with the customer. These revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain leases are accounted for as sales-type leases. For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment. Other revenues include interest income on sales-type leases and rental income on facility leases. Non-Lease Revenues Non-lease revenues are recognized in the period when control of the performance obligation is transferred, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services. For liquid and solid containment solutions, portable storage containers and electronic test equipment, rental related services revenues for delivery and return delivery are considered non-lease revenues. Sales revenues are typically recognized at a point in time, which occurs upon the completion of delivery, installation and acceptance of the equipment by the customer. Accounting for non-lease revenues requires judgment in determining the point in time the customer gains control of the equipment and the appropriate accounting period to recognize revenue. Sales taxes charged to customers are reported on a net basis and are excluded from revenues and expenses. - 71 - The following table disaggregates the Company’s revenues by lease (within the scope of Topic 842) and non-lease revenues (within the scope of Topic 606) and the underlying service provided for the three years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020: (in thousands) Mobile Modular TRS- RenTelco Adler Tanks Enviroplex Consolidated Year Ended December 31, 2022 Leasing $ 331,201 $ 125,695 $ 67,603 $ — $ 524,499 Non-lease: Rental related services 30,430 2,579 27,165 — 60,174 Sales 99,978 21,267 2,933 23,170 147,348 Other 108 1,237 457 — 1,802 Total non-lease 130,516 25,083 30,555 23,170 209,324 Total revenues $ 461,717 $ 150,778 $ 98,158 $ 23,170 $ 733,823 2021 Leasing $ 269,175 $ 116,769 $ 56,654 $ — $ 442,598 Non-lease: Rental related services 25,034 2,469 22,487 — 49,990 Sales 68,982 19,788 2,930 31,081 122,781 Other 125 1,168 171 — 1,464 Total non-lease 94,141 23,425 25,588 31,081 174,235 Total revenues $ 363,316 $ 140,194 $ 82,242 $ 31,081 $ 616,833 2020 Leasing $ 235,003 $ 112,210 $ 54,710 $ — $ 401,923 Non-lease: Rental related services 22,576 2,618 21,320 — 46,514 Sales 63,863 24,461 1,386 32,737 122,447 Other 82 1,522 66 — 1,670 Total non-lease 86,521 28,601 22,772 32,737 170,631 Total revenues $ 321,524 $ 140,811 $ 77,482 $ 32,737 $ 572,554 Customer returns of rental equipment prior to the end of the rental contract term are typically billed a cancellation fee, which is recorded as rental revenue in the period billed. Sales of new relocatable modular buildings, portable storage containers, electronic test equipment and related accessories and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes not manufactured by the Company are typically covered by warranties provided by the manufacturer of the products sold. The Company typically provides limited 90 -day warranties for certain sales of used rental equipment and one-year warranties on equipment manufactured by Enviroplex. Although the Company’s policy is to provide reserves for warranties when required for specific circumstances, the Company has not found it necessary to establish such reserves to date as warranty costs have not been significant. The Company’s incremental cost of obtaining lease contracts, which consists of salesperson commissions, are deferred and amortized over the initial lease term for modular building leases. Incremental costs for obtaining a contract for all other operating segments are expensed in the period incurred because the lease term is typically less than 12 months. NOTE 6.

The Credit Facility provides for a $ 650.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (which may be further increased to $ 950.0 million by adding one or more tranches of term loans and/or increasing the aggregate revolving commitments), which includes a $ 40.0 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a $ 20.0 million sublimit for swingline loans. The proceeds of the Credit Facility are available to be used for general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions. The Credit Facility permits the Company’s existing indebtedness to remain, which includes the Company’s $ 20.0 million Treasury Sweep Note due July 15, 2027 , the Company’s existing senior notes issued pursuant to the Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement with Prudential Investment Management, Inc., dated as of April 21, 2011 (as amended): (i) the $ 60.0 million aggregate outstanding principal of notes issued November 5, 2015, which were repaid on November 5, 2022 , (ii) the $ 40.0 million aggregate outstanding principal of notes issued March 17, 2021 and due March 17, 2028 , and (iii) the $ 60.0 million aggregate outstanding principal of notes issued June 16, 2021 and due June 16, 2026 . In addition, the Company may incur additional senior note indebtedness in an aggregate amount not to exceed $ 250.0 million. The Credit Facility matures on July 15, 2027 and replaced the Company’s prior $ 420.0 million credit facility dated March 31, 2020 with Bank of America, N.A., as agent, as amended. All obligations outstanding under the prior credit facility as of the date of the Credit Facility were refinanced by the Credit Facility on July 15, 2022. On August 19, 2022, the Company entered into an amended and restated Credit Facility Letter Agreement and a Credit Line Note in favor of MUFG Union Bank, N.A., which provides for a $ 20.0 million line of credit facility related to its cash management services (“Sweep Service Facility”). The Sweep Service Facility matures on the earlier of July 15, 2027 , or the date the Company ceases to utilize MUFG Union Bank, N.A. for its cash management services. The Sweep Service Facility replaced the Company’s prior $12.0 million sweep service facility, dated as of March 30, 2020. At December 31, 2022, under the Credit Facility and Sweep Service Facility, the Company had unsecured lines of credit that permit it to borrow up to $ 650.0 million of which $ 313.8 million was outstanding. The Credit Facility contains financial covenants requiring the Company to not (all defined terms used below not otherwise defined herein have the meaning assigned to such terms in the Amended Credit Facility): Amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility bear interest at the Company’s option at either: (i) SOFR plus a defined margin, or (ii) the Agent bank’s prime rate (“base rate”) plus a margin. The applicable margin for each type of loan is measured based upon the Consolidated Leverage Ratio at the end of the prior fiscal quarter and ranges from 1.00 % to 1.75 % for SOFR loans and 0 % to 0.75 % for base rate loans. In addition, the Company pays an unused commitment fee for the portion of the $ 650.0 million credit facility that is not used. These fees are based upon the Consolidated Leverage Ratio and range from 0.15 % to 0.30 %. As o f December 31, 2022 and 2021, the applicable margins were 1.25 % for SOFR based loans, 0.25 % for base rate loans and 0.20 % for unused fees. Amounts borrowed under the Sweep Service Facility are based upon the MUFG Union Bank, N.A. base rate plus an applicable margin and an unused commitment fee for the portion of the $ 20.0 million facility not used. The applicable base rate - 73 - margin and unused commitment fee rates for the Sweep Service Facility are the same as for the Amended Credit Facility. The following information relates to the lines of credit for each of the following periods: (dollar amounts in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Maximum amount outstanding $ 328,752 $ 389,740 Average amount outstanding $ 276,399 $ 239,134 Weighted average interest rate, during the period 3.29 % 2.07 % Prime interest rate, end of period 7.50 % 3.25 % Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement On March 31, 2020, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement (the “Note Purchase Agreement”) with PGIM, Inc. (“PGIM”) and the holders of Series B and Series C Notes previously issued pursuant to the Prior NPA, among the Company and the other parties to the Note Purchase Agreement. The Note Purchase Agreement amended and restated, and superseded in its entirety, the Prior NPA. Pursuant to the Prior NPA, the Company issued (i) $ 40.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.68 % Series B Senior Notes, which were repaid on March 17, 2021 , and (ii) $ 60.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.84 % Series C Senior Notes, which were repaid on November 5, 2022 , to which the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement shall apply. In addition, pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, the Company may authorize the issuance and sale of additional senior notes (the “Shelf Notes”) in the aggregate principal amount of (x) $ 250 million minus (y) the amount of other notes (such as the Series B Senior Notes and Series C Senior Notes, each defined below) then outstanding, to be dated the date of issuance thereof, to mature, in case of each Shelf Note so issued, no more than 15 years after the date of original issuance thereof, to have an average life, in the case of each Shelf Note so issued, of no more than 15 years after the date of original issuance thereof, to bear interest on the unpaid balance thereof from the date thereof at the rate per annum, and to have such other particular terms, as shall be set forth, in the case of each Shelf Note so issued, in accordance with the Note Purchase Agreement. Shelf Notes may be issued and sold from time to time at the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors and in such amounts as the Board of Directors may determine, subject to prospective purchasers’ agreement to purchase the Shelf Notes. The Company will sell the Shelf Notes directly to such purchasers. The full net proceeds of each Shelf Note will be used in the manner described in the applicable Request for Purchase with respect to such Shelf Note. 2.57% Senior Notes Due in 2028 On March 17, 2021, the Company issued and sold to the purchasers $ 40 million aggregate principal amount of 2.57 % Series D Notes (the “Series D Senior Notes”) pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement, dated March 31, 2020 (the “Note Purchase Agreement”), among the Company, PGIM, Inc. and the noteholders party thereto. The Series D Senior Notes are an unsecured obligation of the Company and bear interest at a rate of 2.57 % per annum and mature on March 17, 2028 . Interest on the Series D Senior Notes is payable semi-annually beginning on September 17, 2021 and continuing thereafter on March 17 and September 17 of each year until maturity. The principal balance is due when the notes mature on March 17, 2028. The full net proceeds from the Series D Senior Notes were used to pay off the Company’s $ 40 million Series B Senior Notes. At December 31, 2022, the principal balance outstanding under the Series D Senior Notes was $ 40.0 million. 2.35% Senior Notes Due in 2026 On June 16, 2021, the Company issued and sold to the purchasers $ 60 million aggregate principal amount of 2.35 % Series E Notes (the ""Series E Notes"") pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement, dated March 31, 2020 (the “Note Purchase Agreement”), among the Company, PGIM, Inc. and the noteholders party thereto.

At December 31, 2022, the principal balance outstanding under the Series E Senior Notes was $ 60.0 million. Among other restrictions, the Note Purchase Agreement, which has superseded in its entirety the Prior NPA, under which the Series D Senior Notes and Series E Senior Notes were sold, contains financial covenants requiring the Company to not (all defined terms used below not otherwise defined herein have the meaning assigned to such terms in the Note Purchase Agreement): - 74 - At December 31, 2022, the Company was in compliance with each of the aforementioned covenants. There are no anticipated trends that the Company is aware of that would indicate non-compliance with these covenants, though, significant deterioration in the Company’s financial performance could impact its ability to comply with these covenants.

The wind down of operations in India began in 2017. As a result, a valuation allowance was recorded against the deferred tax assets that resulted primarily from accumulated net operating loss carry forwards in India that management estimated the benefit of which will not be realized. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s foreign net operating losses for tax purposes were $ 0.6 million. If not realized, these carry forwards will begin to expire in 2023 . For income tax purposes, deductible compensation related to share-based awards is based on the value of the award when realized, which may be different than the compensation expense recognized by the company for financial statement purposes which is based on the award value on the date of grant. The difference between the value of the award upon grant, and the value of the award when ultimately realized, creates either additional tax expense or benefit. In 2022, 2021 and 2020 exercise of share-based awards by employees resulted in an excess tax benefit of $ 2.6 million, $ 2.5 million and $ 1.9 million, respectively. The Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. The Company evaluated all of its tax positions for which the statute of limitations remained open and determined there were no material unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. In addition, there have been no material changes in unrecognized benefits during 2022, 2021 and 2020. The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various states and foreign jurisdictions. Tax regulations within each jurisdiction are subject to interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and require the application of significant judgment. Our income tax returns are subject to examination by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. There may be differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations, and as a result, disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of income. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for the years before 2018. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision (benefit) for income taxes in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income for all periods presented. Such interest and penalties were not significant for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. NOTE 8. BENEFIT PLANS Stock Plans The Company adopted the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2016 Plan”), effective June 8, 2016, under which 2,000,000 shares of the common stock of the Company, plus the number of shares that remain available for grants of awards under the Company's 2007 Stock Option Plan (the “2007 Plan”) become available as a result of forfeiture, termination, or expiration of awards previously granted under the 2007 Plan, were reserved for the grant of equity awards to its employees, directors and consultants. The equity awards have - 76 - a maximum term of 7 years at an exercise price of not less than 100 % of the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date the equity award is granted. The 2016 Plan replaced the 2007 Plan. The 2016 Plan provides for the grant of awards in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), the vesting of which may be performance-based or service-based, and other rights and benefits. Each RSU issued reduces the number of shares of the Company’s common stock available for grant under the 2016 Plan by two shares. There were no significant modifications to the 2016 Plan or awards classified as liabilities in the year ended December 31, 2022. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, the share-based compensation expense was $ 8.0 million, $ 7.7 million and $ 5.5 million, respectively, before provision for income taxes. The Company recorded a tax benefit of approximately $ 2.2 million, $ 2.1 million and $ 1.5 million, respectively, related to the aforementioned share-based compensation expenses. There was no capitalized share-based compensation expense in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Stock Options As of December 31, 2022, a cumulative total of 8,458,600 shares subject to options have been granted with exercise prices ranging from $ 3.47 to $ 40.37 . Of these, options have been exercised for the purchase of 6,767,253 shares, while options for 1,672,732 shares have been terminated, and options for 139,350 shares with exercise prices ranging from $ 24.60 to $ 40.37 remained outstanding under the stock plans. These options vest over five years and expire seven years after grant. To date, no options have been issued to any of the Company’s non-employee advisors. As of December 31, 2022, 1,263,760 shares remained available for issuance of awards under the stock plans. A summary of the Company’s option activity and related information for the three years ended December 31, 2022 is as follows: Number of options Weighted- average price Weighted- average remaining contractual term (in years) Aggregate intrinsic value (in millions) Balance at December 31, 2019 580,140 $ 29.57 Options granted — — Options exercised ( 163,670 ) 30.22 Options cancelled/forfeited/expired ( 7,060 ) 28.95 Balance at December 31, 2020 409,410 29.33 Options granted — — Options exercised ( 133,020 ) 28.57 Options cancelled/forfeited/expired ( 1,760 ) 34.57 Balance at December 31, 2021 274,630 29.66 Options granted — — Options exercised ( 135,280 ) 25.61 Options cancelled/forfeited/expired — — Balance at December 31, 2022 139,350 $ 33.59 1.04 $ 9.1 Exercisable at December 31, 2022 139,350 $ 33.59 1.04 $ 9.1 Expected to vest after December 31, 2022 139,350 $ 33.59 1.04 $ 9.1 The intrinsic value of stock options at any point in time is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying awards and the quoted price of the Company’s common stock. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised and sold under the Company’s stock option plans was $ 7.9 million, $ 7.0 million and $ 5.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, determined as of the date of option exercise. As of December 31, 2022, there was no unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation option arrangements granted under the Company’s stock plans. - 77 - The following table indicates the options outstanding and options exercisable by exercise price with the weighted-average remaining contractual life for the options outstanding and the weighted-average exercise price at December 31, 2022: Options Outstanding Options Exercisable Exercise price Number outstanding at December 31, 2022 Weighted-average remaining contractual life (Years) Weighted-average grant date value Number exercisable at December 31, 2022 Weighted-average grant date value $ 20 – 25 16,850 0.17 $ 24.60 16,850 $ 24.60 $ 25 – 30 — — $ — — $ — $ 30 – 35 115,020 1.16 $ 34.54 115,020 $ 34.54 $ 35 – 40 6,800 1.00 $ 39.19 6,800 $ 39.19 $ 40 – 45 680 1.67 $ 40.37 680 $ 40.37 $ 20 – 45 139,350 1.04 $ 33.59 139,350 $ 33.59 The Company utilizes the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of share-based compensation at the date of grant, which requires the use of accounting judgment and financial estimates, including estimates of the expected term option holders will retain their vested stock options before exercising them, the estimated volatility of the Company’s stock price over the expected term and the expected number of options that will be forfeited prior to the completion of their vesting requirements. Application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different estimates of the fair value of share-based compensation amounts recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. No options were granted in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. Restricted Stock Units The following table summarizes the activity of the Company’s RSUs, which includes service-based and performance-based awards, for the three years ended December 31, 2022: Weighted- Aggregate average intrinsic Number grant date value of shares fair value (in millions) Balance at December 31, 2019 196,248 $ 50.68 RSUs granted 126,540 50.99 RSUs vested ( 89,225 ) 43.42 RSUs cancelled/forfeited/expired ( 7,593 ) 57.93 Balance at December 31, 2020 225,970 57.06 RSUs granted 116,326 72.75 RSUs vested ( 116,242 ) 53.32 RSUs cancelled/forfeited/expired ( 8,646 ) 52.78 Balance at December 31, 2021 217,408 67.63 RSUs granted 95,028 77.79 RSUs vested ( 114,274 ) 58.30 RSUs cancelled/forfeited/expired ( 10,754 ) 70.10 Balance at December 31, 2022 187,408 $ 76.74 $ 18.4 Performance-based RSUs issued prior to 2018 vest over five years , with 60 % of the shares immediately vesting after three years when the performance criteria has been determined to have been met and 20 % of the remaining shares vesting annually at the anniversary of the performance determination date, subject to continuous employment of the participant. The performance-based RSU grants issued in 2018 and thereafter vest after three years with 100 % of the shares vesting immediately when performance criteria has been determined to have been met. There were 92,310 performance-based RSUs expected to vest as of December 31, 2022. Service based RSUs issued to the Company’s directors generally vest over twelve to fourteen months . Service based RSUs issued to the Company’s management vest over three years. There were 95,098 service-based RSUs expected to vest as of December 31, 2022. No forfeitures are currently expected. The total fair value of RSUs that vested during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 based on the weighted average grant date values was $ 9.3 million, $ 9.2 million and $ 6.0 million, respectively. Share-based compensation expense for RSUs for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 7.9 million, $ 7.3 million and $ 4.6 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, the total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSUs was $ 8.5 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.2 years. - 78 - Employee Stock Ownership and 401(k) Plans The McGrath RentCorp Employee Stock Ownership and 401(k) Plan (the “KSOP”) provides that each participant may annually contribute an elected percentage of his or her salary, not to exceed the statutory limit. Each employee who has at least two months of service with the Company and is 21 years or older, is eligible to participate in the KSOP. The Company, at its discretion, may make matching contributions. Contributions are expensed in the year approved by the Board of Directors. Dividends on the Company’s stock held by the KSOP are treated as ordinary dividends and, in accordance with existing tax laws, are deducted by the Company in the year paid. For the year ended December 31, 2022 dividends deducted by the Company were $ 0.5 million, which resulted in a tax benefit of approximately $ 0.1 million in 2022. At December 31, 2022, the KSOP held 258,758 shares, or 1 % of the Company’s total common shares outstanding. These shares are included in basic and diluted earnings per share calculations. NOTE 9. SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY The Company has in the past made purchases of shares of its common stock from time to time in over-the-counter market (NASDAQ) transactions, through privately negotiated, large block transactions and through a share repurchase plan, in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In August 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase 2,000,000 shares of the Company's outstanding common stock (the “Repurchase Plan”). The amount and time of the specific repurchases are subject to prevailing market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors, including management’s discretion. All shares repurchased by the Company are canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares of common stock. There can be no assurance that any authorized shares will be repurchased and the repurchase program may be modified, extended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. There were no shares of common stock repurchased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. As of December 31, 2022, 1,309,805 shares remain authorized for repurchase under the Repurchase Plan. NOTE 10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company leases certain facilities under various operating leases. Most of the lease agreements provide the Company with the option of renewing its lease at the end of the lease term, at the fair rental value. In most cases, management expects that in the normal course of business, facility leases will be renewed or replaced by other leases. Minimum payments under these leases, exclusive of property taxes and insurance, are as follows: (in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2023 $ 4,417 2024 3,375 2025 2,183 2026 1,080 2027 56 $ 11,111 Facility rent expense was $ 7.0 million in 2022, $ 5.6 million in 2021 and $ 3.7 million in 2020. The Company is involved in various lawsuits and routine claims arising out of the normal course of its business. The Company maintains insurance coverage for its operations and employees with appropriate aggregate, per occurrence and deductible limits as the Company reasonably determines necessary or prudent with current operations and historical experience. The major policies include coverage for property, general liability, auto, directors and officers, health, and workers’ compensation insurances. The Company records a provision for a liability when it believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. The Company reviews these provisions at least quarterly and adjusts these provisions to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Litigation is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Company’s control. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility that the ultimate amount of liability not covered by insurance, if any, under any pending litigation and claims, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the financial position or operating results of the Company. The Company’s health plans are self-funded high deductible plans with annual stop-loss insurance of $ 200,000 per claim. Beginning in 2019, the Company’s workers compensation insurance is underwritten by an insurance company with no stop-loss value and $ 350,000 for prior claim years. Insurance providers are responsible for making claim payments that exceed these amounts on an individual claim basis. In addition, the Company has stop loss insurance that pays for claim payments made during a twelve month - 79 - coverage period that exceeds certain specified thresholds in the aggregate. The Company records an expense when health and workers compensation claim payments are made and accrues for the portion of claims incurred, but not yet paid at period end. The Company makes these accruals based upon a combination of historical claim payments, loss development experience and actuarial estimates. A high degree of judgment is required in developing the underlying assumptions and the resulting amounts to be accrued. In addition, our assumptions will change as the Company’s loss experience develops. All of these factors have the potential for impacting the amounts previously accrued and the Company may be required to increase or decrease the amounts previously accrued. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, accruals for the Company’s health and workers’ compensation high deductible plans were $ 2.0 million and $ 2.5 million, respectively. NOTE 11.

RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS There were no significant related party transactions in the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, or amounts owed to related parties at such dates. - 80 - NOTE 13. SEGMENT REPORTING FASB guidelines establish annual and interim reporting standards for an enterprise’s operating segments and related disclosures about its products, services, geographic areas and major customers. In accordance with these guidelines the Company’s four reportable segments are Mobile Modular, TRS-RenTelco, Adler Tanks and Enviroplex. Management focuses on several key measures to evaluate and assess each segment’s performance including rental revenue growth, gross margin, Adjusted EBITDA and income before provision for income taxes. Excluding interest expense, allocations of revenue and expense not directly associated with one of these segments are generally allocated to Mobile Modular, TRS-RenTelco and Adler Tanks, based on their pro-rata share of direct revenues. Interest expense is allocated amongst Mobile Modular, TRS-RenTelco and Adler Tanks based on their pro-rata share of average rental equipment at cost, goodwill, intangible assets, accounts receivable, deferred income and customer security deposits. The Company does not report total assets by business segment. Summarized financial information for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, for the Company’s reportable segments is shown in the following tables: (dollar amounts in thousands) Mobile Modular TRS- RenTelco Adler Tanks Enviroplex 1 Consolidated Year Ended December 31, 2022 Rental revenues $ 268,288 $ 121,375 $ 66,366 $ — $ 456,029 Rental related services revenues 91,851 3,112 27,654 — 122,617 Sales and other revenues 101,578 26,291 4,138 23,170 155,177 Total revenues 461,717 150,778 98,158 23,170 733,823 Depreciation of rental equipment 31,172 49,253 16,004 — 96,429 Gross profit 217,187 67,899 46,700 5,122 336,908 Selling and administrative expenses 110,234 27,245 28,428 5,435 171,342 Income (loss) from operations 106,953 40,654 18,272 ( 313 ) 165,566 Interest expense (income) allocation 10,175 3,294 2,938 ( 1,239 ) 15,168 Income before provision for income taxes 96,778 36,982 15,334 926 150,020 Adjusted EBITDA 3 159,224 92,007 37,660 ( 25 ) 288,866 Rental equipment acquisitions 121,607 69,928 3,623 — 195,158 Accounts receivable, net (period end) 139,107 26,442 20,172 4,302 190,023 Rental equipment, at cost (period end) 1,123,268 398,267 308,396 — 1,829,931 Rental equipment, net book value (period end) 815,392 174,924 137,738 — 1,128,054 Utilization (period end) 2 80.7 % 59.4 % 57.1 % Average utilization 2 79.1 % 64.2 % 53.1 % - 81 - Segment Data (Continued) (dollar amounts in thousands) Mobile Modular TRS- RenTelco Adler Tanks Enviroplex 1 Consolidated Year Ended December 31, 2021 Rental revenues $ 220,569 $ 113,419 $ 56,025 $ — $ 390,013 Rental related services revenues 72,330 2,880 22,851 — 98,061 Sales and other revenues 70,417 23,895 3,366 31,081 128,759 Total revenues 363,316 140,194 82,242 31,081 616,833 Depreciation of rental equipment 28,071 47,374 16,442 — 91,887 Gross profit 176,040 61,394 33,699 9,888 281,021 Selling and administrative expenses 92,603 25,152 25,542 5,303 148,600 Income from operations 83,436 36,243 8,157 4,585 132,421 Interest expense (income) allocation 6,433 2,270 2,211 ( 459 ) 10,455 Income before provision for income taxes 77,003 33,763 5,946 5,044 121,756 Adjusted EBITDA 3 130,089 85,723 27,961 4,844 248,617 Rental equipment acquisitions 188,392 61,097 191 — 249,680 Accounts receivable, net (period end) 112,295 22,115 16,378 8,711 159,499 Rental equipment, at cost (period end) 1,040,094 361,391 309,908 — 1,711,393 Rental equipment, net book value (period end) 751,537 161,900 151,787 — 1,065,224 Utilization (period end) 2 76.4 % 62.9 % 47.6 % Average utilization 2 76.2 % 67.0 % 45.4 % 2020 Rental revenues $ 188,719 $ 109,083 $ 53,988 $ — $ 351,790 Rental related services revenues 67,527 3,080 21,786 — 92,393 Sales and other revenues 65,278 28,648 1,708 32,737 128,371 Total revenues 321,524 140,811 77,482 32,737 572,554 Depreciation of rental equipment 22,967 46,472 16,427 — 85,866 Gross profit 155,874 60,864 34,079 12,929 263,746 Selling and administrative expenses 68,470 24,306 24,764 5,453 122,993 Income from operations 87,404 36,558 9,315 7,476 140,753 Interest expense (income) allocation 5,104 2,133 2,107 ( 557 ) 8,787 Income before benefit for income taxes 82,300 34,503 7,208 8,033 132,044 Adjusted EBITDA 3 119,202 85,082 29,010 7,729 241,023 Rental equipment acquisitions 39,078 42,588 2,541 — 84,207 Accounts receivable, net (period end) 81,640 22,735 13,655 5,286 123,316 Rental equipment, at cost (period end) 882,115 333,020 315,706 — 1,530,841 Rental equipment, net book value (period end) 611,590 156,536 169,990 — 938,116 Utilization (period end) 2 76.0 % 67.4 % 39.8 % Average utilization 2 77.2 % 66.2 % 44.6 % No single customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues during 2022, 2021 and 2020.

ACQUISITIONS On May 17, 2021, the Company completed the purchase of substantially all of the assets of Design Space Modular Buildings PNW, LP (“Design Space”) for $ 267.3 million in cash consideration on the closing date. Design Space provides modular buildings and portable storage containers rental and sale solutions to customers in the West and Pacific Northwest states in the U.S. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase of a “business” in accordance with criteria in ASC 805, Business Combinations, using the purchase - 82 - method of accounting. Under the purchase method of accounting, the total purchase price is assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values on the closing date. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill. The financial results of Design Space were a part of the Mobile Modular segment since May 17, 2021, including $ 1.7 million of transaction costs. On April 1, 2021 the Company completed the purchase of assets of GRS Holding LLC, DBA Kitchens To Go (“Kitchens To Go”) for $ 18.3 million in cash consideration. Kitchens To Go provides interim and permanent modular kitchen solutions for foodservice providers that require flexible facilities to continue or expand operations. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase of a “business” in accordance with criteria in ASC 805 using the purchase method of accounting. The financial results of Kitchens To Go were a part of the Mobile Modular segment since April 1, 2021, including $ 0.3 million of transaction costs. The following tables summarize the purchase price allocations reflecting estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Design Space and Kitchens To Go acquisitions, with excess amounts allocated to goodwill. The valuation of intangible assets acquired is based on certain valuation assumptions including cash flow projections, discount rates, contributory asset charges and other valuation model inputs. The valuation of tangible long-lived assets acquired is dependent upon various analyses including an analysis of the condition and estimated remaining economic lives of the assets acquired. Design Space: (dollar amounts in thousands) Rental equipment $ 116,272 Intangible assets: Goodwill 101,874 Customer relationships 37,900 Non-compete 2,500 Customer backlog 1,600 Accounts receivable 12,025 Property, plant and equipment 4,139 Prepaid expenses and other assets 5,366 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities ( 11,613 ) Deferred income ( 2,784 ) Total purchase price $ 267,279 Kitchens To Go: (dollar amounts in thousands) Rental equipment $ 12,853 Intangible assets: Goodwill 2,322 Customer relationships 1,700 Trade name 1,200 Non-compete 600 Customer backlog 300 Accounts receivable 212 Property, plant and equipment 365 Prepaid expenses and other assets 1,199 Accounts payable and accrued liabilities ( 1,659 ) Deferred income ( 747 ) Total purchase price $ 18,345 The value assigned to identifiable intangible assets was determined based on discounted estimated future cash flows associated with such assets to their present value. The combined acquired goodwill of $ 104,196 reflects the strategic fit of Design Space and Kitchens to Go with the Company’s modular business operations. The Company amortizes the acquired customer relationships, tradename and non-compete over their expected useful lives of 8 years, 8 years and 5 years, respectively. As of the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the customer backlog has been amortized in full. Goodwill is expected to have an indefinite life and will be subject to future impairment testing. The goodwill is deductible for tax purposes over 15 years. The following unaudited pro forma financial information shows the combined results of operations of the Company, Design Space and Kitchens To Go as if the acquisitions occurred as of the beginning of the periods presented. The pro forma results include - 83 - the effects of the amortization of the purchased intangible assets and depreciation expense of acquired rental equipment valuation step up, interest expense on the debt incurred to finance the acquisitions. A pro forma adjustment has been made to reflect the income taxes that would have been recorded at the combined federal and state statutory rate of 28 % on the acquisitions’ combined net income. The pro forma results for the year ended December 31, 2021 have been adjusted to include transaction related costs. This pro forma data is presented for informational purposes only and does not purport to be indicative of the results of the future operations or the results that would have occurred had the acquisitions taken place in the periods noted below: (Unaudited) Year Ended December 31, (dollar amounts in thousands, except for per share amounts) 2022 2021 Pro-forma total revenues $ 733,823 $ 647,866 Pro-forma net income $ 115,138 $ 93,065 Pro-forma basic earnings per share $ 4.73 $ 3.84 Pro-forma diluted earnings per share $ 4.70 $ 3.80 Design Space and Kitchens To Go Actual total revenues $ 85,095 Actual net income $ 11,100 Actual basic earnings per share $ 0.46 Actual diluted earnings per share $ 0.45 On December 31, 2021 the Company completed the purchase of the assets of Titan Storage Containers, LLC (“Titan”) for $ 6.9 million in cash consideration. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase of “assets” in accordance with criteria in ASC 805 and the assessment of the fair value of the purchased assets was allocated primarily to rental equipment totaling $ 6.2 million and rolling stock assets totaling $ 0.8 million, partially offset by accrued liabilities of $ 0.2 million. The rolling stock assets included delivery trucks, delivery trailers, trucks and forklifts. Supplemental pro forma prior year information has not been provided as the historical financial results of Titan were not significant. Incremental transaction costs associated with the asset purchase were not significant. NOTE 15. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS On February 1, 2022, the Company completed the sale of Adler Tank Rentals, LLC to Ironclad Environmental Solutions, Inc. (""Ironclad""), a portfolio company of Kinderhook Industries, for a sale price of $ 265 million. The divestiture of the Company's Adler Tanks business represents the Company's strategic shift to concentrate its operations on its core modular and storage businesses. The sale price was subject to certain adjustments, including net working capital, certain qualified capital expenditures and certain transaction expenses to be borne by the Company. In connection with the sale, the Company entered into a number of ancillary agreements, including an escrow agreement associated with net working capital adjustments, a restricted covenant agreement, a transition services agreement, and a number of leases whereby Ironclad or one of its affiliates would be a lessee to certain properties owned by the Company that the Adler Tanks business would continue to utilize after the sale. In accordance with ASC 205-20, Presentation of Financial Statements - Discontinued Operations and ASC 360 , Property, Plant and Equipment, the Company determined that the criteria for discontinued operations and held-for-sale, respectively, were not met during the fourth quarter of 2022. On February 1, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of Vesta Housing Solutions Holdings, Inc. (“Vesta Modular”), a portfolio company of Kinderhook Industries, for a purchase price of $ 400 million. The purchase price was subject to certain adjustments, including net working capital, certain qualified capital expenditures and certain transaction expenses to be borne by the seller of Vesta Modular. In connection with the acquisition, the Company purchased a representation and warranty insurance policy to provide certain recourse in the event of breaches of representations and warranties of Vesta Modular and the seller of Vesta Modular under the stock purchase agreement. Vesta Modular is a leading provider of temporary and permanent modular space solutions serving customers between its modular leasing and modular construction divisions. The acquisition is expected to strengthen the Company's core modular portfolio and accelerate growth through increases in geographic coverage and density. The acquisition will be accounted for as a purchase of a “business” in accordance with criteria in ASC 805, Business Combinations , using the purchase method of accounting. - 84 - ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE. None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Company’s management under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in rules promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) for the Company. Based on their evaluation the CEO and CFO have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. During the last quarter of the Company’s fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and the CEO and CFO have concluded that these controls and procedures are effective at the “reasonable assurance” level. Management’s Assessment of Internal Control. Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, is discussed in the Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting included on page 55. The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 has been audited by Grant Thornton LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, and its report is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS. General Overview McGrath RentCorp (the “Company”) is a California corporation organized in 1979 with corporate offices located in Livermore, California. The Company’s common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “MGRC”. References in this report to the “Company”, “we”, “us”, and “ours” refer to McGrath RentCorp and its subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise. The Company is a diversified business-to-business rental company with four rental divisions: relocatable modular buildings, portable storage containers, electronic test equipment, and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes. Although the Company’s primary emphasis is on equipment rentals, sales of equipment occur in the normal course of business. The Company is comprised of four reportable business segments: (1) its modular building and portable storage segment (“Mobile Modular”); (2) its electronic test equipment segment (“TRS-RenTelco”); (3) its containment solutions for the storage of hazardous and non-hazardous liquids and solids segment (“Adler Tanks”); and (4) its classroom manufacturing business selling modular buildings used primarily as classrooms in California (“Enviroplex”). Business Model The Company invests capital in rental products and generally has recovered its original investment through rents less cash operating expenses in a relatively short period of time compared to the product’s rental life. When the Company’s rental products are sold, the proceeds generally have covered a high percentage of the original investment. With these characteristics, a significant base of rental assets on rent generates a considerable amount of operating cash flows to support continued rental asset growth. The Company’s rental products have the following characteristics: • The product required by the customer tends to be expensive compared to the Company’s monthly rental charge, with the interim rental solution typically evaluated as a less costly alternative. • Generally, we believe the Company’s customers have a short-term need for our rental products. The customer’s rental requirement may be driven by a number of factors including time, budget or capital constraints, future uncertainty impacting their ongoing requirements, equipment availability, specific project requirements, peak periods of demand or the customer may want to eliminate the burdens and risks of ownership. -2- • All of the Company’s rental products have long useful lives relative to the typical rental term. Modular buildings (“modulars”) have an estimated life of eighteen years compared to the typical rental term of twelve to twenty-four months, electronic test equipment has an estimated life range of one to eight years (depending on the type of product) compared to a typical rental term of one to six months, and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes have an estimated life of twenty years compared to typical rental terms of one to six months. • We believe short-term rental rates typically recover the Company’s original investment quickly based on the respective product’s annual yield, or annual rental revenues divided by the average cost of rental equipment. For modulars the original investment is recovered in approximately five years, in approximately three years for electronic test equipment and in approximately four years for liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes. • When a product is sold from our rental inventory, a significant portion of the original investment is usually recovered. Effective asset management is a critical element to each of the rental businesses and the residuals realized when product is sold from inventory. Modular asset management requires designing and building the product for a long life, coupled with ongoing repair and maintenance investments, to ensure its long useful rental life and generally higher residuals upon sale. Electronic test equipment asset management requires understanding, selecting and investing in equipment technologies that support market demand and, once invested, proactively managing the equipment at the model level for optimum utilization through its technology life cycle to maximize the rental revenues and residuals realized. Liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes asset management requires selecting and purchasing quality product and making ongoing repair and maintenance investments to ensure its long rental life. The Company believes that rental revenue growth from an increasing base of rental assets and improved gross profits on rents are the best measures of the health of each of our rental businesses. Additionally, we believe our business model and results are enhanced by operational leverage that is created from large regional sales and inventory centers for modulars, a single U.S. based sales, inventory and operations facility for electronic test equipment, as well as shared senior management and back office functions for financing, human resources, insurance, marketing, information technology and operating and accounting systems. Human Capital Management As of December 31, 2021, the Company had 1,184 employees, of whom 118 were primarily administrative and executive personnel, with 685, 167, 132 and 82 in the operations of Mobile Modular, Adler Tanks, TRS-RenTelco and Enviroplex, respectively. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and management believes its relationship with our employees is good. The Company believes its employees are key to its success and it is committed to all of its employees’ engagement, training and career development, and personal and professional growth. The Board of Directors also receives regular updates from senior management on matters relating to the Company’s strategy for the recruitment, retention and development of the Company’s employees. The Company provides training in technical, operational and managerial skills, and places special emphasis on safety, effective communications, customer service, and employee development. Additionally, the Company offers employees a tuition reimbursement program whereby the employee may receive reimbursement for tuition and fees for undergraduate or graduate level academic courses at an accredited two or four year college or university that may help employees improve performance in their current job or prepare them for advancement. Government Regulations We are subject to certain environmental, transportation, anti-corruption, import controls, health and safety and other laws and regulations in locations in which we operate. Our activity in jurisdictions in which we operate is additionally subject to anti-bribery laws and regulations, such as the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, which prevent companies and their officers, employees and agents from making payments to officials and public entities of foreign countries to facilitate obtaining new contracts. We are also subject to laws and regulations that govern and impose liability for activities that may have adverse environmental effects, including discharges into air and water, and handling and disposal of hazardous substances and waste. Our motor vehicles and related units are subject to regulation in certain states under motor vehicle and similar registrations. While we incur costs in our business to comply with these laws and regulations, management does not believe that the costs of compliance with these various governmental regulations is material to our business and financial condition. Available Information We make the Company’s Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filings available at our website www.mgrc.com. These filings include our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Act of 1934, which are available as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company electronically files such material with, or furnishes such material to, the SEC.

Modulars vary from simple single-unit construction site offices to multi-floor modular complexes. The Company’s modular rental fleet includes a full range of styles and sizes. The Company considers its modulars to be among the most attractive and well-designed available. The units are constructed with wood or metal siding, sturdily built and physically capable of a long useful life. Modulars are generally provided with installed heat, air conditioning, lighting, electrical outlets and floor covering, and may have customized interiors including partitioning, cabinetry and plumbing facilities. Mobile Modular purchases new modulars from various manufacturers who build to Mobile Modular’s design specifications. During 2021, Mobile Modular purchased 41% of its modular units from one manufacturer. The Company believes that the loss of any of its primary modular manufacturers could have an adverse effect on its operations since Mobile Modular could experience higher prices and longer lead times for delivery of modular units until other manufacturers were able to increase their production capacity. The Company’s modulars are manufactured to comply with state building codes, have a low risk of obsolescence, and can be modified or reconfigured to accommodate a wide variety of customer needs. Historically, as state building codes have changed over the years, Mobile Modular has been able to continue to use existing modulars, with minimal, if any, required upgrades. The Company has no assurance that it will continue to be able to use existing modular equipment with minimal upgrades as building codes change in the future. Mobile Modular currently operates from regional sales and inventory centers in California, Texas, Florida, Georgia and Virginia, serving large geographic areas in these and surrounding states, and sales offices serving Louisiana, North Carolina and South Carolina. In 2021, the Company purchased substantially all of the assets of Design Space Modular Buildings PNW, LP, which operated from a number of smaller sales and inventory centers across the Western United States. In 2021, the Company completed the purchase of the assets of GRS Holding LLC, DBA Kitchens To Go (“Kitchens To Go”). Kitchens To Go provides interim and permanent modular kitchen solutions serving the United States from its inventory center in Indiana. These sales and inventory centers have in-house infrastructure and operational capabilities to support quick and efficient repair, modification, and refurbishment of equipment for the next rental opportunity. The Company believes operating from large regional sales and inventory centers results in better operating margins as operating costs can be spread over a large installed customer base. Mobile Modular actively maintains and repairs its rental equipment, and management believes this ensures the continued use of the modular product over its long life and, when sold, has resulted in higher sale proceeds relative to its capitalized cost. When rental equipment returns from a customer, the necessary repairs and preventative maintenance are performed prior to its next rental. By making these expenditures for repair and maintenance throughout the equipment’s life we believe that older equipment can generally rent for rates similar to those of newer equipment. Management believes the condition of the equipment is a more significant factor in determining the rental rate and sale price than its age. Over the last three years, used equipment sold each year represented approximately 2% of rental equipment, and has been, on average, 15 years old with sale proceeds above its net book value. Competitive Strengths Market Leadership – Mobile Modular has the leading modular building and container fleet in the United States. Rental units for temporary classroom and other educational space needs are an important market segment and the Company believes Mobile Modular is the leading supplier in California and Florida, and a significant supplier in Texas, of modular educational facilities for rental to both public and private schools. Management is knowledgeable about the needs of its educational customers and the related regulatory requirements in the states where Mobile Modular operates, which enables Mobile Modular to meet its customers’ specific project requirements. Expertise – The Company believes that over the 40 plus years during which Mobile Modular has competed in the modular rental industry, it has developed expertise that differentiates it from its competitors. Mobile Modular has dedicated its attention to continuously developing and improving the quality of its modular units. Mobile Modular has expertise in the licensing and regulatory requirements that govern modulars in the states where it operates, and its management, sales and operational staffs are knowledgeable and committed to providing exemplary customer service. Mobile Modular has expertise in project management and complex applications. -5- Operating Structure – Part of the Company’s strategy for Mobile Modular is to create facilities and infrastructure capabilities that its competitors cannot easily duplicate. Mobile Modular achieves this by building regional sales and inventory centers designed to serve a broad geographic area and a large installed customer base under a single overhead structure, thereby reducing its cost per transaction. The Company’s regional facilities and related infrastructure enable Mobile Modular to maximize its modular inventory utilization through efficient and cost effective in-house repair, maintenance and refurbishment for quick redeployment of equipment to meet its customers’ needs. Asset Management – The Company believes Mobile Modular markets high quality, well-constructed and attractive modulars. Mobile Modular requires manufacturers to build to its specifications, which enables Mobile Modular to maintain a standardized quality fleet. In addition, through its ongoing repair, refurbishment and maintenance programs, the Company believes Mobile Modular’s buildings are the best maintained in the industry. The Company depreciates its modular buildings over an 18 year estimated useful life to a 50% residual value. Older buildings continue to be productive primarily because of Mobile Modular’s focus on ongoing fleet maintenance. Also, as a result of Mobile Modular’s maintenance programs, when a modular unit is sold, a high percentage of the equipment’s capitalized cost is recovered. In addition, the fleet’s utilization is regionally optimized by managing inventory through estimates of market demand, fulfillment of current rental and sale order activity, modular returns and capital purchases. Customer Service - The Company believes the modular rental industry to be service intensive and locally based. The Company strives to provide excellent service by meeting its commitments to its customers, being proactive in resolving project issues and seeking to continuously improve the customers’ experience. Mobile Modular is committed to offering quick response to requests for information, providing experienced assistance, on time delivery and preventative maintenance of its units. Mobile Modular’s goal is to continuously improve its procedures, processes and computer systems to enhance internal operational efficiency. The Company believes this dedication to customer service results in high levels of customer loyalty and repeat business. Market Management estimates relocatable modular building rental is an industry that today has equipment on rent or available for rent in the U.S. with an aggregate original cost of over $5.0 billion. Mobile Modular’s largest market segment is for temporary classroom and other educational space needs of public and private schools, colleges and universities in California and Florida, and to a lesser extent in Texas, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C. Management believes the demand for rental classrooms is caused by shifting and fluctuating school populations, the limited state funds for new construction, the need for temporary classroom space during reconstruction of older schools, class size reduction and the phasing out of portable classrooms compliant with older building codes (see “Classroom Rentals and Sales to Public Schools (K-12)” below). Other customer applications include sales offices, construction field offices, health care facilities, church sanctuaries and child care facilities. Industrial, manufacturing, entertainment and utility companies, as well as governmental agencies commonly use large multi-modular complexes to serve their interim administrative and operational space needs. Modulars offer customers quick, cost-effective space solutions while conserving their capital. The Company’s corporate offices and regional sales and inventory center offices are housed in various sizes of modular units. Since most of Mobile Modular’s customer requirements are to fill temporary space needs, Mobile Modular’s marketing emphasis is on rentals rather than sales. Mobile Modular attracts customers through its website at www.mobilemodular.com, internet advertising and direct marketing. Customers are encouraged to visit a regional sales and inventory center to view different models on display and to see a regional office, which is a working example of a modular application. Because service is a major competitive factor in the rental of modulars, Mobile Modular offers quick response to requests for information, assistance in the choice of a suitable size and floor plan, in-house customization services, rapid delivery, timely installation and field service of its units. On Mobile Modular’s website, customers are able to view and select inventory for quotation and request in-field service. Rentals Rental periods range from one month to several years with a typical initial contract term between twelve and twenty-four months. In general, monthly rental rates are determined by a number of factors including length of term, market demand, product availability and product type. Upon expiration of the initial term, or any extensions, rental rates are reviewed, and when appropriate, are adjusted based on current market conditions. Most rental agreements are operating leases that provide no purchase options, and when a rental agreement does provide the customer with a purchase option, it is generally on terms management believes to be attractive to Mobile Modular. The customer is responsible for obtaining the necessary use permits and for the costs of insuring the unit, and is financially responsible for transporting the unit to the site, preparation of the site, installation of the unit, dismantle and return delivery of the unit to Mobile Modular, and certain costs for customization. Mobile Modular maintains the units in good working condition while on rent. -6- Upon return, the units are inspected for damage and customers are billed for items considered beyond normal wear and tear. Generally, the units are then repaired for subsequent use. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred and can include floor repairs, roof maintenance, cleaning, painting and other cosmetic repairs. The costs of major refurbishment of equipment are capitalized to the extent the refurbishment significantly improves the quality and adds value or life to the equipment. At December 31, 2021, Mobile Modular owned 65,673 new or previously rented modulars and portable storage containers with an aggregate cost of $1,040.1 million including accessories, or an average cost per unit of $15,837. Utilization is calculated at the end of each month by dividing the cost of rental equipment on rent by the total cost of rental equipment, excluding new equipment inventory and accessory equipment. At December 31, 2021, fleet utilization was 76.4% and average fleet utilization during 2021 was 76.2%. The Mobile Modular segment includes the results of operations of Mobile Modular Portable Storage and Kitchens To Go, which represented approximately 10% and 1% of the Company’s 2021 total revenues, respectively. The Company acquired the assets of Kitchens To Go on April 1, 2021, which provide interim and permanent modular kitchen solutions for foodservice providers that require flexible facilities to continue or expand operations. Sales In addition to operating its rental fleet, Mobile Modular sells modulars to customers. These sales may arise out of its marketing efforts for the rental fleet and from existing equipment already on rent or from specific requests for new buildings for a permanent need. The Company has a dedicated team that focuses on these custom sale opportunities. Such sales can be of either new or used units from the rental fleet, which permits some turnover of older units. During 2021 Mobile Modular’s largest sale represented approximately 4% of Mobile Modular’s sales, 2% of the Company’s consolidated sales and less than 1% of the Company’s consolidated revenues. Mobile Modular typically provides limited 90-day warranties on used modulars and passes through the manufacturers’ one-year warranty on new units to its customers. Warranty costs have not been significant to Mobile Modular’s operations to date, and the Company attributes this to its commitment to high quality standards and regular maintenance programs. However, there can be no assurance that warranty costs will continue to be insignificant to Mobile Modular’s operations in the future. Enviroplex manufactures portable classrooms built to the requirements of the California Division of the State Architect (“DSA”) and sells directly to California public school districts and other educational institutions. Seasonality Typically, during each calendar year, our highest numbers of classrooms are shipped for rental and sale orders during the second and third quarters for delivery and installation prior to the start of the upcoming school year. The majority of classrooms shipped in the second and third quarters have rental start dates during the third quarter, thereby making the fourth quarter the first full quarter of rental revenues recognized for these transactions. Competition Competition in the rental and sale of relocatable modular buildings is intense. Some of our competitors in the modular building leasing industry, notably WillScot Corporation (which merged with Mobile Mini in July 2020), have a greater range of products and services, greater financial and marketing resources, larger customer bases, and greater name recognition than we have. In addition, a number of other smaller companies operate regionally throughout the country. Mobile Modular operates primarily in California, the Pacific Northwest, Texas, Florida, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, Maryland and Washington, D.C. Significant competitive factors in the rental business include availability, price, service, reliability, appearance and functionality of the product. Mobile Modular markets high quality, well-constructed and attractive modulars. Part of the Company’s strategy for modulars is to create facilities and infrastructure capabilities that its competitors cannot easily duplicate. The Company's facilities and related infrastructure enable it to modify modulars efficiently and cost effectively to meet its customers’ needs. Management's goal is to be more responsive at less expense. Management believes this strategy, together with its emphasis on prompt and efficient customer service, gives Mobile Modular a competitive advantage. Mobile Modular is determined to respond quickly to requests for information, and provide experienced assistance for the first-time user, rapid delivery and timely repair of its modular units. Mobile Modular’s already high level of efficiency and responsiveness continues to improve as the Company upgrades procedures, processes and computer systems that control its internal operations. The Company anticipates intense competition to continue and believes it must continue to improve its products and services to remain competitive in the market for modulars. Classroom Rentals and Sales to Public Schools (K-12) Mobile Modular and Enviroplex provide classroom and specialty space needs serving public and private schools, colleges and universities. Within the educational market, the rental (by Mobile Modular) and sale (by Enviroplex and Mobile Modular) of modulars to public school districts for use as portable classrooms, restroom buildings and administrative offices for kindergarten through grade -7- twelve (K-12) are a significant portion of the Company’s revenues. Mobile Modular rents and sells classrooms in California , the Pacific Northwest , Florida, Texas, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C. Enviroplex sells classrooms in the California market. California is Mobile Modular’s largest educational market. Historically, demand in this market has been fueled by shifting and fluctuating student populations, insufficient funding for new school construction, class size reduction programs, modernization of aging school facilities and the phasing out of portable classrooms no longer compliant with current building codes. The following table shows the approximate percentages of the Company’s modular rental and sales revenues, and of its consolidated rental and sales revenues for the past five years, that rentals and sales to these schools constitute: Rentals and Sales to Public Schools (K-12) as a Percentage of Total Rental and Sales Revenues Percentage of: 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 Modular Rental Revenues (Mobile Modular) 28% 33% 32% 33% 33% Modular Sales Revenues (Mobile Modular & Enviroplex) 49% 48% 64% 70% 76% Modular Rental and Sales Revenues (Mobile Modular & Enviroplex) 34% 38% 42% 44% 47% Consolidated Rental and Sales Revenues 1 21% 23% 25% 24% 26% 1 Consolidated Rental and Sales Revenue percentage is calculated by dividing Modular rental and sales revenues to public schools (K-12) by the Company’s consolidated rental and sales revenues. School Facility Funding Funding for public school facilities is derived from a variety of sources including the passage of both statewide and local facility bond measures, operating budgets, developer fees, various taxes including parcel and sales taxes levied to support school operating budgets, and lottery funds. There is no certainty on the timing of the bond sales and it could take additional years before projects funded by these bonds generate meaningful demand for relocatable classrooms. -8- ELECTRONIC TEST EQUIPMENT Description TRS-RenTelco rents and sells electronic test equipment nationally and internationally from two facilities located on the grounds of the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport in Grapevine, Texas (the “Dallas facility”) and Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Canada (the “Montreal facility”). TRS-RenTelco’s revenues are derived from the rental and sale of general purpose and communications test equipment to a broad range of companies, from Fortune 500 to middle and smaller market companies, in the aerospace, defense, communications, manufacturing and semiconductor industries. Electronic test equipment revenues are primarily affected by the business activity within these industries related to research and development, manufacturing, and communication infrastructure installation and maintenance. The Dallas facility, TRS-RenTelco’s primary operating location, houses the electronic test equipment inventory, sales engineers, calibration laboratories, and operations staff for U.S. and international business. The Montreal facility houses sales engineers and operations staff to serve the Canadian market. As of December 31, 2021, the original cost of electronic test equipment inventory was comprised of 79% general purpose electronic test equipment and 21% communications electronic test equipment. Engineers, technicians and scientists utilize general purpose electronic test equipment in developing products, controlling manufacturing processes, completing field service applications and evaluating the performance of their own electrical and electronic equipment. These instruments are rented primarily to aerospace, defense, electronics, industrial, research and semiconductor industries. To date, Keysight Technologies, Rhode & Schwarz and Tektronix, a division of Fortive Corporation, have manufactured the majority of TRS-RenTelco’s general purpose electronic test equipment with the remainder acquired from over 60 other manufacturers. Communications test equipment, including fiber optic test equipment, is utilized by technicians, engineers and installation contractors to evaluate voice, data and multimedia communications networks, to install fiber optic cabling, and in the development and manufacturing of transmission, network and wireless products. These instruments are rented primarily to manufacturers of communications equipment and products, electrical and communications installation contractors, field technicians, and service providers. To date, Anritsu, Viavi Solutions and Fluke Networks, a division of Fortive Corporation, have manufactured a significant portion of TRS-RenTelco’s communications test equipment, with the remainder acquired from over 40 other manufacturers. TRS-RenTelco’s general purpose test equipment rental inventory includes oscilloscopes, amplifiers, analyzers (spectrum, network and logic), signal source and power source test equipment. The communications test equipment rental inventory includes network and transmission test equipment for various fiber, copper and wireless networks. TRS-RenTelco occasionally rents electronic test equipment from other rental companies and re-rents the equipment to customers. Competitive Strengths Market Leadership - The Company believes that TRS-RenTelco is one of the largest electronic test equipment rental and leasing companies offering a broad and deep selection of general purpose and communications test equipment for rent in North America. Expertise - The Company believes that its knowledge of products, technology and applications expertise provides it with a competitive advantage over others in the industry. Customer requirements are supported by application engineers and technicians that are knowledgeable about the equipment’s uses to ensure the right equipment is selected to meet the customer’s needs. This knowledge can be attributed to the experience of TRS-RenTelco’s management, sales and operational teams. Operating Structure - TRS-RenTelco is supported by a centralized distribution and inventory center on the grounds of the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport in Texas. The Company believes that the centralization of servicing all customers in North America and internationally by TRS-RenTelco’s experienced logistics teams provides a competitive advantage by minimizing transaction costs and enabling TRS-RenTelco to ensure customer requirements are met. Asset Management - TRS-RenTelco’s rental equipment inventory is serviced by an ISO 9001-2015 registered and compliant calibration laboratory that repairs and calibrates equipment ensuring that off rent equipment is ready to ship immediately to meet customers’ needs. TRS-RenTelco’s team of technicians, product managers and sales personnel are continuously monitoring and analyzing the utilization of existing products, new technologies, general economic conditions and estimates of customer demand to ensure the right equipment is purchased and sold, at the right point in the equipment’s technology life cycle. The Company believes this enables it to maximize utilization of equipment and the cash flow generated by the rental and sales revenue of each model of equipment. TRS-RenTelco strives to maintain strong relationships with equipment manufacturers, which enables it to leverage those relationships to gain rental opportunities. Customer Service - The Company believes that its focus on providing excellent service to its customers provides a competitive advantage. TRS-RenTelco strives to provide exemplary service to fulfill its commitments to its customers. TRS-RenTelco prides itself -9- in providing solutions to meet customers’ needs by having equipment available and responding quickly and thoroughly to their requests. TRS-RenTelco’s sophisticated in-house laboratory ensures the equipment is fully functional and meets its customers’ delivery requirements. Service needs of TRS-RenTelco’s customers are supported 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by its customer care specialists. TRS-RenTelco’s goal is to provide service beyond its customers’ expectations, which, the Company believes, results in customer loyalty and repeat business. Market Electronic test equipment rental is a market which we estimate has equipment on rent worldwide or available for rent with an aggregate original cost in excess of $1 billion. There is a broad customer base for the rental of such instruments, including aerospace, communications, defense, electrical contractor, electronics, industrial, installer contractor, network systems and research companies. TRS-RenTelco markets its electronic test equipment throughout the United States, Canada, and, to a limited extent, other countries. TRS-RenTelco attracts customers through its outside sales force, website at www.TRSRenTelco.com, telemarketing program, trade show participation, paid internet search and electronic mail campaigns. A key part of the sales process is TRS-RenTelco’s knowledgeable inside sales engineering team that effectively matches test equipment solutions to meet specific customer’s requirements. The Company believes that customers rent electronic test equipment for many reasons. Customers frequently need equipment for short-term projects, to evaluate new products, and for backup to avoid costly downtime. Delivery times for the purchase of such equipment can be lengthy; thus, renting allows the customer to obtain the equipment expeditiously. The Company also believes that the relative certainty of rental costs can facilitate cost control and be useful in the bidding of and pass-through of contract costs. Finally, renting rather than purchasing may better satisfy the customer’s budgetary constraints. Rentals TRS-RenTelco rents electronic test equipment typically for rental periods of one to six months, although in some instances, rental terms can be up to a year or longer. Monthly rental rates typically are between 2% and 10% of the current manufacturers’ list price. TRS-RenTelco depreciates its equipment over 1 to 8 years with no residual value. At December 31, 2021, TRS-RenTelco had an electronic test equipment rental inventory including accessories with an aggregate cost of $361.4 million. Utilization is calculated each month by dividing the cost of the rental equipment on rent by the total cost of rental equipment, excluding accessory equipment. Utilization was 62.9% as of December 31, 2021 and averaged 67.0% during the year. Sales Profit from equipment sales is a material component of TRS-RenTelco’s overall annual earnings. Gross profit from sales of both used and new equipment over the last five years generally has ranged from approximately 20% to 23% of total annual gross profit for our electronics division. For 2021, gross profit on equipment sales was approximately 21% of total division gross profit. Equipment sales are driven by the turnover of older technology rental equipment, to maintain target utilization at a model number level, and new equipment sales opportunities. In 2021, approximately 16% of the electronic test equipment revenues were derived from sales. The largest electronic test equipment sale during 2021 represented 5% of electronic test equipment sales, 1% of the Company’s consolidated sales and less than 1% of consolidated revenues. There is intense competition in the sales of electronic test equipment from a world-wide network of test equipment brokers and resellers, legacy rental companies, and equipment manufacturers. We believe the annual world-wide sales of electronic test equipment is in excess of $8.0 billion per year. Seasonality Rental activity may decline in the fourth quarter month of December and the first quarter months of January and February. These months may have lower rental activity due to holiday closures, particularly by larger companies, inclement weather and its impact on various field related communications equipment rentals, and companies’ operational recovery from holiday closures which may impact the start-up of new projects coming online in the first quarter. These factors may impact the quarterly results of each year’s first and fourth quarter. Competition The electronic test equipment rental business is characterized by intense competition from several competitors, including Electro Rent Corporation, Continental Resources, and TestEquity, some of which may have access to greater financial and other resources than we do. TRS-RenTelco competes with these and other test equipment rental companies on the basis of product availability, price, service and reliability. Although no single competitor holds a dominant market share, we face intense competition from these established entities and new entrants in the market. Some of our competitors may offer similar equipment for lease, rental or sales at lower prices and may offer more extensive servicing, or financing options. -10- LIQUID AND SOLID CONTAINMENT TANKS AND BOXES Description Adler Tanks’ rental inventory is comprised of tanks and boxes used for various containment solutions to store hazardous and non-hazardous liquids and solids in applications such as: refinery, chemical and industrial plant maintenance, environmental remediation and field services, infrastructure building construction, marine services, oil and gas exploration and field services, pipeline construction and maintenance, tank terminals services, wastewater treatment, and waste management and landfill services.

Adler Tanks purchases tanks and boxes from various manufacturers located throughout the country. Competitive Strengths Market Leadership - The Company believes that Adler Tanks is one of the largest participants in the liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes rental business in North America. Adler Tanks has national reach from branches serving the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, Southeast, Southwest and West. Expertise and Customer Service – The Company believes that Adler Tanks has highly experienced operating management and branch employees. Adler Tanks employees are knowledgeable about the operation of its rental equipment and customer applications. The Company believes that Adler Tanks provides a superior level of customer service due to its strong relationship building skills and the quality of its responsiveness. Asset Management – The Company believes that Adler Tanks markets a high quality, well-constructed and well-maintained rental product. The Company depreciates its tanks and boxes over a 20 year estimated useful life to 0% residual value. We believe that if maintained, older tanks and boxes will continue to produce similar rental rates as newer equipment. The fleet’s utilization is regionally optimized by understanding key vertical market customer demand, seasonality factors, competitor’s product availability and expected equipment returns. Market Liquid and solid containment equipment rental is a market in the U.S with a large and diverse number of market segments including refinery, chemical and industrial plant maintenance, environmental remediation and field services, infrastructure building construction, marine services, oil and gas exploration and field services, pipeline construction and maintenance, electrical grid transformer maintenance, tank terminals services, wastewater treatment, and waste management and landfill services. The tank and box rental products may be utilized throughout the U.S. and are not subject to any local or regional construction code or approval standards. Rentals Adler Tanks rents tanks and boxes typically for rental periods of one to six months, although in some instances, rental terms can be up to a year or longer. Monthly rental rates typically are between 2% and 10% of the equipment’s original acquisition cost. At December 31, 2021, Adler Tanks had rental equipment inventory including accessories with an aggregate cost of $309.9 million. Utilization is calculated each month by dividing the cost of the rental equipment on rent by the total cost of rental equipment, excluding accessory equipment. Utilization was 47.6% at December 31, 2021 and averaged 45.4% during the year. Seasonality Rental activity may decline in the fourth quarter month of December and the first quarter months of January and February. These months may have lower rental activity due to inclement weather in certain regions of the country impacting the industries that we serve. -11- Competition The liquid and solid containment rental industry is highly competitive including national, regional and local companies. Some of our national competitors, notably United Rentals, Rain For Rent and Mobile Mini (merged with WillScot in July 2020), may be larger than we are and may have greater financial and other resources than we have. Some of our competitors also have longer operating histories and lower cost basis of rental equipment than we have. In addition, certain of our competitors are more geographically diverse than we are and have greater name recognition among customers than we do. As a result, our competitors that have these advantages may be better able to attract and retain customers and provide their products and services at lower rental rates. Adler Tanks competes with these companies based upon product availability, product quality, price, service and reliability. We may encounter increased competition in the markets that we serve from existing competitors or from new market entrants in the future.

RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the following discussion of various risks and uncertainties. We believe these risk factors are the most relevant to our business and could cause our results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made by us. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be seriously harmed if any of these risks or uncertainties actually occur or materialize. In that event, the market price for our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. RISKS RELATED TO OUR STRATEGY AND OPERATION: Our future operating results may fluctuate, fail to match past performance or fail to meet expectations, which may result in a decrease in our stock price. Our operating results may fluctuate in the future, may fail to match our past performance or fail to meet the expectations of analysts and investors. Our results and related ratios, such as gross margin, operating income percentage and effective tax rate may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control including but not limited to: • general economic conditions in the geographies and industries where we rent and sell our products; • legislative and educational policies where we rent and sell our products; • the budgetary constraints of our customers; • seasonality of our rental businesses and our end-markets; • success of our strategic growth initiatives; • costs associated with the launching or integration of new or acquired businesses; • the timing and type of equipment purchases, rentals and sales; • the nature and duration of the equipment needs of our customers; • the timing of new product introductions by us, our suppliers and our competitors; • the volume, timing and mix of maintenance and repair work on our rental equipment; • supply chain delays or disruptions; • our equipment mix, availability, utilization and pricing; • the mix, by state and country, of our revenues, personnel and assets; • rental equipment impairment from excess, obsolete or damaged equipment; • movements in interest rates or tax rates; • changes in, and application of, accounting rules; • changes in the regulations applicable to us; and • litigation matters. As a result of these factors, our historical financial results are not necessarily indicative of our future results or stock price. Our stock price has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate in the future, which may result in a decline in the value of your investment in our common stock. The market price of our common stock fluctuates on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and is likely to be affected by a number of factors including but not limited to: • our operating performance and the performance of our competitors, and in particular any variations in our operating results or dividend rate from our stated guidance or from investors’ expectations; • any changes in general conditions in the global economy, the industries in which we operate or the global financial markets; • investors’ reaction to our press releases, public announcements or filings with the SEC; • the stock price performance of our competitors or other comparable companies; -15- • any changes in research analysts’ coverage, recommendations or earnings estimates for us or for the stocks of other companies in our industry; • any sales of common stock by our directors, executive officers and our other large shareholders, particularly in light of the limited trading volume of our stock; • any merger and acquisition activity that involves us or our competitors; and • other announcements or developments affecting us, our industry, customers, suppliers or competitors. In addition, in recent years the U.S. stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations are often unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. Additionally, the most recent global credit crisis adversely affected the prices of most publicly traded stocks as many stockholders became more willing to divest their stock holdings at lower values to increase their cash flow and reduce exposure to such fluctuations. These broad market fluctuations and any other negative economic trends may cause declines in the market price of our common stock and may be based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our Company or its performance, and these fluctuations and trends could materially reduce our stock price. The impact of COVID-19 on our operations, and the operations of our customers, suppliers and logistics providers, may harm our business. We continue to monitor the ongoing impact of COVID-19 outbreak around the globe. This includes evaluating the impact on our customers, suppliers, and logistics providers as well as evaluating governmental actions being taken to curtail the spread of the virus. Significant uncertainty continues to exist concerning the magnitude of the impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and related variants. While the Company’s operating segments and branch locations currently continue to operate, the Company’s results of operations may be negatively impacted by project delays, supply chain delays or disruptions; elevated costs for materials and labor; early returns of equipment currently on rent with customers; overall decreased customer demand for new rental orders, rental related services and sales of new and used rental equipment; and payment delay, or non-payment, by customers who are significantly impacted by COVID-19 . Our ability to retain our executive management and to recruit, retain and motivate key qualified employees is critical to the success of our business. If we cannot successfully recruit and retain qualified personnel, our operating results and stock price may suffer. We believe that our success is directly linked to the competent people in our organization, including our executive officers, senior managers and other key personnel, and in particular, Joe Hanna, our Chief Executive Officer. Personnel turnover can be costly and could materially and adversely impact our operating results and can potentially jeopardize the success of our current strategic initiatives. We need to attract and retain highly qualified personnel to replace personnel when turnover occurs, as well as add to our staff levels as growth occurs. Our business and stock price likely will suffer if we are unable to fill, or experience delays in filling open positions, or fail to retain key personnel. Failure by third parties to manufacture and deliver our products to our specifications or on a timely basis may harm our reputation and financial condition. We depend on third parties to manufacture our products even though we are able to purchase products from a variety of third-party suppliers. In the future, we may be limited as to the number of third-party suppliers for some of our products. Although in general we make advance purchases of some products to help ensure an adequate supply, currently we do not have any long-term purchase contracts with any third-party supplier. We may experience supply problems as a result of financial or operating difficulties or failure of our suppliers, or shortages and discontinuations resulting from product obsolescence or other shortages or allocations by our suppliers. Unfavorable economic conditions may also adversely affect our suppliers or the terms on which we purchase products. In the future, we may not be able to negotiate arrangements with third parties to secure products that we require in sufficient quantities or on reasonable terms. If we cannot negotiate arrangements with third parties to produce our products or if the third parties fail to produce our products to our specifications or in a timely manner, our reputation and financial condition could be harmed. We are subject to information technology system failures, network disruptions and breaches in data security which could subject us to liability, reputational damage or interrupt the operation of our business. We rely upon our information technology systems and infrastructure for our business. We sustained an immaterial cybersecurity attack in 2021 involving ransomware that impacted certain of our systems, but was unsuccessful in its ability to disrupt our network. Our investigation revealed that an unauthorized third party copied some personal information relating to certain current and former employees, directors, contractor workers and their dependents and certain other persons. Upon detection, we promptly undertook steps -16- to address the incident, restored network systems and resumed normal operations. The attack did not result in any material disruption to our operations or ability to service our customers, and did not affect our financial performance. In the future, we could experience additional breaches of our security measures resulting in the theft of confidential information or reputational damage from industrial espionage attacks, malware or other cyber-attacks, which may compromise our system infrastructure or lead to data leakage, either internally or at our third-party providers. Similarly, additional data privacy breaches by those who access our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to us, our employees, customers or other business partners, may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. The immaterial breach of our information technology system and any future breaches could subject us to reputational damage. Cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and have become increasingly difficult to detect. There can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our data and information technology systems will prevent future breaches in our systems (or that of our third-party providers) that could adversely affect our business and result in financial and reputational harm to us, theft of trade secrets and other proprietary information, legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties. Disruptions in our information technology systems or failure to protect these systems against security breaches could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Additionally, if these systems fail, become unavailable for any period of time or are not upgraded, this could limit our ability to effectively monitor and control our operations and adversely affect our operations. Our information technology systems facilitate our ability to transact business, monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions. We sustained an immaterial cybersecurity attack in 2021 involving ransomware that impacted certain of our systems, but was unsuccessful in its ability to disrupt our network. Upon detection, we promptly undertook steps to address the incident, restored network systems and resumed normal operations. Any future cybersecurity attack causing disruption in our information technology systems or the failure of these systems to operate as expected could, depending on the magnitude of the problem, adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively transact business, monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions in a timely manner. In addition, because of recent advances in technology and well-known efforts on the part of computer hackers and cyber-terrorists to breach data security of companies, we face risks associated with failure to adequately protect critical corporate, customer and employee data, which could adversely impact our customer relationships, our reputation, and even violate privacy laws. As part of our business, we develop, receive and retain confidential data about our company and our customers. Further, the delay or failure to implement information system upgrades and new systems effectively could disrupt our business, distract management’s focus and attention from our business operations and growth initiatives, and increase our implementation and operating costs, any of which could negatively impact our operations and operating results. We have engaged in acquisitions and may engage in future acquisitions that could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and business. In the second quarter 2021, we acquired the assets of Design Space Modular Buildings PNW, LP (“Design Space”), a provider of modular buildings and portable storage containers for rental and sale to customers in the West and Pacific Northwest states in the U.S. and GRS Holding LLC, DBA Kitchens to Go (“Kitchens To Go”), a provider of interim and permanent modular solutions for foodservice providers that require flexible facilities to continue or expand operations. We anticipate that we will continue to consider acquisitions in the future that meet our strategic growth plans. We are unable to predict whether or when any prospective acquisition will be completed. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following: • difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired companies; • diversion of management’s attention from normal daily operations of our business; • difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets may have stronger market positions; • difficulties in complying with regulations applicable to any acquired business, such as environmental regulations, and managing risks related to an acquired business; • timely completion of necessary financing and required amendments, if any, to existing agreements; • an inability to implement uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies; • undiscovered and unknown problems, defects, damaged assets liabilities, or other issues related to any acquisition that become known to us only after the acquisition; -17- • negative reactions from our customers to an acquisition; • disruptions among employees related to any acquisition which may erode employee morale; • loss of key employees, including costly litigation resulting from the termination of those employees; • an inability to realize cost efficiencies or synergies that we may anticipate when selecting acquisition candidates; • recording of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to future impairment testing and potential periodic impairment charges; • incurring amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets; and • becoming subject to litigation. Acquisitions are inherently risky, and no assurance can be given that our recent and future acquisitions will be successful or will not adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. The success of our acquisition strategy depends upon our ability to successfully complete acquisitions and integrate any businesses that we acquire into our existing business. The difficulties of integration could be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically dispersed organizations; maintaining acceptable standards, controls, procedures and policies; integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds; combining different corporate cultures; and the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management and other personnel. In addition, if we consummate one or more significant future acquisitions in which the consideration consists of stock or other securities, our existing shareholders’ ownership could be diluted significantly. If we were to proceed with one or more significant future acquisitions in which the consideration included cash, we could be required to use, to the extent available, a substantial portion of our Credit Facility. If we increase the amount borrowed against our available credit line, we would increase the risk of breaching the covenants under our credit facilities with our lenders. In addition, it would limit our ability to make other investments, or we may be required to seek additional debt or equity financing. Any of these items could adversely affect our results of operations. If we determine that our goodwill and intangible assets have become impaired, we may incur impairment charges, which would negatively impact our operating results. At December 31, 2021, we had $179.4 million of goodwill and intangible assets, net, on our consolidated balance sheets. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, we assess potential impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets at least annually, as well as on an interim basis to the extent that factors or indicators become apparent that could reduce the fair value of any of our businesses below book value. Impairment may result from significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired asset, negative industry or economic trends and significant underperformance relative to historic or projected operating results. Our rental equipment is subject to residual value risk upon disposition, and may not sell at the prices or in the quantities we expect. The market value of any given piece of rental equipment could be less than its depreciated value at the time it is sold. The market value of used rental equipment depends on several factors, including: • the market price for new equipment of a like kind; • the age of the equipment at the time it is sold, as well as wear and tear on the equipment relative to its age; • the supply of used equipment on the market; • technological advances relating to the equipment; • worldwide and domestic demand for used equipment; and • general economic conditions. We include in income from operations the difference between the sales price and the depreciated value of an item of equipment sold. Changes in our assumptions regarding depreciation could change our depreciation expense, as well as the gain or loss realized upon disposal of equipment. Sales of our used rental equipment at prices that fall significantly below our projections or in lesser quantities than we anticipate will have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. -18- If we do not effectively manage our credit risk, collect on our accounts receivable or recover our rental equipment from our customers’ sites, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We generally rent and sell to customers on 30 day payment terms, individually perform credit evaluation procedures on our customers for each transaction and require security deposits or other forms of security from our customers when a significant credit risk is identified. Historically, accounts receivable write-offs and write-offs related to equipment not returned by customers have not been significant and have averaged less than 1% of total revenues over the last five years. If economic conditions deteriorate, we may see an increase in bad debt relative to historical levels, which may materially and adversely affect our operations. Business segments that experience significant market disruptions or declines may experience increased customer credit risk and higher bad debt expense. Failure to manage our credit risk and receive timely payments on our customer accounts receivable may result in write-offs and/or loss of equipment, particularly electronic test equipment. If we are not able to effectively manage credit risk issues, or if a large number of our customers should have financial difficulties at the same time, our receivables and equipment losses could increase above historical levels. If this should occur, our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. Effective management of our rental assets is vital to our business. If we are not successful in these efforts, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Our modular, electronics and liquid and solid containment rental products have long useful lives and managing those assets is a critical element to each of our rental businesses. Generally, we design units and find manufacturers to build them to our specifications for our modular and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes. Modular asset management requires designing and building the product for a long life that anticipates the needs of our customers, including anticipating potential changes in legislation, regulations, building codes and local permitting in the various markets in which the Company operates. Electronic test equipment asset management requires understanding, selecting and investing in equipment technologies that support market demand, including anticipating technological advances and changes in manufacturers’ selling prices. Liquid and solid containment asset management requires designing and building the product for a long life, using quality components and repairing and maintaining the products to prevent leaks. For each of our modular, electronic test equipment and liquid and solid containment assets, we must successfully maintain and repair this equipment cost-effectively to maximize the useful life of the products and the level of proceeds from the sale of such products. To the extent that we are unable to do so, our result of operations could be materially adversely affected. The nature of our businesses, including the ownership of industrial property, exposes us to the risk of litigation and liability under environmental, health and safety and products liability laws. Violations of environmental or health and safety related laws or associated liability could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to national, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, solid and liquid waste and hazardous substances handling, storage and disposal and employee health and safety. These laws and regulations are complex and frequently change. We could incur unexpected costs, penalties and other civil and criminal liability if we fail to comply with applicable environmental or health and safety laws. We also could incur costs or liabilities related to waste disposal or remediating soil or groundwater contamination at our properties, at our customers’ properties or at third party landfill and disposal sites. These liabilities can be imposed on the parties generating, transporting or disposing of such substances or on the owner or operator of any affected property, often without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous substances. Several aspects of our businesses involve risks of environmental and health and safety liability. For example, our operations involve the use of petroleum products, solvents and other hazardous substances in the construction and maintaining of modular buildings and for fueling and maintaining our delivery trucks and vehicles. We also own, transport and rent tanks and boxes in which waste materials are placed by our customers. The historical operations at some of our previously or currently owned or leased and newly acquired or leased properties may have resulted in undiscovered soil or groundwater contamination or historical non-compliance by third parties for which we could be held liable. Future events, such as changes in existing laws or policies or their enforcement, or the discovery of currently unknown contamination or non-compliance, may also give rise to liabilities or other claims based on these operations that may be material. In addition, compliance with future environmental or health and safety laws and regulations may require significant capital or operational expenditures or changes to our operations. Accordingly, in addition to potential penalties for non-compliance, we may become liable, either contractually or by operation of law, for investigation, remediation and monitoring costs even if the contaminated property is not presently owned or operated by us, or if the contamination was caused by third parties during or prior to our ownership or operation of the property. In addition, certain parties may be held liable for more than their “fair” share of environmental investigation and cleanup costs. Contamination and exposure to hazardous substances or other contaminants such as mold can also result in claims for remediation or damages, including personal injury, property damage, and natural resources damage claims. Although expenses related to environmental compliance, health and safety issues, and related matters have not been material to date, we cannot assure that we will not have to make significant expenditures in -19- the future in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Violations of environmental or health and safety related laws or associated liability could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In general, litigation in the industries in which we operate, including class actions that seek substantial damages, arises with increasing frequency. Enforcement of environmental and health and safety requirements is also frequent. Such proceedings are invariably expensive, regardless of the merit of the plaintiffs’ or prosecutors’ claims. We may be named as a defendant in the future, and there can be no assurance, irrespective of the merit of such future actions, that we will not be required to make substantial settlement payments in the future. Further, a significant portion of our business is conducted in California which is one of the most highly regulated and litigious states in the country. Therefore, our potential exposure to losses and expenses due to new laws, regulations or litigation may be greater than companies with a less significant California presence. The nature of our business also subjects us to property damage and product liability claims, especially in connection with our modular buildings and tank and box rental businesses. Although we maintain liability coverage that we believe is commercially reasonable, an unusually large property damage or product liability claim or a series of claims could exceed our insurance coverage or result in damage to our reputation. Our routine business activities expose us to risk of litigation from employees, vendors and other third parties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We may be subject to claims arising from disputes with employees, vendors and other third parties in the normal course of our business; these risks may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. If the plaintiffs in any suits against us were to successfully prosecute their claims, or if we were to settle any such suits by making significant payments to the plaintiffs, our operating results and financial condition would be harmed. Even if the outcome of a claim proves favorable to us, litigation can be time consuming and costly and may divert management resources. In addition, our organizational documents require us to indemnify our senior executives to the maximum extent permitted by California law. We maintain directors’ and officers’ liability insurance that we believe is commercially reasonable in connection with such obligations, but if our senior executives were named in any lawsuit, our indemnification obligations could magnify the costs of these suits and/or exceed the coverage of such policies. If we suffer loss to our facilities, equipment or distribution system due to catastrophe, our insurance policies could be inadequate or depleted, our operations could be seriously harmed, which could negatively affect our operating results. Our facilities, rental equipment and distribution systems may be subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, hurricane, earthquake, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters. In particular, our headquarters, three operating facilities, and certain of our rental equipment are located in areas of California, with above average seismic activity and could be subject to catastrophic loss caused by an earthquake. Our rental equipment and facilities in Texas, Louisiana, Florida, North Carolina and Georgia are located in areas subject to hurricanes and other tropical storms. In addition to customers’ insurance on rented equipment, we carry property insurance on our rental equipment in inventory and operating facilities as well as business interruption insurance. We believe our insurance policies have adequate limits and deductibles to mitigate the potential loss exposure of our business. We do not maintain financial reserves for policy deductibles and our insurance policies contain exclusions that are customary for our industry, including exclusions for earthquakes, flood and terrorism. If any of our facilities or a significant amount of our rental equipment were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay orders, shipments and revenue recognition and result in expenses to repair or replace the damaged rental equipment and facility not covered by insurance, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. INTEREST RATE AND INDEBTEDNESS RISKS: Our debt instruments contain covenants that restrict or prohibit our ability to enter into a variety of transactions and may limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs. If we have an event of default under these instruments, our indebtedness could be accelerated and we may not be able to refinance such indebtedness or make the required accelerated payments. The agreements governing our Series C, D and E Senior Notes (as defined and more fully described under the heading “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources”) and our Credit Facility contain various covenants that limit our discretion in operating our business. In particular, we are limited in our ability to merge, consolidate, reorganize or transfer substantially all of our assets, make investments, pay dividends or distributions, redeem or repurchase stock, change the nature of our business, enter into transactions with affiliates, incur indebtedness and create liens on our assets to secure debt. In addition, we are required to meet certain financial covenants under these instruments. These restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financing, make strategic acquisitions or needed capital expenditures, withstand economic downturns in our business or the economy in general, conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise. -20- A failure to comply with the restrictions contained in these agreements could lead to an event of default, which could result in an acceleration of our indebtedness. In the event of an acceleration, we may not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to refinance our indebtedness or make any required accelerated payments. If we default on our indebtedness, our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The majority of our indebtedness is subject to variable interest rates, which makes us vulnerable to increases in interest rates, which could negatively affect our net income. Our indebtedness exposes us to interest rate increases because the majority of our indebtedness is subject to variable rates. At present, we do not have any derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps or hedges to mitigate interest rate variability. The interest rates under our credit facilities are reset at varying periods. These interest rate adjustments could cause periodic fluctuations in our operating results and cash flows. Our annual debt service obligations increase by approximately $2.7 million per year for each 1% increase in the average interest rate we pay based on the $266.5 million balance of variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2021. If interest rates rise in the future, and, particularly if they rise significantly, interest expense will increase and our net income will be negatively affected. GENERAL RISKS: Our effective tax rate may change and become less predictable as our business expands, or as a result of federal and state tax law changes, making our future earnings less predictable. We continue to consider expansion opportunities domestically and internationally for our rental businesses. Since the Company’s effective tax rate depends on business levels, personnel and assets located in various jurisdictions, further expansion into new markets or acquisitions may change the effective tax rate in the future and may make it, and consequently our earnings, less predictable going forward. Further, the enactment of future tax law changes by federal and state taxing authorities may impact the Company’s current period tax provision and its deferred tax liabilities. In addition, the amount and timing of stock-based compensation may also impact the Company’s current tax provision. Changes in financial accounting standards may cause lower than expected operating results and affect our reported results of operations. Changes in accounting standards and their application may have a significant effect on our reported results on a going-forward basis and may also affect the recording and disclosure of previously reported transactions. New accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred in the past and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business. SPECIFIC RISKS RELATED TO OUR RELOCATABLE MODULAR BUILDINGS BUSINESS SEGMENT: Significant reductions of, or delays in, funding to public schools have caused the demand and pricing for our modular classroom units to decline, which has in the past caused, and may cause in the future, a reduction in our revenues and profitability. Rentals and sales of modular buildings to public school districts for use as classrooms, restroom buildings, and administrative offices for K-12 represent a significant portion of Mobile Modular’s rental and sales revenues. Funding for public school facilities is derived from a variety of sources including the passage of both statewide and local facility bond measures, developer fees and various taxes levied to support school operating budgets. Many of these funding sources are subject to financial and political considerations, which vary from district to district and are not tied to demand. Historically, we have benefited from the passage of statewide and local facility bond measures and believe these are essential to our business. The state of California is our largest market for classroom rentals. The strength of this market depends heavily on public funding from voter passage of both state and local facility bond measures, and the ability of the state to sell such bonds in the public market. A lack of passage of state and local facility bond measures, or the inability to sell bonds in the public markets in the future could reduce our revenues and operating income, and consequently have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition. Furthermore, even if voters have approved facility bond measures and the state has raised bond funds, there is no guarantee that individual school projects will be funded in a timely manner. As a consequence of the most recent economic recession, many states and local governments experienced large budget deficits resulting in severe budgetary constraints among public school districts. To the extent public school districts’ funding is reduced for the rental and purchase of modular buildings, our business could be harmed and our results of operations negatively impacted. We believe that interruptions or delays in the passage of facility bond measures or completion of state budgets, an insufficient amount of state funding, a significant reduction of funding to public schools, or changes negatively impacting enrollment may reduce the rental and sale demand for our educational products. Any reductions in funding available to the school districts from the states in which we do business -21- may cause school districts to experience budget shortfalls and to reduce their demand for our products despite growing student populations, class size reduction initiatives and modernization and reconstruction project needs, which could reduce our revenues and operating income and consequently have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition. Public policies that create demand for our products and services may change, resulting in decreased demand for or the pricing of our products and services, which could negatively affect our revenues and operating income. Various states that we operate enacted laws and constitutional amendments to provide funding for school districts to limit the number of students that may be grouped in a single classroom. School districts with class sizes in excess of state limits have been and continue to be a significant source of our demand for modular classrooms. In California, efforts to address aging infrastructure and deferred maintenance have resulted in modernization and reconstruction projects by public school districts including seismic retrofitting, asbestos abatement and various building repairs and upgrades, which has been another source of demand for our modular classrooms. The most recent economic recession caused state and local budget shortfalls, which reduced school districts’ funding and their ability to comply with state class size reduction requirements. If educational priorities and policies shift away from class-size reduction or modernization and reconstruction projects, demand and pricing for our products and services may decline, not grow as quickly as, or not reach the levels that we anticipate. Significant equipment returns may result in lower utilization until equipment can be redeployed or sold, which may cause rental rates to decline and negatively affect our revenues and operating income. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could harm our business and financial condition, resulting in lower operating results and cash flows. Similar to conventionally constructed buildings, the modular building industry, including the manufacturers and lessors of portable classrooms, are subject to regulations by multiple governmental agencies at the federal, state and local level relating to environmental, zoning, health, safety, energy efficiency, labor and transportation matters, among other matters. Failure to comply with these laws or regulations could impact our business or harm our reputation and result in higher capital or operating expenditures or the imposition of penalties or restrictions on our operations. As with conventional construction, typically new codes and regulations are not retroactively applied. Nonetheless, new governmental regulations in these or other areas may increase our acquisition cost of new rental equipment, limit the use of or make obsolete some of our existing equipment, or increase our costs of rental operations. Building codes are generally reviewed every three years. All aspects of a given code are subject to change including, but not limited to, such items as structural specifications for earthquake safety, energy efficiency and environmental standards, fire and life safety, transportation, lighting and noise limits. Compliance with building codes and regulations entails a certain amount of risk as state and local government authorities do not necessarily interpret building codes and regulations in a consistent manner, particularly where applicable regulations may be unclear and subject to interpretation. These regulations often provide broad discretion to governmental authorities that oversee these matters, which can result in unanticipated delays or increases in the cost of compliance in particular markets. The construction and modular industries have developed many “best practices” which are constantly evolving. Some of our peers and competitors may adopt practices that are more or less stringent than the Company’s. When, and if, regulatory standards are clarified, the effect of the clarification may be to impose rules on our business and practices retroactively, at which time, we may not be in compliance with such regulations and we may be required to incur costly remediation. If we are unable to pass these increased costs on to our customers, our profitability, operating cash flows and financial condition could be negatively impacted. Expansions of our modular operations into new markets may negatively affect our operating results. In the past we have expanded our modular operations into new geographies and states. There are risks inherent in the undertaking of such expansion, including the risk of revenue from the business in any new markets not meeting our expectations, higher than expected costs in entering these new markets, risk associated with compliance with applicable state and local laws and regulations, response by competitors and unanticipated consequences of expansion. In addition, expansion into new markets may be affected by local economic and market conditions. Expansion of our operations into new markets will require a significant amount of attention from our management, a commitment of financial resources and will require us to add qualified management in these markets, which may negatively impact our operating results. -22- We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts. These laws and regulations make these government contracts more favorable to government entities than other third parties and any changes in these laws and regulations, or our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business. We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. For example, many government contracts contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts such as clauses that allow government entities not to perform on contractual obligations in the case of a lack of fiscal funding. Also, in the educational markets we serve, we are able to utilize “piggyback” contracts in marketing our products and services and ultimately to book business. The term “piggyback” contract refers to contracts for portable classrooms or other products entered into by public school districts following a formal bid process that allows for the use of the same contract terms and conditions with the successful vendor by other public school districts. As a result, “piggyback” contracts allow us to more readily book orders from our government customers, primarily public school districts, and to reduce the administrative expense associated with booking these orders. The governmental statutes and regulations that allow for use of “piggyback” contracts are subject to change or elimination in their entirety. A change in the manner of use or the elimination of “piggyback” contracts would likely negatively impact our ability to book new business from these government customers and could cause our administrative expenses related to processing these orders to increase significantly. In addition, any failure to comply with these laws and regulations might result in administrative penalties or even in the suspension of these contracts and as a result, the loss of the related revenues which would harm our business and results from operations. Seasonality of our educational business may have adverse consequences for our business. A significant portion of the modular sale and rental revenues is derived from the educational market. Typically, during each calendar year, our highest numbers of classrooms are shipped for rental and sale orders during the second and third quarters for delivery and installation prior to the start of the upcoming school year. The majority of classrooms shipped in the second and third quarters have rental start dates during the third quarter, thereby making the fourth quarter the first full quarter of rental revenues recognized for these transactions. Although this is the historical seasonality of our business, it is subject to change or may not meet our expectations, which may have adverse consequences for our business. We face strong competition in our modular building markets and we may not be able to effectively compete. The modular building leasing industry is highly competitive in our states of operation and we expect it to remain so. The competitive market in which we operate may prevent us from raising rental fees or sales prices to pass any increased costs on to our customers. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including equipment availability, quality, price, service, reliability, appearance, functionality and delivery terms. We may experience pricing pressures in our areas of operation in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing prices. Some of our competitors in the modular building leasing industry, notably WillScot Corporation, have a greater range of products and services, greater financial and marketing resources, larger customer bases, and greater name recognition than we have. WillScot Corporation completed the acquisition of Modspace in August, 2018 and Mobile Mini in July, 2020. These combined competitors may be better able to respond to changes in the relocatable modular building market, to finance acquisitions, to fund internal growth and to compete for market share, any of which could harm our business. We may not be able to quickly redeploy modular units returning from leases, which could negatively affect our financial performance and our ability to expand, or utilize, our rental fleet. As of December 31, 2021, 63% of our modular portfolio had equipment on rent for periods exceeding the original committed term. Generally, when a customer continues to rent the modular units beyond the contractual term, the equipment rents on a month-to-month basis. If a significant number of our rented modular units were returned during a short period of time, particularly those units that are rented on a month-to-month basis, a large supply of units would need to be remarketed. Our failure to effectively remarket a large influx of units returning from leases could negatively affect our financial performance and our ability to continue expanding our rental fleet. In addition, if returned units stay off rent for an extended period of time, we may incur additional costs to securely store and maintain them. Significant increases in raw material and labor costs could increase our acquisition cost of new modular rental units and repair and maintenance costs of our fleet, which would increase our operating costs and harm our profitability. We incur labor costs and purchase raw materials, including lumber, siding and roofing and other products to perform periodic repairs, modifications and refurbishments to maintain physical conditions of our modular units. The volume, timing and mix of maintenance and repair work on our rental equipment may vary quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. Generally, increases in labor and -23- raw material costs will also increase the acquisition cost of new modular units and increase the repair and maintenance costs of our fleet. We also maintain a fleet of service trucks and use subcontractor companies for the delivery, set-up, return delivery and dismantle of modulars for our customers. We rely on our subcontractor service companies to meet customer demands for timely shipment and return, and the loss or inadequate number of subcontractor service companies may cause prices to increase, while negatively impacting our reputation and operating performance. During periods of rising prices for labor, raw materials or fuel, and in particular, when the prices increase rapidly or to levels significantly higher than normal, we may incur significant increases in our acquisition costs for new modular units and incur higher operating costs that we may not be able to recoup from our customers, which would reduce our profitability. Failure by third parties to manufacture our products timely or properly may harm our reputation and financial condition. We are dependent on third parties to manufacture our products even though we are able to purchase products from a variety of third-party suppliers. Mobile Modular purchases new modulars from various manufacturers who build to Mobile Modular’s design specifications. With the exception of Enviroplex, none of the principal suppliers are affiliated with the Company. During 2021, Mobile Modular purchased 41% of its modular product from one manufacturer. The Company believes that the loss of any of its primary manufacturers of modulars could have an adverse effect on its operations since Mobile Modular could experience higher prices and longer delivery lead times for modular product until other manufacturers were able to increase their production capacity. Failure to properly design, manufacture, repair and maintain the modular product may result in impairment charges, potential litigation and reduction of our operating results and cash flows. We estimate the useful life of the modular product to be 18 years with a residual value of 50%. However, proper design, manufacture, repairs and maintenance of the modular product during our ownership is required for the product to reach the estimated useful life of 18 years with a residual value of 50%. If we do not appropriately manage the design, manufacture, repair and maintenance of our modular product, or otherwise delay or defer such repair or maintenance, we may be required to incur impairment charges for equipment that is beyond economic repair costs or incur significant capital expenditures to acquire new modular product to serve demand. In addition, such failures may result in personal injury or property damage claims, including claims based on presence of mold, and termination of leases or contracts by customers. Costs of contract performance, potential litigation, and profits lost from termination could accordingly reduce our future operating results and cash flows. Our warranty costs may increase and warranty claims could damage our reputation and negatively impact our revenues and operating income. Sales of new relocatable modular buildings not manufactured by us are typically covered by warranties provided by the manufacturer of the products sold. We provide ninety-day warranties on certain modular sales of used rental units and one-year warranties on equipment manufactured by our Enviroplex subsidiary. Historically, our warranty costs have not been significant, and we monitor the quality of our products closely. If a defect were to arise in the installation of our equipment at the customer’s facilities or in the equipment acquired from our suppliers or by our Enviroplex subsidiary, we may experience increased warranty claims. Such claims could disrupt our sales operations, damage our reputation and require costly repairs or other remedies, negatively impacting revenues and operating income. SPECIFIC RISKS RELATED TO OUR ELECTRONIC TEST EQUIPMENT BUSINESS SEGMENT: Market risk and cyclical downturns in the industries using test equipment may result in periods of low demand for our product resulting in excess inventory, impairment charges and reduction of our operating results and cash flows. TRS-RenTelco’s revenues are derived from the rental and sale of general purpose and communications test equipment to a broad range of companies, from Fortune 500 to middle and smaller market companies, in the aerospace, defense, communications, manufacturing and semiconductor industries. Electronic test equipment rental and sales revenues are primarily affected by the business activity within these industries related to research and development, manufacturing, and communication infrastructure installation and maintenance. Historically, these industries have been cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns, which can have a material adverse impact on the industry’s demand for equipment, including our rental electronic test equipment. In addition, the severity and length of any downturn in an industry may also affect overall access to capital, which could adversely affect our customers and result in excess inventory and impairment charges. During periods of reduced and declining demand for test equipment, we are exposed to additional receivable risk from non-payment and may need to rapidly align our cost structure with prevailing market conditions, which may negatively impact our operating results and cash flows. Seasonality of our electronic test equipment business may impact quarterly results. Generally, rental activity declines in the fourth quarter month of December and the first quarter months of January and February. These months may have lower rental activity due to holiday closures, particularly by larger companies, inclement weather and its impact -24- on various field related communications equipment rentals, and companies’ operational recovery from holiday closures which may impact the start-up of new projects coming online in the first quarter. These seasonal factors historically have impacted quarterly results in each year’s first and fourth quarter, but we are unable to predict how such factors may impact future periods. Our rental test equipment may become obsolete or may no longer be supported by a manufacturer, which could result in an impairment charge. Electronic test equipment is characterized by changing technology and evolving industry standards that may render our existing equipment obsolete through new product introductions, or enhancements, before the end of its anticipated useful life, causing us to incur impairment charges. We must anticipate and keep pace with the introduction of new hardware, software and networking technologies and acquire equipment that will be marketable to our current and prospective customers. Additionally, some manufacturers of our equipment may be acquired or cease to exist, resulting in a future lack of support for equipment purchased from those manufacturers. This could result in the remaining useful life becoming shorter, causing us to incur an impairment charge. We monitor our manufacturers’ capacity to support their products and the introduction of new technologies, and we acquire equipment that will be marketable to our current and prospective customers. However, any prolonged economic downturn could result in unexpected bankruptcies or reduced support from our manufacturers. Failure to properly select, manage and respond to the technological needs of our customers and changes to our products through their technology life cycle may cause certain electronic test equipment to become obsolete, resulting in impairment charges, which may negatively impact operating results and cash flows. If we do not effectively compete in the rental equipment market, our operating results will be materially and adversely affected. The electronic test equipment rental business is characterized by intense competition from several competitors, including Electro Rent Corporation, Continental Resources and TestEquity, some of which may have access to greater financial and other resources than we do. Although no single competitor holds a dominant market share, we face competition from these established entities and new entrants in the market. We believe that we anticipate and keep pace with the introduction of new products and acquire equipment that will be marketable to our current and prospective customers. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including product availability, price, service and reliability. Some of our competitors may offer similar equipment for lease, rental or sale at lower prices and may offer more extensive servicing, or financing options. Failure to adequately forecast the adoption of, and demand for, new or existing products may cause us not to meet our customers’ equipment requirements and may materially and adversely affect our operating results. If we are not able to obtain equipment at favorable rates, there could be a material adverse effect on our operating results and reputation. The majority of our rental equipment portfolio is comprised of general purpose test and measurement instruments purchased from leading manufacturers such as Keysight Technologies, Rhode & Schwarz and Tektronix, a division of Fortive Corporation. We depend on purchasing equipment from these manufacturers and suppliers for use as our rental equipment. If, in the future, we are not able to purchase necessary equipment from one or more of these suppliers on favorable terms, we may not be able to meet our customers’ demands in a timely manner or for a rental rate that generates a profit. If this should occur, we may not be able to secure necessary equipment from an alternative source on acceptable terms and our business and reputation may be materially and adversely affected. If we are not able to anticipate and mitigate the risks associated with operating internationally, there could be a material adverse effect on our operating results. Currently, total foreign country customers and operations account for less than 10% of the Company’s revenues. In recent years some of our customers have expanded their international operations faster than domestic operations, and this trend may continue. Over time, the amount of our international business may increase if we focus on international market opportunities. Operating in foreign countries subjects the Company to additional risks, any of which may adversely impact our future operating results, including: • international political, economic and legal conditions including tariffs and trade barriers; • our ability to comply with customs, anti-corruption, import/export and other trade compliance regulations, together with any unexpected changes in such regulations; • greater difficulty in our ability to recover rental equipment and obtain payment of the related trade receivables; • additional costs to establish and maintain international subsidiaries and related operations; • difficulties in attracting and retaining staff and business partners to operate internationally; • language and cultural barriers; -25- • seasonal reductions in business activities in the countries where our international customers are located; • difficulty with the integration of foreign operations; • longer payment cycles; • currency fluctuations; and • potential adverse tax consequences. Unfavorable currency exchange rates may negatively impact our financial results in U.S. dollar terms. We receive revenues in Canadian dollars from our business activities in Canada. Conducting business in currencies other than U.S. dollars subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. If the currency exchange rates change unfavorably, the value of net receivables we receive in foreign currencies and later convert to U.S. dollars after the unfavorable change would be diminished. This could have a negative impact on our reported operating results. We currently do not engage in hedging strategies to mitigate this risk. SPECIFIC RISKS RELATED TO OUR LIQUID AND SOLID CONTAINMENT TANKS AND BOXES BUSINESS SEGMENT: We may be brought into tort or environmental litigation or held responsible for cleanup of spills if the customer fails to perform, or an accident occurs in the use of our rental products, which could materially adversely affect our business, future operating results or financial position. Our rental tanks and boxes are used by our customers to store non-hazardous and certain hazardous liquids and solids on the customer’s site. Our customers are generally responsible for proper operation of our tank and box rental equipment while on rent and returning a cleaned and undamaged container upon completion of use, but exceptions may be granted and we cannot always assure that these responsibilities are fully met in all cases. Although we require the customer to carry commercial general liability insurance in a minimum amount of $5,000,000, such policies often contain pollution exclusions and other exceptions. Furthermore, we cannot be certain our liability insurance will always be sufficient. In addition, if an accident were to occur involving our rental equipment or a spill of substances were to occur when the tank or box was in transport or on rent with our customer, a claim could be made against us as owner of the rental equipment. In the event of a spill or accident, we may be brought into a lawsuit or enforcement action by either our customer or a third party on numerous potential grounds, including an allegation that an inherent flaw in a tank or box contributed to an accident or that the tank had suffered some undiscovered harm from a previous customer’s prior use. In the event of a spill caused by our customers, we may be held responsible for cleanup under environmental laws and regulations concerning obligations of suppliers of rental products to effect remediation. In addition, applicable environmental laws and regulations may impose liability on us for the conduct of third parties, or for actions that complied with applicable regulations when taken, regardless of negligence or fault. Substantial damage awards have also been made in certain jurisdictions against lessors of industrial equipment based upon claims of personal injury, property damage, and resource damage caused by the use of various products. While we take what we believe are reasonable precautions that our rental equipment is in good and safe condition prior to rental and carry insurance to protect against certain risks of loss or accidents, such liability could adversely impact our profitability. The liquid and solid containment rental industry is highly competitive, and competitive pressures could lead to a decrease in our market share or in rental rates and our ability to rent, or sell, equipment at favorable prices, which could adversely affect our operating results. The liquid and solid containment rental industry is highly competitive. We compete against national, regional and local companies, including United Rentals, Rain For Rent and WillScot Corporation, all of which may be larger than we are, may offer a wider range of products and services and may have greater financial and marketing resources than we have. Some of our competitors also have longer operating histories, lower cost basis of rental equipment and lower cost structures than we have. In addition, certain of our competitors are more geographically diverse than we are and have greater name recognition among customers than we do. As a result, our competitors that have these advantages may be better able to attract customers and provide their products and services at lower rental rates. Some competitors offer different approaches to liquid storage, such as large-volume modular tanks that may have better economics and compete with conventional frac tanks in certain oil and gas field applications. We may in the future encounter increased competition in the markets that we serve from existing competitors or from new market entrants. In July 2020, Willscot Corporation acquired Mobile Mini and in July 2018, United Rentals, Inc. completed the acquisition of BakerCorp. Industry consolidation may create additional competition for customers and provide the combined entity access to greater financial resources than we have. We believe that equipment quality, service levels, rental rates and fleet size are key competitive factors in the liquid and solid containment rental industry. From time to time, we or our competitors may attempt to compete aggressively by lowering rental rates or -26- prices. Competitive pressures could adversely affect our revenues and operating results by decreasing our market share or depressing rental rates. To the extent we lower rental rates or increase our fleet in order to retain or increase market share, our operating margins would be adversely impacted. In addition, we may not be able to match a larger competitor’s price reductions or fleet investment because of its greater financial resources, all of which could adversely impact our operating results through a combination of a decrease in our market share, revenues and operating income. Market risk, commodity price volatility, regulatory changes or interruptions and cyclical downturns in the industries using tanks and boxes may result in periods of low demand for our products resulting in excess inventory, impairment charges and reduction of our operating results and cash flows. Adler Tanks’ revenues are derived from the rental of tanks and boxes to companies involved in oil and gas exploration, extraction and refinement, environmental remediation and wastewater/groundwater treatment, infrastructure and building construction and various industrial services, among others. We expect tank and box rental revenues will primarily be affected by the business activity within these industries. Historically, these industries have been cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns, which have a material adverse impact on the industry’s demand for equipment, including the tanks and boxes rented by us. Lower oil or gas prices may have an adverse effect on our liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes business. Any steep decline in both domestic and international oil and gas prices driven by materially higher supply levels and weak demand could have a significant negative impact on the industry’s demand for equipment, especially if such market conditions continue for an extended period of time. If the price reduction causes customers to limit or stop exploration, extraction or refinement activities, resulting in lower demand and pricing for renting Adler Tank’s products, our financial results could be adversely impacted. Also, a weak U.S. economy may negatively impact infrastructure construction and industrial activity. Any of these factors may result in excess inventory or impairment charges and reduce our operating results and cash flows. Changes in regulatory, or governmental, oversight of hydraulic fracturing could materially adversely affect the demand for our rental products and reduce our operating results and cash flows. We believe that demand related to hydraulic fracturing has impacted the total rental revenues and market size in recent years. Oil and gas exploration and extraction (including use of tanks for hydraulic fracturing to obtain shale oil and shale gas) are subject to numerous local, state and federal regulations. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, oil and gas exploration and production accounted for approximately 6% of Adler Tanks’ rental revenues, and approximately 1% of the Company’s total revenues. The hydraulic fracturing method of extraction has come under scrutiny in several states and by the Federal government due to the potential adverse effects that hydraulic fracturing, and the liquids and chemicals used, may have on water quality and public health. In addition, the disposal of wastewater from the hydraulic fracturing process into injection wells may increase the rate of seismic activity near drill sites and could result in regulatory changes, delays or interruption of future activity. Changes in these regulations could limit, interrupt, or stop exploration and extraction activities, which would negatively impact the demand for our rental products. Finally, it is possible that changes in the technology utilized in hydraulic fracturing could make it less dependent on liquids and therefore lower the related requirements for the use of our rental products, which would reduce our operating results and cash flows. Seasonality of the liquid and solid containment rental industry may impact quarterly results. Rental activity may decline in the fourth quarter month of December and the first quarter months of January and February. These months may have lower rental activity in parts of the country where inclement weather may delay, or suspend, a company’s project. The impact of these delays may be to decrease the number of tanks, or boxes, on rent until companies are able to resume their projects when weather improves. These seasonal factors historically have impacted quarterly results in each year’s first and fourth quarter, but we are unable to predict how such factors may impact future periods. Significant increases in raw material, fuel and labor costs could increase our acquisition and operating costs of rental equipment, which would increase operating costs and decrease profitability. Increases in raw material costs such as steel and labor to manufacture liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes would increase the cost of acquiring new equipment. These price increases could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations if we are not able to recoup these increases through higher rental revenues. In addition, a significant amount of revenues are generated from the transport of rental equipment to and from customers. We own delivery trucks, employ drivers and utilize subcontractors to provide these services. The price of fuel can be unpredictable and beyond our control. During periods of rising fuel and labor costs, and in particular when prices increase rapidly, we may not be able recoup these costs from our customers, which would reduce our profitability. -27- We derive a meaningful amount of our revenue in our liquid and solid containment tank and boxes business from a limited number of customers, the loss of one or more of which could have an adverse effect on our business. Periodically, a meaningful portion of our revenue in our liquid and solid containment tank and boxes business may be generated from a few major customers. Although we have some long-term relationships with our major customers, we cannot be assured that our customers will continue to use our products or services or that they will continue to do so at historical levels. The loss of any meaningful customer, the failure to collect a material receivable from a meaningful customer, any material reduction in orders by a meaningful customer or the cancellation of a meaningful customer order could significantly reduce our revenues and consequently harm our financial condition and our ability to fund our operations. We may not be able to quickly redeploy equipment returning from leases at equivalent prices. Many of our rental transactions are short-term in nature with pricing established on a daily basis. The length of time that a customer needs equipment can often be difficult to determine and can be impacted by a number of factors such as weather, customer funding and project delays. In addition, our equipment is primarily used in the oil and gas, industrial plant services, environmental remediation and infrastructure and building construction industries. Changes in the economic conditions facing any of those industries could result in a significant number of units returning off rent, both for us and our competitors. If the supply of rental equipment available on the market significantly increases due to units coming off rent, demand for and pricing of our rental products could be adversely impacted. We may experience delays in remarketing our off-rent units to new customers and incur cost to move the units to other regions where demand is stronger. Actions in these circumstances by our competitors may also depress the market price for rental units. These delays and price pressures would adversely affect equipment utilization levels and total revenues, which would reduce our profitability. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company’s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth in this section as well as those discussed under Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this document. This discussion should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes thereto set forth in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Results of Operations General The Company, incorporated in 1979, is a leading rental provider of relocatable modular buildings for classroom and office space, electronic test equipment for general purpose and communications needs, and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes. The Company’s primary emphasis is on equipment rentals. The Company is comprised of four reportable business segments: (1) its modular building and portable storage container rental segment (“Mobile Modular”); (2) its electronic test equipment rental segment (“TRS-RenTelco”); (3) its containment solutions for the storage of hazardous and non-hazardous liquids and solids segment (“Adler Tanks”); and (4) its classroom manufacturing segment selling modular buildings used primarily as classrooms in California (“Enviroplex”). In 2021, Mobile Modular, TRS-RenTelco, Adler Tanks and Enviroplex contributed 63%, 28%, 5% and 4%, respectively, of the Company’s income before provision for taxes (the equivalent of “pre-tax income”), compared to 62%, 26%, 6% and 6%, respectively, for 2020. The Company generates its revenues primarily from the rental of its equipment on operating leases with sales of equipment occurring in the normal course of business. The Company requires significant capital outlay to purchase its rental inventory and recovers its investment through rental and sales revenues. Rental revenue and certain other service revenues negotiated as part of the lease agreements with customers and related costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the lease. Sales revenue and related costs are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment to the customers. Sales revenues are less predictable and can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer demands and requirements. Generally, rental revenues less cash operating costs recover the equipment’s capitalized cost in a shorter period of time relative to the equipment’s potential rental life and when sold, sale proceeds are usually above its net book value. The Company’s rental operations include rental and rental related services revenues which comprised approximately 79% of the Company’s total revenues in 2021 and for the three years ended December 31, 2021. Over the past three years, modulars, electronic test equipment and tanks and boxes comprised approximately 58%, 24% and 18%, respectively, of the cumulative rental operations revenues. The Company’s direct costs of rental operations include depreciation of rental equipment, rental related service costs, impairment of rental equipment, and other direct costs of rental operations (which include direct labor, supplies, repairs, insurance, property taxes, license fees and amortization of certain lease costs). The Company sells modular, electronic test equipment and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes that are new, or previously rented. The Company’s Enviroplex subsidiary manufactures and sells modular classrooms. The renting and selling of some modular equipment requires a dealer’s license, which the Company has obtained from the appropriate governmental agencies. Sales and other revenues of modulars, electronic test equipment and tanks and boxes have comprised approximately 21% of the Company’s consolidated revenues in 2021 and for the three years ended December 31, 2021. Over the past three years, modulars, electronic test equipment and tanks and boxes comprised approximately 77%, 21% and 2% of sales and other revenues, respectively. The Company’s cost of sales includes the carrying value of the equipment sold and the direct costs associated with the equipment sold such as delivery, installation, modifications and related site work. The rental and sale of modulars to public school districts comprised 21%, 23% and 25% of the Company’s consolidated rental and sales revenues for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. (For more information, see “Item 1. Business – Relocatable Modular Buildings – Classroom Rentals and Sales to Public Schools (K-12)” above.) Selling and administrative expenses primarily include personnel and benefit costs, which includes share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, bad debt expense, advertising costs, and professional service fees. The Company believes that sharing of common facilities, financing, senior management, and operating and accounting systems by all of the Company’s operations, results in an efficient use of overhead. Historically, the Company’s operating margins have been impacted favorably to the extent its costs and expenses are leveraged over a large installed customer base. However, there can be no assurance as to the Company’s ability to maintain a large installed customer base or ability to sustain its historical operating margins. -30- Recent Developments Acquisitions On December 31, 2021 the Company completed the purchase of the assets of Titan Storage Containers, LLC (“Titan”) for $6.9 million cash consideration. Titan is a regional provider of portable storage solutions in the Texas market. The acquisition added approximately 1,150 portable storage containers to the existing Mobile Modular division fleet located in the Texas region. Titan became part of the Mobile Modular reporting segment. On May 17, 2021, the Company completed the purchase of the assets of Design Space Modular Buildings PNW, LP (“Design Space”) for $267.3 million cash consideration on the closing date. Design Space provides modular buildings and portable storage containers rental and sale solutions to customers in the West and Pacific Northwest states in the U.S. Design Space became part of the Mobile Modular reporting segment. On April 1, 2021 the Company completed the purchase of the assets of GRS Holding LLC, DBA Kitchens to Go (“Kitchens To Go”) for $18.3 million cash consideration. Kitchens To Go provides interim and permanent modular kitchen solutions for foodservice providers that require flexible facilities to continue or expand operations. Kitchens To Go became part of the Mobile Modular division, providing temporary foodservice facilities nationwide. Dividends In February 2022, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.455 per common share for the quarter ending March 31, 2022, an increase of 5% over the prior year’s comparable quarter. Note Purchase Agreement In June 2021, the Company issued and sold to Prudential Retirement Insurance and Annuity Company, The Prudential Insurance Company of America and The Prudential Insurance Company of America (collectively, the “Purchasers”) $60 million aggregate principal amount of 2.35% Series E Notes (the ""Series E Notes"") pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement, dated March 31, 2020 (the “Note Purchase Agreement”), among the Company, PGIM, Inc. and the noteholders party thereto. The Series E Notes are an unsecured obligation of the Company. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 2.35% per annum and mature on June 16, 2026. Interest on the Series E Notes is payable semi-annually beginning on December 16, 2021 and continuing thereafter on June 16 and December 16 of each year until maturity. The Company may at any time prepay all or any portion of the Series D Notes; provided that such portion is at least $5,000,000 (and increments of $100,000 in excess thereof). In the event of a prepayment, the Company will pay an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount so prepaid, plus a make-whole amount. The full net proceeds from the Series E Notes was used to pay down the Company’s Credit Facility. In March 2021, the Company issued and sold to Prudential Retirement Insurance and Annuity Company, The Prudential Insurance Company of America and The Prudential Insurance Company of America (collectively, the “Purchasers”) $40 million aggregate principal amount of 2.57% Series D Notes (the ""Series D Notes"") pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement, dated March 31, 2020 (the “Note Purchase Agreement”), among the Company, PGIM, Inc. and the noteholders party thereto. The Series D Notes are an unsecured obligation of the Company. The Notes bear interest at a rate of 2.57% per annum and mature on March 17, 2028. Interest on the Series D Notes is payable semi-annually beginning on September 17, 2021 and continuing thereafter on March 17 and September 17 of each year until maturity. The Company may at any time prepay all or any portion of the Series D Notes; provided that such portion is at least $5,000,000 (and increments of $100,000 in excess thereof). In the event of a prepayment, the Company will pay an amount equal to 100% of the principal amount so prepaid, plus a make-whole amount. The full net proceeds from the Series D Notes was used to pay off the Company’s $40 million Series B Senior Notes. COVID-19 The outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, which began in December 2019, has continued to spread globally including to every state in the United States. The Center for Disease Control (“CDC”) and World Health Organization (“WHO”) recognized this outbreak as a pandemic, which has caused shutdowns to businesses and cities worldwide while disrupting supply chains, business operations, travel, consumer confidence and business sentiment. Each of the states in which the Company operates, and in some cases the localities as well, have previously issued orders requiring the closure of non-essential business and/or requiring residents to stay at home, however, currently none of the Company’s locations are required to be closed by local or state order. The Company is following guidelines established by the CDC and WHO and orders issued by state and local governments where the Company operates. The Company has taken a number of precautionary health and safety measures to safeguard its employees and customers, while maintaining business continuity to enable each of its operating segments and branch locations to continue providing services to customers identified as essential businesses under the relevant state and local rules. The Company has implemented remote work policies, restricted travel, separated work groups, enhanced cleaning and hygiene protocols in all of its facilities, products and vehicles, and requires distancing protocols for production and logistical personnel. The Company is continuing to monitor and assess orders -31- issued by federal, state and local governments to ensure compliance with evolving COVID-19 guidelines. The Company also continues to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on its existing customers who themselves may be impacted by governmental shutdowns and other impacts due to the governmental orders . As of the date of this filing, significant uncertainty continues to exist concerning the magnitude of the impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. While the Company's operating segments and branch locations currently continue to operate, the Company’s results of operations may be negatively impacted by project delays; early returns of equipment currently on rent with customers; overall decreased customer demand for new rental orders, rental related services and sales of new and used rental equipment; and payment delay, or non-payment, by customers who are significantly impacted by COVID-19 . In light of the uncertain and rapidly evolving situation relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has taken a number of precautionary measures to manage its resources conservatively by reducing and/or deferring non-essential capital expenditures and operating expenses to mitigate the adverse impact of the pandemic. The Company will continue to assess its capital expenditure needs against its cash availability during the crisis to make the most strategic decisions for its business. Furthermore, the Company believes that its existing $420 million credit facility, coupled with its ability to access additional capital through the issuance of additional senior notes, would strengthen the Company’s liquidity position and serve to mitigate the operational risk related to potential decreased customer demand for new rental orders and sales resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. While the Company has not seen a significant impact from COVID-19 in the financial results for the year ended December 31, 2021 as set forth in the below section discussing the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company is currently unable to determine or predict the full nature, duration or scope of the overall impact the COVID-19 pandemic will have on its business, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. The Company will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter its business operations as may be required by federal, state or local authorities or that the Company determines are in the best interests of employees, customers and shareholders. Percentage of Revenue Table The following table sets forth for the periods indicated the results of operations as a percentage of the Company’s total revenues and the percentage of changes in the amount of such of items as compared to the amount in the indicated prior period: Percent of Total Revenues Percent Change Three Years Year Ended December 31, 2021 over 2020 over 2021–2019 2021 2020 2019 2020 2019 Revenues Rental 62 % 63 % 61 % 62 % 11 % (1 )% Rental related services 17 16 17 18 6 (9 ) Rental operations 79 79 78 80 10 (2 ) Sales 20 20 22 19 1 13 Other 1 1 — 1 (6 ) (26 ) Total revenues 100 100 100 100 8 0 Costs and expenses Direct costs of rental operations Depreciation of rental equipment 15 15 15 14 7 7 Rental related services 12 12 12 13 9 (11 ) Other 14 15 13 14 23 (7 ) Total direct costs of rental operations 41 42 40 41 13 (3 ) Cost of sales 13 13 14 12 (3 ) 19 Total costs 54 55 54 53 9 2 Gross profit 46 45 46 47 7 (1 ) Selling and administrative expenses 22 24 21 22 21 (1 ) Income from operations 24 21 25 25 (6 ) 0 Other income (expense): Interest expense 2 2 2 2 19 (29 ) Foreign currency exchange gain (loss) — — — — nm nm Income before provision for income taxes 22 20 23 23 (8 ) 2 Provision for income taxes 5 5 5 6 7 (7 ) Net income 16 % 15 % 18 % 17 % -12 % 5 % nm = not meaningful -32- Twelve Months Ended December 31, 202 1 Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2020 Overview Consolidated revenues in 2021 increased to $616.8 million from $572.6 million in 2020. Consolidated net income in 2021 decreased to $89.7 million, or $3.66 per diluted share in 2021, compared to $102.0 million, or $4.16 per diluted share, in 2020. The Company’s year over year total revenue increase was primarily due to higher rental and rental related services revenues as more fully described below. For 2021 compared to 2020, on a consolidated basis: • Gross profit increased $17.3 million, or 7%, to $281.0 million. Mobile Modular’s gross profit increased $20.2 million, or 13%, due to higher gross profit on rental, rental related services and sales revenues. TRS-RenTelco’s gross profit increased $0.5 million, or 1%, primarily due to higher gross profit on rental revenues. Adler Tanks’ gross profit decreased $0.4 million, or 1%, due to lower gross profit on rental and rental related services revenues. Enviroplex’s gross profit decreased $3.0 million, or 24%, primarily due to $1.7 million lower sales revenues and lower gross margins of 31.8% compared to 39.5% in 2020. • Selling and administrative expenses increased $25.6 million, or 21%, to $148.6 million, primarily due to increased headcount and employees’ salaries and benefit costs totaling $12.7 million, primarily from the addition of Design Space and Kitchens To Go employees, and $5.8 million higher amortization of intangible assets from the Design Space and Kitchens To Go acquisitions and $2.0 million of acquisition related transaction costs in 2021. • Interest expense increased $1.7 million, or 19%, due to 38% higher average debt levels of the Company, partly offset by 14% lower net average interest rates of 2.81% in 2021 compared to 3.25% in 2020. • Pre-tax income contribution was 63%, 28% and 5% by Mobile Modular, TRS-RenTelco and Adler Tanks, respectively, in 2021, compared to 62%, 26% and 6%, respectively, in 2020. These results are discussed on a segment basis below. Pre-tax income contribution by Enviroplex was 4% and 6% in 2021 and 2020, respectively. • The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 26.3% and 22.8% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The higher rate in 2021 was primarily due to increased business activity levels in higher tax rate states. • Adjusted EBITDA increased $5.5 million, or 2%, to $246.6 million in 2021. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash impairment costs and share-based compensation. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net cash provided by operating activities and net income to Adjusted EBITDA can be found on page 47. -33- Mobile Modular For 2021, Mobile Modular’s total revenues increased $41.8 million, or 13%, to $363.3 million compared to 2020, primarily due to higher rental, rental related services and sales revenues. The $24.1 million higher selling and administrative expenses, partly offset by the revenue increase, together with higher gross profit on rental, rental related services and sales revenues, resulted in a decrease in pre-tax income of $5.3 million, or 6%, to $77.0 million in 2021.

For the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020: • Gross Profit on Rental Revenues – Rental revenues increased $32.0 million, or 17%, due to 11% higher average rental equipment on rent and 6% higher average monthly rental rates. The rental revenue increase was in part due to the new Design Space and Kitchens To Go customers that contributed approximately three quarters of the increase. As a percentage of rental revenues, depreciation was 13% and 12% in 2021 and 2020, respectively, and other direct costs were 27% in 2021 and 25% in 2020, which resulted in gross margin percentage of 60% in 2021 compared to 63% and 2020. The higher rental revenues and lower rental margins resulted in gross profit on rental revenues increasing $14.1 million, or 12%, to $132.1 million in 2021. • Gross Profit on Rental Related Services – Rental related services revenues increased $4.8 million, or 7%, compared to 2020. Most of these service revenues are negotiated with the initial lease and are recognized on a straight-line basis with the associated costs over the initial term of the lease. The increase in rental related services revenues was primarily attributable to higher amortization of modular building delivery and return delivery and dismantle revenues and increased delivery and return delivery revenues at Portable Storage. The higher revenues offset by lower gross margin percentage of 27% in 2021 compared to 28% in 2020 resulted in rental related services gross profit increasing $0.7 million, or 4%, to $19.3 million in 2021. • Gross Profit on Sales – Sales revenues increased $5.1 million, or 8%, primarily due to higher used equipment sales. The higher sales revenues and higher gross margins of 34% in 2021 compared to 28% in 2020, resulted in sales gross profit increasing $5.4 million, or 30%, to $23.2 million in 2021. Sales occur routinely as a normal part of Mobile Modular’s rental business; however, these sales can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer requirements, equipment availability and funding. For 2021, Mobile Modular’s selling and administrative expenses increased $24.1 million, or 35%, to $92.6 million, primarily due to increased employee salaries and benefit costs totaling $7.4 million, primarily due to the addition of Design Space and Kitchens To Go employees, $5.8 million higher amortization of intangible assets due to the Design Space and Kitchens To Go acquisitions, $4.3 million higher allocated corporate expenses and $2.0 million acquisition related costs in 2021. -35- TRS-RenTelco For 2021, TRS-RenTelco’s total revenues decreased $0.6 million to $140.2 million compared to 2020, primarily due to lower sales revenues, partly offset by higher rental revenues.

For the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019: • Gross Profit on Rental Revenues – Rental revenues increased $6.4 million, or 4%, due to 1% higher average rental equipment on rent and 2% higher average monthly rental rates. As a percentage of rental revenues, depreciation was 12% in 2020 and 2019 and other direct costs were 25% in 2020 and 28% in 2019, which resulted in gross margin percentage of 63% in 2020 compared to 60% and 2019. The higher rental revenues and higher rental margins resulted in gross profit on rental revenues increasing $8.9 million, or 8%, to $118.0 million in 2020. • Gross Profit on Rental Related Services – Rental related services revenues decreased $1.9 million, or 3%, compared to 2019. Most of these service revenues are negotiated with the initial lease and are recognized on a straight-line basis with the associated costs over the initial term of the lease. The decrease in rental related services revenues was primarily attributable to lower amortization of modular building delivery and return delivery and dismantle revenues and lower repair revenues, partly offset by increased site related services revenues. The lower revenues offset by higher gross margin percentage of 28% in 2020 compared to 25% in 2019 resulted in rental related services gross profit increasing $1.0 million, or 6%, to $18.6 million in 2020. • Gross Profit on Sales – Sales revenues increased $16.8 million, or 36%, primarily due to higher new and used equipment sales. The higher sales revenues, partly offset by lower gross margins of 28% in 2020 compared to 31% in 2019, resulted in sales gross profit increasing $3.2 million, or 22%, to $17.9 million in 2020. Sales occur routinely as a normal part of Mobile Modular’s rental business; however, these sales can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer requirements, equipment availability and funding. For 2020, Mobile Modular’s selling and administrative expenses increased $2.8 million, or 4%, to $68.5 million, primarily due to higher allocated corporate expenses and increased salaries and benefit costs, partly offset by lower travel, meals and meeting costs. -42- TRS-RenTelco For 2020, TRS-RenTelco’s total revenues increased $9.3 million, or 7%, to $140.8 million compared to 2019, primarily due to higher rental and sales revenues. Pre-tax income increased $0.3 million, or 1%, to $34.5 million for 2020, primarily due to higher gross profit on sales and rental related services revenues and lower selling and administrative expenses. The following table summarizes year-to-year results for each revenue and gross profit category, income from operations, pre-tax income, and other selected information.

For the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019: • Gross Profit on Rental Revenues – Rental revenues increased $5.4 million, or 5%, to $109.1 million with depreciation expense increasing $4.5 million, or 11%, and other direct costs increasing $0.8 million, or 5%, resulting in a comparable gross profit on rental revenues of $45.5 million in 2020 and 2019. As a percentage of rental revenues, depreciation was 43% in 2020 and 40% in 2019 and other direct costs was 16% in 2020 and 2019, which resulted in gross margin percentage of 42% in 2020 compared to 44% in 2019. The rental revenues increase was due to 10% higher average rental equipment on rent, partly offset by 4% lower average monthly rental rates. • Gross Profit on Sales – Sales revenues increased $4.5 million, or 20%, to $26.6 million in 2020. Gross profit on sales increased $0.3 million with gross margin percentage decreasing to 48% from 56% in 2019, primarily due to lower gross margins on used equipment sales. Sales occur routinely as a normal part of TRS-RenTelco’s rental business; however, these sales and related gross margins can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer requirements, equipment availability and funding. For 2020, TRS-RenTelco’s selling and administrative expenses decreased $0.3 million, or 1%, to $24.3 million, primarily due to lower salaries and benefit costs and lower travel, meals and meeting expenses, partly offset by higher allocated corporate expenses. -44- Adler Tanks For 2020, Adler Tanks’ total revenues decreased $20.4 million, or 21%, to $77.5 million compared to 2019, primarily due to lower rental and rental related services revenues. Pre-tax income decreased $7.0 million, primarily due to lower gross profit on rental, rental related services and sales, partly offset by lower selling and administrative expenses. The following table summarizes year-to-year results for each revenue and gross profit category, income from operations, pre-tax income and other selected information.

For the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019: • Gross Profit on Rental Revenues – Rental revenues decreased $13.9 million, or 20%, to $54.0 million, due to 18% lower average rental equipment on rent and 2% lower average monthly rental rates in 2020 as compared to 2019. The rental revenue decrease was primarily due to COVID-19 related business disruptions and a decrease in the price of oil and gas, which contributed to weaker activities in multiple geographic and market segments. As a percentage of rental revenues, depreciation was 30% and 24% in 2020 and 2019, respectively, and other direct costs were 17% and 18% in 2020 and 2019, respectively, which resulted in gross margin percentages of 53% in 2020 compared to 58% in 2019. The lower rental revenues, together with lower rental margins resulted in gross profit on rental revenues decreasing $10.9 million, or 28%, to $28.6 million in 2020. • Gross Profit on Rental Related Services – Rental related services revenues decreased $6.6 million, or 23%, compared to 2019. The lower revenues together with lower gross margin percentage of 23% in 2020 compared to 24% in 2019 resulted in rental related services gross profit decreasing $1.7 million, or 25%, to $5.0 million in 2020. For 2020, Adler Tanks’ selling and administrative expenses decreased $4.6 million, or 16%, to $24.8 million, primarily due to lower salaries and employee benefit costs, travel, meals and meeting expenses and lower corporate allocated expenses. -46- Adjusted EBITDA To supplement the Company’s financial data presented on a basis consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), the Company presents “Adjusted EBITDA”, which is defined by the Company as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash impairment costs and share-based compensation. The Company presents Adjusted EBITDA as a financial measure as management believes it provides useful information to investors regarding the Company’s liquidity and financial condition and because management, as well as the Company’s lenders, use this measure in evaluating the performance of the Company. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a supplement to GAAP measures to further evaluate period-to-period operating performance, compliance with financial covenants in the Company’s revolving lines of credit and senior notes and the Company’s ability to meet future capital expenditure and working capital requirements. Management believes the exclusion of non-cash charges, including share-based compensation, is useful in measuring the Company’s cash available for operations and performance of the Company. Because management finds Adjusted EBITDA useful, the Company believes its investors will also find Adjusted EBITDA useful in evaluating the Company’s performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, cash flows, or other consolidated income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of the Company’s profitability or liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA is not in accordance with or an alternative for GAAP and may be different from non−GAAP measures used by other companies. Unlike EBITDA, which may be used by other companies or investors, Adjusted EBITDA does not include share-based compensation charges. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is of limited use in that it does not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and does not accurately reflect real cash flow. In addition, other companies may not use Adjusted EBITDA or may use other non-GAAP measures, limiting the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA for purposes of comparison. The Company’s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that the Company will not incur expenses that are the same as or similar to the adjustments in this presentation. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA should only be used to evaluate the Company’s results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. The Company compensates for the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA by relying upon GAAP results to gain a complete picture of the Company’s performance. Because Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure, as defined by the SEC, the Company includes in the tables below reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.

Adjusted EBITDA is a component of two restrictive financial covenants for the Company’s unsecured Credit Facility, the Note Purchase Agreement, Series C Senior Notes, Series D Senior Notes and Series E Senior Notes (as defined and more fully described under the heading “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources”). These instruments contain financial covenants requiring the Company to not: • Permit the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility and the Note Purchase Agreement (as defined and more fully described under the heading “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Liquidity and Capital Resources” in this MD&A)) of Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility and the Note Purchase Agreement) to fixed charges as of the end of any fiscal quarter to be less than 2.50 to 1. At December 31, 2021, the actual ratio was 4.08 to 1. • Permit the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of funded debt (as defined in the Credit Facility and the Note Purchase Agreement) to Adjusted EBITDA at any time during any period of four consecutive quarters to be greater than 2.75 to 1. At December 31, 2021, the actual ratio was 1.73 to 1. At December 31, 2021, the Company was in compliance with each of these aforementioned covenants. There are no anticipated trends that the Company is aware of that would indicate non-compliance with these covenants, though, significant deterioration in our financial performance could impact the Company's ability to comply with these covenants. -48- Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company’s rental businesses are capital intensive and generate significant cash flows. Cash flows for the Company in 2021 as compared to 2020 are summarized as follows: Cash Flows from Operating Activities: The Company’s operations provided net cash flow of $195.7 million for 2021 as compared to $180.5 million in 2020. The 8% increase was primarily attributable to increased deferred income and deferred income taxes, a higher increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and other balance sheet changes. Cash Flows from Investing Activities: Net cash used in investing activities was $351.7 million for 2021 as compared to $53.0 million in 2020. The $298.7 million increase was primarily due to $27.8 million higher purchases of rental equipment of $114.1 million in 2021, compared to 2020, and $292.2 million cash paid for acquisition of businesses, partly offset by $11.0 million lower purchases of property, plant and equipment and $10.3 million higher proceeds from sales of used rental equipment. Cash Flows from Financing Activities: Net cash provided by financing activities was $156.2 million in 2021 as compared to $128.5 million net cash used in 2020. The $284.7 million increase was primarily due to $214.4 million higher net borrowings under bank lines of credit to fund the Design Space and Kitchens To Go acquisitions, $60.0 million higher net borrowings under note purchase agreements, and partly offset by $13.6 million lower repurchase of common stock in 2021. Significant capital expenditures are required to maintain and grow the Company’s rental assets. During the last three years, the Company has financed its working capital and capital expenditure requirements through cash flows from operations, proceeds from the sale of rental equipment and from borrowings. Sales occur routinely as a normal part of the Company’s rental businesses. However, these sales can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer requirements and funding. Although the net proceeds received from sales may fluctuate from period to period, the Company believes its liquidity will not be adversely impacted from lower sales in any given year because it believes it has the ability to increase its bank borrowings, offer additional notes and conserve its cash in the future by reducing the amount of cash it uses to purchase rental equipment, pay dividends, or repurchase the Company’s common stock. As the following table indicates, cash flow provided by operating activities and proceeds from sales of used rental equipment have been greater than rental equipment purchases over the past three years. Funding of Rental Asset Growth (amounts in thousands) Year Ended December 31, Three Year 2021 2020 2019 Totals Cash provided by operating activities $ 195,743 $ 180,504 $ 187,994 $ 564,241 Proceeds from sales of used rental equipment 57,337 47,052 44,447 148,836 Cash available for purchase of rental equipment 253,080 227,556 232,441 713,077 Purchases of rental equipment (114,145 ) (86,329 ) (167,703 ) (368,177 ) Cash available for other purposes $ 138,935 $ 141,227 $ 64,738 $ 344,900 In addition to increasing its rental assets, the Company has made acquisitions of businesses and business assets totaling $292.2 million in 2021 and $7.8 million in 2019. The Company had other capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment of $2.7 million in 2021, $13.7 million in 2020 and $12.1 million in 2019, and has used cash to provide returns to its shareholders in the form of cash dividends. The Company paid cash dividends of $42.2 million, $39.8 million and $35.5 million in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company has in the past made purchases of shares of its common stock from time to time in over-the-counter market (NASDAQ) transactions, through privately negotiated, large block transactions and through a share repurchase plan, in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In August 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase 2,000,000 shares of the Company's outstanding common stock (the “Repurchase Plan”). The amount and time of the specific repurchases are subject to prevailing market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors, including management’s discretion. All shares repurchased by the Company are canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares of common stock. There can be no assurance that any authorized shares will be repurchased and the repurchase program may be modified, extended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. There were no shares of common stock repurchased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. There were 282,221 shares of common stock repurchased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, for the aggregate purchase price of $13.6 million or an average price of $48.25 per repurchased share. As of December 31, 2021, 1,309,805 shares remain authorized for repurchase under the Repurchase Plan. -49- Unsecured Revolving Lines of Credit On March 31, 2020, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender, L/C Issuer and lender, and other lenders named therein (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility provides for a $420.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (which may be further increased to $670.0 million by adding one or more tranches of term loans and/or increasing the aggregate revolving commitments), which includes a $25.0 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a $10.0 million sublimit for swingline loans. The proceeds of the Credit Facility are available to be used for general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions. The Credit Facility permits the Company’s existing indebtedness to remain, which includes the Company’s $12.0 million Treasury Sweep Note due March 31, 2025, the Company’s existing senior notes issued pursuant to the Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement with Prudential Investment Management, Inc., dated as of April 21, 2011 (as amended, the “the Prior NPA”): (i) the $40.0 million aggregate outstanding principal of notes issued March 17, 2014 which were repaid on March 17, 2021, and (ii) the $60.0 million aggregate outstanding principal of notes issued November 5, 2015 and due November 5, 2022. In addition, the Company may incur additional senior note indebtedness in an aggregate amount not to exceed $250.0 million. The Credit Facility matures on March 31, 2025 and replaced the Company’s prior $420.0 million credit facility dated March 31, 2016 with Bank of America, N.A., as agent, as amended. All obligations outstanding under the prior credit facility as of the date of the Credit Facility were refinanced by the Credit Facility on March 31, 2020. On March 30, 2020, the Company entered into an amended and restated Credit Facility Letter Agreement and a Credit Line Note in favor of MUFG Union Bank, N.A., which provides for a $12.0 million line of credit facility related to its cash management services (“Sweep Service Facility”). The Sweep Service Facility matures on the earlier of March 31, 2025, or the date the Company ceases to utilize MUFG Union Bank, N.A. for its cash management services. The Sweep Service Facility replaced the Company’s prior $12.0 million sweep service facility, dated as of March 31, 2016. At December 31, 2021, under the Credit Facility and Sweep Service Facility, the Company had unsecured lines of credit that permit it to borrow up to $432.0 million of which $266.5 million was outstanding. The Credit Facility contains financial covenants requiring the Company to not (all defined terms used below not otherwise defined herein have the meaning assigned to such terms in the Amended Credit Facility): • Permit the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges as of the end of any fiscal quarter to be less than 2.50 to 1. At December 31, 2021, the actual ratio was 4.08 to 1. • Permit the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of funded debt to EBITDA at any time during any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters to be greater than 2.75 to 1. At December 31, 2021, the actual ratio was 1.73 to 1. At December 31, 2021, the Company was in compliance with each of the aforementioned covenants. There are no anticipated trends that the Company is aware of that would indicate non-compliance with these covenants, although significant deterioration in our financial performance could impact the Company’s ability to comply with these covenants. Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement On March 31, 2020, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement (the “Note Purchase Agreement”) with PGIM, Inc. (“PGIM”) and the holders of Series B and Series C Notes previously issued pursuant to the Prior NPA, among the Company and the other parties to the Note Purchase Agreement. The Note Purchase Agreement amended and restated, and superseded in its entirety, the Prior NPA. Pursuant to the Prior NPA, the Company issued (i) $40.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.68% Series B Senior Notes, which were repaid on March 17, 2021, and (ii) $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.84% Series C Senior Notes due November 5, 2022, to which the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement shall apply. In addition, pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, the Company may authorize the issuance and sale of additional senior notes (the “Shelf Notes”) in the aggregate principal amount of (x) $250 million minus (y) the amount of other notes (such as the Series B Senior Notes and Series C Senior Notes, each defined below) then outstanding, to be dated the date of issuance thereof, to mature, in case of each Shelf Note so issued, no more than 15 years after the date of original issuance thereof, to have an average life, in the case of each Shelf Note so issued, of no more than 15 years after the date of original issuance thereof, to bear interest on the unpaid balance thereof from the date thereof at the rate per annum, and to have such other particular terms, as shall be set forth, in the case of each Shelf Note so issued, in accordance with the Note Purchase Agreement. Shelf Notes may be issued and sold from time to time at the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors and in such amounts as the Board of Directors may determine, subject to prospective purchasers’ agreement to purchase the Shelf Notes. The Company will sell the Shelf Notes directly to such purchasers. The full net proceeds of each Shelf Note will be used in the manner described in the applicable Request for Purchase with respect to such Shelf Note. -50- 3.84% Senior Notes Due in 2022 In November 2015, the Company issued and sold to the purchasers a $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.84% Series C Senior Notes (the “Series C Senior Notes”) pursuant to the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement, as amended. The Series C Senior Notes are an unsecured obligation of the Company and bear interest at a rate of 3.84% per annum and mature on November 5, 2022. Interest on the Series C Senior Notes is payable semi-annually beginning on May 5, 2016 and continuing thereafter on November 5 and May 5 of each year until maturity. The principal balance is due when the notes mature in 2022. The full net proceeds from the Series C Senior Notes were used to reduce the outstanding balance on the Company’s revolving credit line. At December 31, 2021, the principal balance outstanding under the Series C Senior Notes was $60.0 million. 2.57% Senior Notes Due in 2028 On March 17, 2021, the Company issued and sold to the purchasers $40 million aggregate principal amount of 2.57% Series D Notes (the “Series D Senior Notes”) pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement, dated March 31, 2020 (the “Note Purchase Agreement”), among the Company, PGIM, Inc. and the noteholders party thereto. The Series D Senior Notes are an unsecured obligation of the Company and bear interest at a rate of 2.57% per annum and mature on March 17, 2028. Interest on the Series D Senior Notes is payable semi-annually beginning on September 17, 2021 and continuing thereafter on March 17 and September 17 of each year until maturity. The principal balance is due when the notes mature on March 17, 2028. The full net proceeds from the Series D Senior Notes were used to pay off the Company’s $40 million Series B Senior Notes. At December 31, 2021, the principal balance outstanding under the Series D Senior Notes was $40.0 million. 2.35% Senior Notes Due in 2026 On June 16, 2021, the Company issued and sold to the purchasers $60 million aggregate principal amount of 2.35% Series E Notes (the ""Series E Notes"") pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement, dated March 31, 2020 (the “Note Purchase Agreement”), among the Company, PGIM, Inc. and the noteholders party thereto. The Series E Senior Notes are an unsecured obligation of the Company and bear interest at a rate of 2.35% per annum and mature on June 16, 2026. Interest on the Series E Senior Notes is payable semi-annually beginning on December 16, 2021 and continuing thereafter on June 16 and December 16 of each year until maturity. The principal balance is due when the notes mature on June 16, 2026. The full net proceeds from the Series E Senior Notes were used to pay down the Company’s credit facility. At December 31, 2021, the principal balance outstanding under the Series E Senior Notes was $60.0 million. Among other restrictions, the Note Purchase Agreement, which has superseded in its entirety the Prior NPA, under which the Series C Senior Notes, Series D Senior Notes and Series E Senior Notes were sold, contains financial covenants requiring the Company to not (all defined terms used below not otherwise defined herein have the meaning assigned to such terms in the Note Purchase Agreement): • Permit the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of EBITDA (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) to fixed charges as of the end of any fiscal quarter to be less than 2.50 to 1. At December 31, 2021, the actual ratio was 4.08 to 1. • Permit the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of funded debt to EBITDA (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) at any time during any period of four consecutive quarters to be greater than 2.75 to 1. At December 31, 2021, the actual ratio was 1.73 to 1. At December 31, 2021, the Company was in compliance with each of the aforementioned covenants. There are no anticipated trends that the Company is aware of that would indicate non-compliance with these covenants, although significant deterioration in our financial performance could impact the Company’s ability to comply with these covenants. Although no assurance can be given, the Company believes it will continue to be able to negotiate general bank lines of credit and issue senior notes adequate to meet capital requirements not otherwise met by operational cash flows and proceeds from sales of rental equipment. Furthermore, the Company believes it has the financial resources to weather any short term impacts of COVID-19. However, the Company has limited insight into the extent to which its business may be impacted by COVID-19, and there are many u ncertainties, including how long and how severely the Company will be impacted. An extended and severe impact may materially and adversely affect the Company’s future operations, financial position and liquidity. Contractual Obligations and Commitments At December 31, 2021, the Company’s material contractual obligations and commitments consisted of outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities expiring in 2025, outstanding amounts under our 3.84%, 2.35% and 2.57% senior notes due in 2022, 2026 and 2028, respectively, and operating leases for facilities. The operating lease amounts exclude property taxes and insurance. The table -51- below provides a summary of the Company’s contractual obligations and reflects expected payments due as of December 31, 20 2 1 and does not reflect changes that could arise after that date.

Please see the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows on page 64 for a more detailed presentation of the sources and uses of the Company's cash. Critical Accounting Policies The Company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. A summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies are in Note 1 to the Company’s consolidated financial statements. The Company determined its critical accounting policies by considering those policies that involve the most complex or subjective assumptions, estimates, and/or judgement. Material changes in these assumptions, estimates or judgments could have the potential to have a material impact on the Company’s financial results. The Company has identified below the accounting policies that it believes could potentially have a material impact on operating results if a change in assumption, estimate and/or judgment were to occur. Depreciation - The estimated useful lives and estimated residual values used for rental equipment are based on the Company’s experience as to the economic useful life and sale value of its products. Additionally, to the extent information is publicly available, the Company also compares its depreciation policies to other companies with similar rental products for reasonableness. The lives and residual values of rental equipment are subject to periodic evaluation. For modular equipment, external factors to consider may include, but are not limited to, changes in legislation, regulations, building codes, local permitting, and supply or demand. Internal factors for modulars may include, but are not limited to, change in equipment specifications, condition of equipment, or maintenance policies. For electronic test equipment, external factors to consider may include, but are not limited to, technological advances, changes in manufacturers’ selling prices, and supply or demand. Internal factors for electronic test equipment may include, but are not limited to, change in equipment specifications, condition of equipment, or maintenance policies. For liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes, external factors to consider may include, but are not limited to, changes in Federal and State legislation, the types of materials stored and the frequency of movements and uses. Internal factors for liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes may include, but are not limited to, change in equipment specifications and maintenance policies. To the extent that the useful lives of all of our rental equipment were to decrease or increase by one year, the Company estimates the annual depreciation expense would increase or decrease by approximately $6 million. If the estimated residual values of all of our rental equipment were to change one percentage point, the Company estimates the annual depreciation expense would change by approximately $1 million. Any changes in depreciation expense as a result of a change in useful lives or residual values would result in a proportional increase or decrease in the gross profit the Company would recognize upon the ultimate sale of the equipment. Maintenance, repair and refurbishment - Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The direct material and labor costs of value-added additions or major refurbishment of modular buildings are capitalized to the extent the refurbishment significantly improves the quality and adds value or life to the equipment. Judgment is involved as to when these costs should be capitalized. The Company’s policies narrowly limit the capitalization of value-added items to specific additions such as portable storage office conversions, restrooms, sidewalls and ventilation upgrades. In addition, only major refurbishment costs incurred near the end of the estimated useful life of the rental equipment, which extend its useful life, and are subject to certain limitations, are capitalized. The Company capitalized $6 million in extended life or value added refurbishments in 2021. Changes in these policies to expense these costs as incurred could impact the Company’s financial results. -52- Acquisition Accounting - The Company has made acquisitions of businesses in the past and records the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. Long-lived assets (primarily rental equipment), goodwill and other intangible assets generally represent the largest components of the Company’s acquisitions. Determining the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired can be judgmental in nature and can involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Rental equipment is valued utilizing either a cost, market or income approach, or a combination of certain of these methods, depending on the asset being valued and the availability of market or income data. The intangible assets acquired are primarily comprised of customer relationships, non-compete agreements and trade names. These assets are valued on an excess earnings or income approach based on projected cash flows. The estimated fair values of these intangible assets reflect various assumptions about revenue growth rates, operating margins, projected cash flows, discount rates, customer attrition rates, terminal values, useful lives and other prospective financial information. When appropriate, the Company’s estimates of the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired include assistance from independent third-party valuation firms. Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of the acquired business over the net of the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired, as well as the estimated life of the assets, can materially impact the Company’s financial results in periods subsequent to the acquisition through depreciation and amortization, and in certain instances through impairment charges, if the asset becomes impaired in the future. As discussed below, we regularly review for impairments. Impairment of rental equipment - The carrying value of the Company’s rental equipment is its capitalized cost less accumulated depreciation. To the extent events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value cannot be recovered, an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carrying value to fair value. The Company evaluates the carrying value of rental equipment for impairment whenever events and circumstances have occurred that would indicate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable. Determining fair value includes estimates and judgments regarding the projected net cash flows considering current and future market conditions including assumptions regarding utilization, rental pricing, the condition of the equipment, the equipment’s expected remaining life and sale proceeds. Due to uncertainties inherent in the valuation process and market conditions, it is reasonably possible that actual results of operating and disposing of rental equipment could be materially different than current expectations. Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets - The Company’s goodwill is not amortized to expense, the Company assesses whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to complete quantitative impairment assessments. These impairment assessments occur annually, or more frequently if an event occurs, or circumstances change in the interim that would indicate that it was more likely than not the fair value had reduced below its carrying value. Application of the goodwill impairment assessment requires judgement including the identification of reporting units, assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units, business projections including changes in pricing, rental and sale activity and costs, long term growth rates and discount rates. In 2021, 2020 and 2019 the Company performed qualitative assessments taking into consideration the market value of the Company, any changes in management, key personnel, strategy and any relevant macroeconomic conditions, concluding that the fair value of the reporting units substantially exceeded the respective reporting units carrying value, including goodwill. Intangible assets (other than goodwill) acquired are recorded at their estimated fair value at the date of acquisition. Definite lived intangibles are amortized over their expected useful lives, while indefinite lived intangibles are not amortized. The Company monitors conditions related to these assets to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining amortization period. The Company tests these assets for potential impairment annually and whenever management determines events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Revenue recognition: Lease revenue - Rental revenues from operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease for all operating segments. Rental billings for periods extending beyond period end are recorded as deferred income and are recognized in the period earned. Rental related services revenues are primarily associated with relocatable modular building and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes leases. For modular building leases, rental related services revenues for modifications, delivery, installation, dismantle and return delivery are lease related because the payments are considered minimum lease payments that are an integral part of the negotiated lease agreement with the customer. These revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain leases are accounted for as sales-type leases. For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment. Other revenues include interest income on sales-type leases and rental income on facility leases. Non-lease revenue - Sales revenue is recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment to customers. Certain leases are accounted for as sales-type leases. For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment. The Company typically recognizes non-lease related revenues at a point in time because the customer does not simultaneously consume the benefits of the Company’s promised goods and services, or performance obligations, and obtain control when delivery and installation are complete. For contracts that have multiple performance obligations, the transaction -53- price is allocated to each performance obligation in the contract based on the Company’s best estimate of the standalone selling prices of each distinct performance obligation in the contract. The standalone selling price is typically determined based upon the expected cost plus an estimated margin of each performance obligation. Judgment is involved in determining the performance obligations and standalone selling prices. To the extent actual results were to differ from these estimates, the timing of profit recognition could change and impact the Company’s financial results. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. The Company is exposed to cash flow and fair value risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to its 3.84%, 2.35% and 2.57% senior notes due in 2022, 2026 and 2028, respectively, and its revolving lines of credit. Weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at December 31, 2021. The estimate of fair value of the Company’s fixed rate debt is based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for bank loans with similar terms and average maturities. The table below presents principal cash flows by expected annual maturities, related weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value for the Company’s Series C, Series D and Series E Senior Notes and the Company’s revolving lines of credit under the Credit Facility and Sweep Service Facility as of December 31, 2021.

The Company commenced the closure of its Indian operations during 2017. The Canadian operations of the Company subject it to foreign currency risks (i.e. the possibility that the financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates). Currently, the Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge its economic exposure with respect to assets, liabilities and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In 2021, the Company experienced minimal impact on net income due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Although there can be no assurances, given the size of the Canadian operations, the Company does not expect future foreign exchange gains and losses to be significant. The Company has no derivative financial instruments that expose the Company to significant market risk. -54- ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.

The consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles and include amounts based on management’s estimates and judgments. All other financial information in this report has been presented on a basis consistent with the information included in the financial statements. The Company’s management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company maintains a system of internal control that is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliable preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements, as well as to safeguard assets from unauthorized use or disposition. The Company’s system of internal control over financial reporting is embodied in the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. It sets the tone of our organization and includes factors such as integrity and ethical values. Our internal control over financial reporting is supported by formal policies and procedures, which are reviewed, modified and improved as changes occur in business conditions and operations. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed solely of outside directors, meets periodically with members of management and the independent auditors to review and discuss internal control over financial reporting, as well as accounting and financial reporting matters. The independent auditors report to the Audit Committee and accordingly have full and free access to the Audit Committee at any time. The Company’s management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 based on the criteria set forth in the 2013 Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on its evaluation, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2021, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. -56- Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Board of Directors and Shareholders McGrath RentCorp Opinion on internal control over financial reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of McGrath RentCorp (a California corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by COSO.

Basis for opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.

We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP San Jose, California February 23, 2022 -57- Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Board of Directors and Shareholders McGrath RentCorp Opinion on the financial statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of McGrath RentCorp (a California corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), and our report dated February 23, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion. Basis for opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical audit matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate . Valuation of electronics rental equipment As described further in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company evaluates the carrying value of rental equipment for impairment whenever events and circumstances have occurred that would indicate the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. We identified the valuation of the Company’s TRS-RenTelco rental equipment as a critical audit matter. The principal consideration for our determination of the valuation of the TRS-RenTelco rental equipment as a critical audit matter is that the TRS-RenTelco rental equipment can be sensitive to new developments in technology, which creates the risk that equipment could become obsolete or impaired. Management’s impairment analysis relies on estimates of the future financial performance of its rental equipment. These estimates include assumptions based upon historical and projected results including utilization, rental pricing, and the equipment’s useful life and expected sales proceeds. The failure to achieve these projections might be an indicator of potential impairment. Our audit procedures related to the impairment of TRS-RenTelco rental equipment included the following, among others. • We tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls relating to the impairment process, determination of the assumptions, and review of equipment that didn’t meet determined performance thresholds. -58- • We evaluated the appropriateness of useful lives assigned to the rental equipment. • We analyzed trends in utilization and yield (which is derived by dividing rental revenue by equipment cost) at a disaggregated product level, both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter to evaluate if indicators of impairment were present for any particular product category. • For a sample of assets, we inspected underlying supporting evidence and compared to the information in management’s analysis for accuracy. • We identified underperforming assets by recalculating management’s analysis performed and using actual margins on sales proceeds. For the assets identified, we inquired of management with respect to these assets and factors driving assessment of realizability and corroborated explanations received. Valuation of Customer Relationships Intangible Asset Acquired through Design Space Acquisition As described further in Note 13 to the financial statements, the Company completed the purchase of substantially all of the assets of Design Space Modular Buildings PNW, LP (“Design Space”) for $267.3 million in cash consideration. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase of a “business” in accordance with criteria in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805 – “Business Combinations” using the purchase method of accounting. We identified the valuation of the acquired customer relationships asset as a critical audit matter. The principal considerations for our determination that the Company’s assessment of the fair value of the acquired customer relationships asset represents a critical audit matter is that the judgments and key assumptions made in assessing the fair value of the customer relationship are complex and subjective. The significant assumptions utilized to determine the fair value included projected future cash flows, associated discount rates used to calculate present value, customer attrition rates, and other assumptions that form the basis of the forecasted results. These significant assumptions are forward looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. Our audit procedures related to the valuation of the customer relationships asset from the acquisition of Design Space included the following, among others: • We inspected the purchase agreement and evaluated management’s process for identifying and estimating the fair value of the acquired customer relationships asset. • We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's controls over its valuation of the acquired customer relationships asset, including determination of the underlying assumptions. • We evaluated the Company's selection of the valuation methodology, significant assumptions, and the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions and estimates. We compared management’s assumptions used to develop the discount rates to the weighted average cost of capital of guideline public companies. Additionally, we compared the significant assumptions related to prospective financial information to the historical results of the Design Space business and to guideline companies in the same industry. We also performed a sensitivity analysis of the significant assumptions to evaluate the impact on the concluded fair value that would result from changes in assumptions. • We reviewed the qualifications of the external third-party valuation specialist engaged by management in the fair value determination. /s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Organization McGrath RentCorp and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the “Company”) is a California corporation organized in 1979. The Company is a diversified business to business rental company with four rental divisions; relocatable modular buildings, portable storage containers, electronic test equipment and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes. Although the Company’s primary emphasis is on equipment rentals, sales of equipment occur in the normal course of business. The Company is comprised of four reportable business segments: modular building and portable storage segment (“Mobile Modular”), electronic test equipment segment (“TRS-RenTelco”), containment solutions for the storage of hazardous and non-hazardous liquids and solids segment (“Adler Tanks”) and classroom manufacturing division selling modular classrooms in California (“Enviroplex”). Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of McGrath RentCorp and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Revenue Recognition Lease revenues - Rental revenues from operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease for all operating segments. Rental billings for periods extending beyond period end are recorded as deferred income and are recognized in the period earned. Rental related services revenues are primarily associated with relocatable modular building and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes leases. For modular building leases, rental related services revenues for modifications, delivery, installation, dismantle and return delivery are lease related because the payments are considered minimum lease payments that are an integral part of the negotiated lease agreement with the customer. These revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain leases are accounted for as sales-type leases. For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment. Other revenues include interest income on sales-type leases and rental income on facility leases. Non-lease revenues - Sales revenue is recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment to customers. Certain leases are accounted for as sales-type leases. For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment. Other revenue is recognized when earned and primarily includes interest income on sales-type leases, rental income on facility leases and certain logistics services. Sales taxes charged to customers are reported on a net basis and are excluded from revenues and expenses. Depreciation of Rental Equipment Rental equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis for financial reporting purposes and on an accelerated basis for income tax purposes. The costs of major refurbishment of relocatable modular buildings, portable storage containers and tanks and boxes are capitalized to the extent the refurbishment significantly adds value to, or extends the life of the equipment. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The estimated useful lives and residual values of the Company’s rental equipment used for financial reporting purposes are as follows: Relocatable modular buildings 18 years, 50% residual value Relocatable modular accessories 3 to 18 years, no residual value Blast resistant and kitchen modules 20 years, no residual value Portable storage containers 25 years, 62.5% residual value Electronic test equipment and accessories 1 to 8 years, no residual value Liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes and accessories 3 to 20 years, no residual value -65- Costs of Rental Related Services Costs of rental related services are primarily associated with relocatable modular building leases and liquid and solid containment tank and boxes. Modular building leases primarily consist of costs for services to be provided under the negotiated lease agreement for delivery, installation, modifications, skirting, additional site-related work, and dismantle and return delivery. Costs related to these services are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Costs of rental related services associated with liquid and solid containment solutions consists of costs of delivery, removal and cleaning of the tanks and boxes. These costs are recognized in the period the service is performed. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company evaluates the carrying value of rental equipment and identifiable definite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances have occurred that would indicate the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. A key element in determining the recoverability of long-lived assets is the Company’s outlook as to the future market conditions for its rental equipment. If the carrying amount is not fully recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carrying amount to fair value. The Company determines fair value based upon the condition of the rental equipment and the projected net cash flows from its rental and sale considering current market conditions. Goodwill and identifiable indefinite lived assets are evaluated for potential impairment annually or when circumstances indicate potential impairment may have occurred. Impairment losses, if any, are determined based upon the excess of carrying value over the estimated fair value of the asset. There were no impairments of long-lived assets during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Other Direct Costs of Rental Operations Other direct costs of rental operations include direct labor, supplies, repairs, insurance, property taxes, license fees, impairment of rental equipment and certain modular lease costs charged to customers in the negotiated rental rate, which are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Cost of Sales Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income includes the carrying value of the equipment sold and all direct costs associated with the sale. Warranty Reserves Sales of new relocatable modular buildings, portable storage containers, electronic test equipment and related accessories and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes not manufactured by the Company are typically covered by warranties provided by the manufacturer of the products sold. The Company typically provides limited 90 -day warranties for certain sales of used rental equipment and one-year warranties on equipment manufactured by Enviroplex. Although the Company’s policy is to provide reserves for warranties when required for specific circumstances, the Company has not found it necessary to establish such reserves to date as warranty costs have not been significant. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis for financial reporting purposes, and on an accelerated basis for income tax purposes. Depreciation expense for property, plant and equipment is included in “Selling and administrative expenses” and “Rental related services” in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. -66- Property, plant and equipment consist of the following: (dollar amounts in thousands) Estimated useful life December 31, in years 2021 2020 Land Indefinite $ 54,428 $ 54,429 Land improvements 20 – 50 59,633 59,249 Buildings 30 33,781 32,306 Furniture, office equipment and software 3 – 10 37,965 36,882 Vehicles and machinery 5 – 25 44,560 43,101 230,367 225,967 Less: accumulated depreciation ( 98,333 ) ( 91,514 ) 132,034 134,453 Construction in progress 3,291 1,757 $ 135,325 $ 136,210 Property, plant and equipment depreciation expense was $ 8.9 million, $ 8.6 million and $ 8.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Construction in progress at December 31, 2021 and 2020 consisted primarily of costs related to acquisition of land, land improvements and information technology upgrades. Capitalized Software Costs The Company capitalizes certain development costs incurred in connection with its internal use software. Costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as incurred. Once an application has reached the development stage, direct internal and external costs are capitalized until the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. These costs generally include external direct costs of materials and services consumed in the project and internal costs, such as payroll and benefits of those employees directly associated with the development of the software. Maintenance, training and post implementation costs are expensed as incurred. The Company also capitalizes costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality. Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and equipment. The Company capitalized $ 0.2 million and $ 0.1 million in internal use software during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Total advertising expenses were $ 5.1 million, $ 3.9 million and $ 3.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the effect of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are adjusted to the extent necessary to reflect tax rates expected to be in effect when temporary differences reverse. Adjustments may be required to deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities due to changes in tax laws and audit adjustments by tax authorities. A valuation allowance would be established if, based on the weight of available evidence, management believes that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a recorded deferred tax asset would not be realized in future periods. To the extent adjustments are required in any given period, the adjustments would be included within the “Provision for income taxes” in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Purchase prices of acquired businesses are allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based on the estimated fair values on the respective acquisition dates. Based on these values, the excess purchase prices over the fair value of the net assets acquired are allocated to goodwill. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, goodwill and trade name intangible assets which have indefinite lives totaled $ 138.3 million and $ 34.1 million, respectively. The Company assesses potential impairment of its goodwill and intangible assets when there is evidence that events or circumstances have occurred that would indicate the recovery of an asset’s carrying value is unlikely. The Company also assesses potential impairment of its goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives on an annual basis regardless of whether there is evidence of impairment. If indicators of impairment were to be present in intangible assets used in operations and future discounted cash flows -67- were not expected to be sufficient to recover the assets’ carrying amount, an impairment loss would be charged to expense in the period identified. The amount of an impairment loss would be recognized as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. Factors the Company considers important, which may cause impairment include, among others, significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired asset, negative industry or economic trends, and significant underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results. The impairment review of the Company’s goodwill is performed by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value to determine if the goodwill is impaired. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, then goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit were to exceed its fair value, then a goodwill impairment loss is recorded for the amount the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value. The Company conducted its annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of 2021. The impairment analysis did no t result in an impairment charge for the fiscal year ended 2021. There were no impairment charges in 2020 or 2019. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The Company based its fair value estimates on assumptions that it believes are reasonable but are uncertain and subject to changes in market conditions. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed as net income divided by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is computed assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive securities including the dilutive effects of stock options, unvested restricted stock awards and other potentially dilutive securities. The table below presents the weighted-average common stock used to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share: (in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Weighted-average common stock for calculating basic earnings per share 24,220 24,157 24,250 Effect of potentially dilutive securities from equity-based compensation 295 374 373 Weighted-average common stock for calculating diluted earnings per share 24,515 24,531 24,623 In 2021, 2020 and 2019, there were no shares having an anti-dilutive effect requiring exclusion from the computation of diluted earnings per share. The Company has made purchases of shares of its common stock from time to time in over-the-counter market (NASDAQ) transactions, through privately negotiated, large block transactions and through a share repurchase plan, in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In August 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to 2,000,000 shares of the Company's outstanding common stock (the “Repurchase Plan”). The amount and time of the specific repurchases are subject to prevailing market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors, including management’s discretion. All shares repurchased by the Company are canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares of common stock. There can be no assurance that any authorized shares will be repurchased and the Repurchase Plan may be modified, extended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, there were no shares of common stock repurchased. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the Company repurchased 282,221 shares of its common stock for an average purchase price of $ 48.25 per share or an aggregate price of $ 13.6 million. There were no repurchases of common stock during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2021, 1,309,805 shares remain authorized for repurchase. Accounts Receivable and Concentration of Credit Risk The Company’s accounts receivable consist of amounts due from customers for rentals, sales, financed sales and unbilled amounts for the portion of modular building end-of-lease services earned, which were negotiated as part of the lease agreement. Unbilled receivables related to end-of-lease services, which consists of dismantle and return delivery of buildings, were $ 46.2 million at December 31, 2021 and $ 38.7 million at December 31, 2020. The Company sells primarily on 30 -day terms, individually performs credit evaluation procedures on its customers on each transaction and will require security deposits from its customers when a significant credit risk is identified. The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts in amounts equal to the estimated losses expected to be incurred in the collection of the accounts receivable. The estimated losses are based on historical collection experience in conjunction with an -68- evaluation of the current status of the existing accounts. Customer accounts are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when an account is determined to be uncollectable. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the Company’s assessment of the collectability of customer accounts receivable from operating lease and non-lease revenues. The Company regularly reviews the allowance by considering factors such as historical payment experience and trends, the age of the accounts receivable balances, the Company’s operating segment, customer industry, credit quality and current economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay. The Company recognized bad debt expense of $ 0.5 million, $ 1.3 million and $ 1.0 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $ 2.1 million, $ 2.1 million and $ 1.9 million at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The allowance for doubtful accounts activity was as follows: (in thousands) 2021 2020 Beginning balance, January 1 $ 2,100 $ 1,883 Provision for doubtful accounts 451 1,343 Acquired Design Space Reserve (see Note 13) 125 — Write-offs, net of recoveries ( 551 ) ( 1,126 ) Ending balance, December 31 $ 2,125 $ 2,100 Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts receivable. From time to time, the Company maintains cash balances in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits. Net investment in sales-type leases The Company enters into sales-type leases with certain qualified customers to purchase its rental equipment, primarily at its TRS-RenTelco operating segment. Sales-type leases have terms that generally range from 12 to 36 months and are collateralized by a security interest in the underlying rental asset. The net investment in sales-type leases was $ 2.2 million at December 31, 2021 and $ 1.8 million at December 31, 2020. The Company’s assessment of current expected losses on these receivables was not material and no credit loss expense was provided as of December 31, 2021. The Company regularly reviews the allowance by considering factors such as historical payment experience, the age of the lease receivable balances, credit quality and current economic conditions that may affect a customer's ability to pay. Lease receivables are considered past due 90 days after invoice. The Company manages the credit risk in net investment in sales-type leases, on an ongoing basis, using a number of factors, including, but not limited to the following: historical payment history, credit score, size of operations, length of time in business, industry, historical profitability, historical cash flows, liquidity and past due amounts. The Company uses credit scores obtained from external credit bureaus as a key indicator for the purposes of determining credit quality of its new customers. The Company does not own available for sale debt securities or other financial assets at December 31, 2021. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company believes that the carrying amounts for cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and notes payable approximate their fair values except for fixed rate debt included in notes payable which has an estimated fair value of $ 158.5 million and $ 103.1 million compared to the recorded value of $ 160.0 million and $ 100.0 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The estimates of fair value of the Company’s fixed rate debt are based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for bank loans with similar terms and average maturities. Foreign Currency Transactions and Translation The Company's Canadian subsidiary, TRS-RenTelco Inc., a British Columbia corporation (“TRS-Canada”), functions as a branch sales office for TRS-RenTelco in Canada. The functional currency for TRS-Canada is the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses of TRS-Canada are reported in the results of operations in the period in which they occur. The Company’s Indian subsidiary, TRS-RenTelco India Private Limited (“TRS-India”), functioned as a rental and sales office for TRS-RenTelco in India, which commenced its closure during 2017. The functional currency for TRS-India is the Indian Rupee. All assets and liabilities of TRS-India are translated into U.S. dollars at period-end exchange rates and all income statement amounts are translated at the average exchange rate for each month within the year. Currently, the Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge its economic exposure with respect to assets, liabilities and firm commitments as the foreign currency transactions and risks to date have not been significant. -69- Share-Based Compensation The Company measures and recognizes the compensation expense for all share-based awards made to employees and directors, including stock options, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) and restricted stock units (“RSUs”), based upon estimated fair values. The fair value of stock options and SARs is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and for RSUs based upon the fair market value of the underlying shares of common stock as of the date of grant. The Company recognizes share-based compensation cost ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which generally equals the vesting period. For performance-based RSUs, compensation costs are recognized when it is probable that vesting conditions will be met. In addition, the Company estimates the probable number of shares of common stock that will be earned and the corresponding compensation cost until the achievement of the performance goal is known. The Company recognizes forfeitures based on actual forfeitures when they occur. The Company records share-based compensation costs in “Selling and administrative expenses” in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company recognizes a benefit from share-based compensation in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity if an incremental tax benefit is realized. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in “Note 8 –Benefit Plans”. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions in determining reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each period presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The most significant estimates included in the financial statements are the future cash flows and fair values used to determine the recoverability of the rental equipment and identifiable definite and indefinite lived intangible assets carrying value, the various assets’ useful lives and residual values, and the allowance for doubtful accounts. NOTE 2. IMPLEMENTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Effective January 1, 2021, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, expected to reduce cost and complexity related to the accounting for income taxes. The ASU removed specific exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 (GAAP). It eliminated the need for an organization to analyze whether the following apply in a given period: exception to the incremental approach for intra-period tax allocation; exceptions to accounting for basis differences when there are ownership changes in foreign investments; and exception in interim period income tax accounting for year-to-date losses that exceed anticipated losses. The ASU also improved financial statement preparers’ application of income tax-related guidance and simplifies GAAP for: franchise taxes that are partially based on income; transactions with a government that result in a step up in the tax basis of goodwill; separate financial statements of legal entities that are not subject to tax; and enacted changes in tax laws in interim periods. The adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. NOTE 3. LEASES Lessee The Company leases real estate for certain of its branch offices and rental equipment storage yards, vehicles and equipment used in its rental operations. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. The Company has leases with lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for separately. Right-Of-Use (“ROU”) assets and liabilities are recognized on the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Variable lease payments are excluded from the ROU assets and lease liabilities and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred, which are not material. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. The Company uses the interest rate stated in the lease as the discount rate. If the interest rate is not stated, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on information available on lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Many of the Company’s real estate lease agreements include options to extend the lease, which are not included in the minimum lease terms unless they are reasonably certain to be exercised. These leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that may extend the lease term from one to three years . The amount of payments associated with such options is not material. Short-term leases are leases having a term of twelve months or less and exclude leases with a lease term of one month or less. The Company recognizes short-term leases on a straight-line basis and does not record a related ROU asset or liability for such leases. At December 31, 2021 and 2020 the Company’s ROU assets and operating lease liabilities was $ 11.0 million and $ 8.3 million, respectively, which are recorded in Prepaid expenses and other assets and Accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the year ended December 31, 2021, operating lease expense was $ 5.4 million, which includes short term lease expense of $ 0.1 million. At December 31, 2021, the weighted-average remaining lease term for operating leases was 2.4 years and the weighted -70- average discount rate was 2.67 %. The Company had no sub-lease income during the year ended December 31 , 20 2 1 , and did no t have any finance leases as of December 31 , 20 2 1 . Supplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows: (in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities: Operating cash flows from operating leases $ 5,171 $ 3,683 Right of use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations: Operating leases $ 8,116 $ 1,885 As of December 31, 2021, maturities of operating lease liabilities were as follows: (in thousands) Year ended December 31, 2022 $ 5,702 2023 3,631 2024 1,613 2025 572 2026 33 Thereafter — Total lease payments 11,551 Less: imputed interest ( 555 ) $ 10,996 Lessor The Company’s equipment rentals for each of its operating segments are governed by agreements that detail the lease terms and conditions. The determination of whether these contracts with customers contain a lease generally does not require significant judgement. The Company accounts for these rentals as operating leases. These leases do not include material amounts of variable payments and the Company has made the accounting policy election to exclude all taxes assessed by a governmental authority. The Company generally does not provide an option for the lessee to purchase the rented equipment at the end of the lease term, thus, does not generate material revenue from sales of equipment under such options. Initial lease terms vary in length based upon customer needs and generally range from one to sixty months . Customers have the option to keep equipment on rent beyond the initial lease term on a month-to month basis based upon their needs. All of the Company’s rental products have long useful lives relative to the typical rental term with the original investment typically recovered in approximately three to five years . The rental products are typically rented for a majority of the time owned and a significant portion of the original investment is recovered when sold from inventory. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants. As of December 31, 2021, maturities of operating lease payments to be received in 2022 and thereafter were as follows: (in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2022 $ 101,446 2023 30,782 2024 10,761 2025 3,269 2026 1,414 Thereafter 180 $ 147,852 In the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company’s lease revenues were $ 442.6 million, consisting of $ 439.9 of operating lease revenues and $ 2.7 million of finance lease revenues. The Company has entered into finance leases to finance certain equipment sales to customers. The lease agreements have a bargain purchase option at the end of the lease term. For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company’s finance lease revenues included $ 2.5 million of sales revenues and $ 0.2 million of interest income. The minimum lease payments receivable and the net investment are included in Accounts receivable on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet for such leases, which were as follows: -71- (in thousands) December 31, 2021 Gross minimum lease payments receivable $ 2,392 Less – unearned interest ( 184 ) Net investment in finance lease receivables $ 2,208 As of December 31, 2021, the future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable finance leases to be received in 2022 and thereafter were as follows: (in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2022 $ 1,860 2023 270 2024 78 2025 — Total minimum future lease payments to be received $ 2,208 NOTE 4. REVENUE RECOGNITION The Company’s accounting for revenues is governed by two accounting standards. The majority of the Company’s revenues are considered lease or lease related and are accounted for in accordance with Topic 842, Leases. Revenues determined to be non-lease related are accounted for in accordance with ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606). The Company accounts for revenues when approval and commitment from both parties have been obtained, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. The Company typically recognizes non-lease related revenues at a point in time because the customer does not simultaneously consume the benefits of the Company’s promised goods and services, or performance obligations, and obtain control when delivery and installation are complete. For contracts that have multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in the contract based on the Company’s best estimate of the standalone selling prices of each distinct performance obligation in the contract. The standalone selling price is typically determined based upon the expected cost plus an estimated margin of each performance obligation. The Company generally rents and sells to customers on 30 day payment terms. The Company does not typically offer variable payment terms, or accept non-monetary consideration. Amounts billed and due from the Company’s customers are classified as Accounts receivable on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. For certain sales of modular buildings, progress payments from the customer are received during the manufacturing of new equipment, or the preparation of used equipment. The advance payments are not considered a significant financing component because the payments are used to meet working capital needs during the contract and to protect the Company from the customer failing to adequately complete their obligations under the contract. These contract liabilities are included in Deferred income on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and totaled $ 16.8 million and $ 11.3 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Sales revenues totaling $ 9.8 million were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2021, which were included in the contract liability balance at December 31, 2020. For certain modular building sales, the customer retains a small portion of the contract price until full completion of the contract, which results in revenue earned in excess of billings. These unbilled contract assets are included in Accounts receivable on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and totaled $ 1.3 million and $ 1.4 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Lease Revenues Rental revenues from operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease for all operating segments. Rental billings for periods extending beyond period end are recorded as deferred income and are recognized in the period earned. Rental related services revenues are primarily associated with relocatable modular building and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes leases. For modular building leases, rental related services revenues for modifications, delivery, installation, dismantle and return -72- delivery are lease related because the payments are considered minimum lease payments that are an integral part of the negotiated lease agreement with the customer . These revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain leases are accounted for as sales-type leases. For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment. Other revenue s include interest income on sales-type leases and rental income on facility leases. Non-Lease Revenues Non-lease revenues are recognized in the period when control of the performance obligation is transferred, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services. For liquid and solid containment solutions, portable storage containers and electronic test equipment, rental related services revenues for delivery and return delivery are considered non-lease revenues. Sales revenues are typically recognized at a point in time, which occurs upon the completion of delivery, installation and acceptance of the equipment by the customer. Accounting for non-lease revenues requires judgment in determining the point in time the customer gains control of the equipment and the appropriate accounting period to recognize revenue. Sales taxes charged to customers are reported on a net basis and are excluded from revenues and expenses. The following table disaggregates the Company’s revenues by lease (within the scope of Topic 840) and non-lease revenues (within the scope of Topic 606) and the underlying service provided for the three years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019: (in thousands) Mobile Modular TRS- RenTelco Adler Tanks Enviroplex Consolidated Year Ended December 31, 2021 Leasing $ 269,175 $ 116,769 $ 56,654 $ — $ 442,598 Non-lease: Rental related services 25,034 2,469 22,487 — 49,990 Sales 68,982 19,788 2,930 31,081 122,781 Other 125 1,168 171 — 1,464 Total non-lease 94,141 23,425 25,588 31,081 174,235 Total revenues $ 363,316 $ 140,194 $ 82,242 $ 31,081 $ 616,833 2020 Leasing $ 235,003 $ 112,210 $ 54,710 $ — $ 401,923 Non-lease: Rental related services 22,576 2,618 21,320 — 46,514 Sales 63,863 24,461 1,386 32,737 122,447 Other 82 1,522 66 — 1,670 Total non-lease 86,521 28,601 22,772 32,737 170,631 Total revenues $ 321,524 $ 140,811 $ 77,482 $ 32,737 $ 572,554 2019 Leasing $ 234,032 $ 108,044 $ 68,917 $ — $ 410,993 Non-lease: Rental related services 18,964 2,599 27,634 — 49,197 Sales 47,045 18,995 1,266 39,814 107,120 Other 969 1,845 106 — 2,920 Total non-lease 66,978 23,439 29,006 39,814 159,237 Total revenues $ 301,010 $ 131,483 $ 97,923 $ 39,814 $ 570,230 Customer returns of rental equipment prior to the end of the rental contract term are typically billed a cancellation fee, which is recorded as rental revenue in the period billed. Sales of new relocatable modular buildings, portable storage containers, electronic test equipment and related accessories and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes not manufactured by the Company are typically -73- covered by warranties provided by the manufacturer of the products sold. The Company typically provides limited 90 -day warranties for certain sales of used rental equipment and one-year warranties on equipment manufactured by Enviroplex. Although the Company’s policy is to provide reserves for warranties when required for specific circumstances, the Company has not found it necessary to establish such reserves to date as warranty costs have not been significant. The Company’s incremental cost of obtaining lease contracts, which consists of salesperson commissions, are deferred and amortized over the initial lease term for modular building leases. Incremental costs for obtaining a contract for all other operating segments are expensed in the period incurred because the lease term is typically less than 12 months. NOTE 5.

The Credit Facility provides for a $ 420.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (which may be further increased to $ 670.0 million by adding one or more tranches of term loans and/or increasing the aggregate revolving commitments), which includes a $ 25.0 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a $ 10.0 million sublimit for swingline loans. The proceeds of the Credit Facility are available to be used for general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions. The Credit Facility permits the Company’s existing indebtedness to remain, which includes the Company’s $ 12.0 million Treasury Sweep Note due March 31, 2025 , the Company’s existing senior notes issued pursuant to the Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement with Prudential Investment Management, Inc., dated as of April 21, 2011 (as amended, the “the Prior NPA”): (i) the $ 40.0 million aggregate outstanding principal of notes issued March 17, 2014 and which were repaid on March 17, 2021 , and (ii) the $ 60.0 million aggregate outstanding principal of notes issued November 5, 2015 and due November 5, 2022 . In addition, the Company may incur additional senior note indebtedness in an aggregate amount not to exceed $ 250.0 million. The Credit Facility matures on March 31, 2025 and replaced the Company’s prior $ 420.0 million credit facility dated March 31, 2016 with Bank of America, N.A., as agent, as amended. All obligations outstanding under the prior credit facility as of the date of the Credit Facility were refinanced by the Credit Facility on March 31, 2020. On March 30, 2020, the Company entered into an amended and restated Credit Facility Letter Agreement and a Credit Line Note in favor of MUFG Union Bank, N.A., which provides for a $ 12.0 million line of credit facility related to its cash management services (“Sweep Service Facility”). The Sweep Service Facility matures on the earlier of March 31, 2025 , or the date the Company ceases to -74- utilize MUFG Union Bank, N.A. for its cash management services. The Sweep Service Facility replaced the Company’s prior $12.0 million sweep service facility, dated as of March 31, 2016. At December 31, 2021, under the Credit Facility and Sweep Service Facility, the Company had unsecured lines of credit that permit it to borrow up to $ 432.0 million of which $ 266.5 million was outstanding. The Amended Credit Facility contains financial covenants requiring the Company to not (all defined terms used below not otherwise defined herein have the meaning assigned to such terms in the Amended Credit Facility): • Permit the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges as of the end of any fiscal quarter to be less than 2.50 to 1. At December 31, 2021, the actual ratio was 4.08 to 1. • Permit the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of funded debt to EBITDA at any time during any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters to be greater than 2.75 to 1. At December 31, 2021, the actual ratio was 1.73 to 1. Amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility bear interest at the Company’s option at either: (i) LIBOR plus a defined margin, or (ii) the Agent bank’s prime rate (“base rate”) plus a margin. The applicable margin for each type of loan is measured based upon the Consolidated Leverage Ratio at the end of the prior fiscal quarter and ranges from 1.00 % to 1.75 % for LIBOR loans and 0 % to 0.75 % for base rate loans. In addition, the Company pays an unused commitment fee for the portion of the $ 420.0 million credit facility that is not used. These fees are based upon the Consolidated Leverage Ratio and range from 0.15 % to 0.30 %. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the applicable margins were 1.25 % for LIBOR based loans, 0.25 % for base rate loans and 0.20 % for unused fees. Amounts borrowed under the Sweep Service Facility are based upon the MUFG Union Bank, N.A. base rate plus an applicable margin and an unused commitment fee for the portion of the $ 12.0 million facility not used. The applicable base rate margin and unused commitment fee rates for the Sweep Service Facility are the same as for the Amended Credit Facility. The following information relates to the lines of credit for each of the following periods: (dollar amounts in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2021 2020 Maximum amount outstanding $ 389,740 $ 199,471 Average amount outstanding $ 239,134 $ 170,075 Weighted average interest rate, during the period 2.07 % 2.11 % Prime interest rate, end of period 3.25 % 3.25 % Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement On March 31, 2020, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement (the “Note Purchase Agreement”) with PGIM, Inc. (“PGIM”) and the holders of Series B and Series C Notes previously issued pursuant to the Prior NPA, among the Company and the other parties to the Note Purchase Agreement. The Note Purchase Agreement amended and restated, and superseded in its entirety, the Prior NPA. Pursuant to the Prior NPA, the Company issued (i) $ 40.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.68 % Series B Senior Notes, which were repaid on March 17, 2021 , and (ii) $ 60.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.84 % Series C Senior Notes due November 5, 2022 , to which the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement shall apply. In addition, pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, the Company may authorize the issuance and sale of additional senior notes (the “Shelf Notes”) in the aggregate principal amount of (x) $ 250 million minus (y) the amount of other notes (such as the Series B Senior Notes and Series C Senior Notes, each defined below) then outstanding, to be dated the date of issuance thereof, to mature, in case of each Shelf Note so issued, no more than 15 years after the date of original issuance thereof, to have an average life, in the case of each Shelf Note so issued, of no more than 15 years after the date of original issuance thereof, to bear interest on the unpaid balance thereof from the date thereof at the rate per annum, and to have such other particular terms, as shall be set forth, in the case of each Shelf Note so issued, in accordance with the Note Purchase Agreement. Shelf Notes may be issued and sold from time to time at the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors and in such amounts as the Board of Directors may determine, subject to prospective purchasers’ agreement to purchase the Shelf Notes. The Company will sell the Shelf Notes directly to such purchasers. The full net proceeds of each Shelf Note will be used in the manner described in the applicable Request for Purchase with respect to such Shelf Note. 3.84% Senior Notes Due in 2022 On November 5, 2015, the Company issued and sold to the purchasers a $ 60.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.84 % Series C Senior Notes (the “Series C Senior Notes”) pursuant to the terms of the Prior NPA. The Series C Senior Notes are an unsecured obligation of the Company and bear interest at a rate of 3.84% per annum and mature on November 5, 2022 . Interest on the Series C Senior Notes is payable semi-annually beginning on May 5, 2016 and continuing thereafter on November 5 and May 5 of each year until maturity. The principal balance is due when the notes mature on November 5, 2022. The full net proceeds from the Series C Senior -75- Notes were used to reduce the outstanding balance on the Company’s revolving credit line. At December 31, 2020, the principal balance outstanding under the Series C Senior Notes was $ 60.0 million. 2.57% Senior Notes Due in 2028 On March 17, 2021, the Company issued and sold to the purchasers $ 40 million aggregate principal amount of 2.57 % Series D Notes (the “Series D Senior Notes”) pursuant to the terms of the Amended and Restated Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement, dated March 31, 2020 (the “Note Purchase Agreement”), among the Company, PGIM, Inc. and the noteholders party thereto.

The Series E Senior Notes are an unsecured obligation of the Company and bear interest at a rate of 2.35 % per annum and mature on June 16, 2026 . Interest on the Series E Senior Notes is payable semi-annually beginning on December 16, 2021 and continuing thereafter on June 16 and December 16 of each year until maturity. The principal balance is due when the notes mature on June 16, 2026. The full net proceeds from the Series E Senior Notes were used to pay down the Company’s credit facility. At December 31, 2021, the principal balance outstanding under the Series E Senior Notes was $ 60.0 million. Among other restrictions, the Note Purchase Agreement, which has superseded in its entirety the Prior NPA, under which the Series C Senior Notes, Series D Senior Notes and Series E Senior Notes were sold, contains financial covenants requiring the Company to not (all defined terms used below not otherwise defined herein have the meaning assigned to such terms in the Note Purchase Agreement): • Permit the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges as of the end of any fiscal quarter to be less than 2.50 to 1.

The wind down of operations in India began in 2017. As a result, a valuation allowance was recorded against the deferred tax assets that resulted primarily from accumulated net operating loss carry forwards in India that management estimated the benefit of which will not be realized. As of December 31, 2021, the Company’s foreign net operating losses for tax purposes were $ 0.6 million. If not realized, these carry forwards will begin to expire in 2023 . For income tax purposes, deductible compensation related to share-based awards is based on the value of the award when realized, which may be different than the compensation expense recognized by the company for financial statement purposes which is based on the award value on the date of grant. The difference between the value of the award upon grant, and the value of the award when -77- ultimately realized, creates either additional tax expense or benefit. In 20 2 1 , 20 20 and 201 9 exercise of share-based awards by employees resulted in an excess tax benefit of $ 2.5 million , $ 1.9 million and $ 2.1 million , respectively . The Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. The Company evaluated all of its tax positions for which the statute of limitations remained open and determined there were no material unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. In addition, there have been no material changes in unrecognized benefits during 2021, 2020 and 2019. The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various states and foreign jurisdictions. Tax regulations within each jurisdiction are subject to interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and require the application of significant judgment. Our income tax returns are subject to examination by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. There may be differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations, and as a result, disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of income. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for the years before 2017. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision (benefit) for income taxes in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income for all periods presented. Such interest and penalties were not significant for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. NOTE 7. BENEFIT PLANS Stock Plans The Company adopted the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2016 Plan”), effective June 8, 2016, under which 2,000,000 shares of the common stock of the Company, plus the number of shares that remain available for grants of awards under the Company's 2007 Stock Option Plan (the “2007 Plan”) become available as a result of forfeiture, termination, or expiration of awards previously granted under the 2007 Plan, were reserved for the grant of equity awards to its employees, directors and consultants. The equity awards have a maximum term of 7 years at an exercise price of not less than 100 % of the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date the equity award is granted. The 2016 Plan replaced the 2007 Plan. The 2016 Plan provides for the grant of awards in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), the vesting of which may be performance-based or service-based, and other rights and benefits. Each RSU issued reduces the number of shares of the Company’s common stock available for grant under the 2016 Plan by two shares. There were no modifications to the 2016 Plan and no awards classified as liabilities in the year ended December 31, 2021. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the share-based compensation expense was $ 7.7 million, $ 5.5 million and $ 5.9 million, respectively, before provision for income taxes. The Company recorded a tax benefit of approximately $ 2.1 million, $ 1.5 million and $ 1.6 million, respectively, related to the aforementioned share-based compensation expenses. There was no capitalized share-based compensation expense in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Stock Options As of December 31, 2021, a cumulative total of 8,458,600 shares subject to options have been granted with exercise prices ranging from $ 3.47 to $ 40.37 . Of these, options have been exercised for the purchase of 6,511,238 shares, while options for 1,672,732 shares have been terminated, and options for 274,630 shares with exercise prices ranging from $ 24.60 to $ 40.37 remained outstanding under the stock plans. These options vest over five years and expire seven years after grant. To date, no options have been issued to any of the Company’s non-employee advisors. As of December 31, 2021, 1,414,352 shares remained available for issuance of awards under the stock plans. -78- A summary of the Company’s option activity and related information for the three years ended December 31, 2021 is as follows: Number of options Weighted- average price Weighted- average remaining contractual term (in years) Aggregate intrinsic value (in millions) Balance at December 31, 2018 845,600 $ 28.14 Options granted — — Options exercised ( 260,860 ) 29.55 Options cancelled/forfeited/expired ( 4,600 ) 30.59 Balance at December 31, 2019 580,140 29.57 Options granted — — Options exercised ( 163,670 ) 30.22 Options cancelled/forfeited/expired ( 7,060 ) 28.95 Balance at December 31, 2020 409,410 29.33 Options granted — — Options exercised ( 133,020 ) 28.57 Options cancelled/forfeited/expired ( 1,760 ) 34.57 Balance at December 31, 2021 274,630 $ 29.66 1.69 $ 13.9 Exercisable at December 31, 2021 261,250 $ 29.39 1.66 $ 13.3 Expected to vest after December 31, 2021 13,038 $ 34.97 2.29 $ 0.6 The intrinsic value of stock options at any point in time is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying awards and the quoted price of the Company’s common stock. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised and sold under the Company’s stock option plans was $ 16.2 million, $ 11.9 million and $ 9.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, determined as of the date of option exercise. As of December 31, 2021, there was approximately $ 0.1 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation option arrangements granted under the Company’s stock plans, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of less than one year . The following table indicates the options outstanding and options exercisable by exercise price with the weighted-average remaining contractual life for the options outstanding and the weighted-average exercise price at December 31, 2021: Options Outstanding Options Exercisable Exercise price Number outstanding at December 31, 2021 Weighted-average remaining contractual life (Years) Weighted-average grant date value Number exercisable at December 31, 2021 Weighted-average grant date value $20 – 25 137,585 1.17 $ 24.60 137,585 $ 24.60 $25 – 30 — — $ — — $ — $30 – 35 129,225 2.22 $ 34.47 116,865 $ 34.46 $35 – 40 6,800 2.00 $ 39.19 6,800 $ 39.19 $40 – 45 1,020 2.67 $ 40.37 — $ 40.37 $20 – 45 274,630 1.69 $ 29.66 261,250 $ 29.39 The Company utilizes the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of share-based compensation at the date of grant, which requires the use of accounting judgment and financial estimates, including estimates of the expected term option holders will retain their vested stock options before exercising them, the estimated volatility of the Company’s stock price over the expected term and the expected number of options that will be forfeited prior to the completion of their vesting requirements. Application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different estimates of the fair value of share-based compensation amounts recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. No options were granted in 2021, 2020 and 2019. -79- Restricted Stock Units The following table summarizes the activity of the Company’s RSUs, which includes service-based and performance-based awards, for the three years ended December 31, 2021: Weighted- Aggregate average intrinsic Number grant date value of shares fair value (in millions) Balance at December 31, 2018 139,510 $ 44.73 RSUs granted 83,440 59.98 RSUs vested ( 25,862 ) 48.31 RSUs cancelled/forfeited/expired ( 840 ) 59.84 Balance at December 31, 2019 196,248 50.68 RSUs granted 126,540 50.99 RSUs vested ( 89,225 ) 43.42 RSUs cancelled/forfeited/expired ( 7,593 ) 57.93 Balance at December 31, 2020 225,970 57.06 RSUs granted 116,326 72.75 RSUs vested ( 116,242 ) 53.32 RSUs cancelled/forfeited/expired ( 8,646 ) 52.78 Balance at December 31, 2021 217,408 $ 67.63 $ 17.4 Performance-based RSUs issued prior to 2018 vest over five years , with 60 % of the shares immediately vesting after three years when the performance criteria has been determined to have been met and 20 % of the remaining shares vesting annually at the anniversary of the performance determination date, subject to continuous employment of the participant. The performance-based RSU grants issued in 2018 and thereafter vest after three years with 100 % of the shares vesting immediately when performance criteria has been determined to have been met. There were 116,989 performance-based RSUs expected to vest as of December 31, 2021. Service based RSUs issued to the Company’s directors generally vest over twelve to fourteen months . Service based RSUs issued to the Company’s management vest over three years. There were 111,631 service-based RSUs expected to vest as of December 31, 2021. No forfeitures are currently expected. The total fair value of RSUs that vested during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 based on the weighted average grant date values was $ 6.2 million, $ 3.9 million and $ 1.2 million, respectively. Share-based compensation expense for RSUs for the year ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $ 7.3 million, $ 4.6 million and $ 4.7 , respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSUs was $ 14.8 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.4 years. Employee Stock Ownership and 401(k) Plans The McGrath RentCorp Employee Stock Ownership and 401(k) Plan (the “KSOP”) provides that each participant may annually contribute an elected percentage of his or her salary, not to exceed the statutory limit. Each employee who has at least two months of service with the Company and is 21 years or older, is eligible to participate in the KSOP. The Company, at its discretion, may make matching contributions. Contributions are expensed in the year approved by the Board of Directors. Dividends on the Company’s stock held by the KSOP are treated as ordinary dividends and, in accordance with existing tax laws, are deducted by the Company in the year paid. For the year ended December 31, 2021 dividends deducted by the Company were $ 0.4 million, which resulted in a tax benefit of approximately $ 0.1 million in 2021. At December 31, 2021, the KSOP held 245,780 shares, or 1 % of the Company’s total common shares outstanding. These shares are included in basic and diluted earnings per share calculations. NOTE 8. SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY The Company has in the past made purchases of shares of its common stock from time to time in over-the-counter market (NASDAQ) transactions, through privately negotiated, large block transactions and through a share repurchase plan, in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In August 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase 2,000,000 shares of the Company's outstanding common stock (the “Repurchase Plan”). The amount and time of the specific repurchases are subject to prevailing market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors, including management’s discretion. All shares repurchased by the Company are canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares of common -80- stock. There can be no assurance that any authorized shares will be repurchased and the repurchase program may be modified, extended or terminated by the B oard of D irectors at any time. There were no share s of common stock repurchased during the twelve months ended December 31, 202 1 . There were 282,221 shares of common stock repurchased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 for the aggregate purchase price of $ 13.6 million or an average price of $ 48.25 per repurchased share. As of December 31, 20 2 1 , 1,309,805 shares remain authorized for repurchase under the Repurchase Plan . NOTE 9. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company leases certain facilities under various operating leases. Most of the lease agreements provide the Company with the option of renewing its lease at the end of the lease term, at the fair rental value. In most cases, management expects that in the normal course of business, facility leases will be renewed or replaced by other leases. Minimum payments under these leases, exclusive of property taxes and insurance, are as follows: (in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2022 $ 4,993 2023 3,170 2024 1,495 2025 532 2026 33 $ 10,223 Facility rent expense was $ 5.6 million in 2021, $ 3.7 million in 2020 and $ 3.9 million in 2019. The Company is involved in various lawsuits and routine claims arising out of the normal course of its business. The Company maintains insurance coverage for its operations and employees with appropriate aggregate, per occurrence and deductible limits as the Company reasonably determines necessary or prudent with current operations and historical experience. The major policies include coverage for property, general liability, auto, directors and officers, health, and workers’ compensation insurances. The Company records a provision for a liability when it believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. The Company reviews these provisions at least quarterly and adjusts these provisions to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Litigation is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Company’s control. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility that the ultimate amount of liability not covered by insurance, if any, under any pending litigation and claims, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the financial position or operating results of the Company. The Company’s health plans are self-funded high deductible plans with annual stop-loss insurance of $ 200,000 per claim. Beginning in 2019, the Company’s workers compensation insurance is underwritten by an insurance company with no stop-loss value and $ 350,000 for prior claim years. Insurance providers are responsible for making claim payments that exceed these amounts on an individual claim basis. In addition, the Company has stop loss insurance that pays for claim payments made during a twelve month coverage period that exceeds certain specified thresholds in the aggregate. The Company records an expense when health and workers compensation claim payments are made and accrues for the portion of claims incurred, but not yet paid at period end. The Company makes these accruals based upon a combination of historical claim payments, loss development experience and actuarial estimates. A high degree of judgment is required in developing the underlying assumptions and the resulting amounts to be accrued. In addition, our assumptions will change as the Company’s loss experience develops. All of these factors have the potential for impacting the amounts previously accrued and the Company may be required to increase or decrease the amounts previously accrued. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, accruals for the Company’s health and workers’ compensation high deductible plans were $ 2.5 million and $ 2.2 million, respectively. -81- NOTE 10.

Amortization expense in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $ 5.9 million, $ 0.2 million and $ 0.9 million, respectively. Based on the carrying values at December 31, 2021 and assuming no subsequent impairment of the underlying assets, the annual amortization is expected to be $ 5.9 million in 2022 through 2025, $ 5.4 million in 2026 and $ 5.2 million in 2027. NOTE 11. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS There were no significant related party transactions in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, or amounts owed to related parties at such dates. -82- NOTE 12. SEGMENT REPORTING FASB guidelines establish annual and interim reporting standards for an enterprise’s operating segments and related disclosures about its products, services, geographic areas and major customers. In accordance with these guidelines the Company’s four reportable segments are Mobile Modular, TRS-RenTelco, Adler Tanks and Enviroplex. Management focuses on several key measures to evaluate and assess each segment’s performance including rental revenue growth, gross margin, and income before provision for income taxes. Excluding interest expense, allocations of revenue and expense not directly associated with one of these segments are generally allocated to Mobile Modular, TRS-RenTelco and Adler Tanks, based on their pro-rata share of direct revenues. Interest expense is allocated amongst Mobile Modular, TRS-RenTelco and Adler Tanks based on their pro-rata share of average rental equipment at cost, goodwill, intangible assets, accounts receivable, deferred income and customer security deposits. The Company does not report total assets by business segment. Summarized financial information for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, for the Company’s reportable segments is shown in the following tables: (dollar amounts in thousands) Mobile Modular TRS- RenTelco Adler Tanks Enviroplex 1 Consolidated Year Ended December 31, 2021 Rental revenues $ 220,569 $ 113,419 $ 56,025 $ — $ 390,013 Rental related services revenues 72,330 2,880 22,851 — 98,061 Sales and other revenues 70,417 23,895 3,366 31,081 128,759 Total revenues 363,316 140,194 82,242 31,081 616,833 Depreciation of rental equipment 28,071 47,374 16,442 — 91,887 Gross profit 176,040 61,394 33,699 9,888 281,021 Selling and administrative expenses 92,603 25,152 25,542 5,303 148,600 Income from operations 83,436 36,243 8,157 4,585 132,421 Interest expense (income) allocation 6,433 2,270 2,211 ( 459 ) 10,455 Income before provision for income taxes 77,003 33,763 5,946 5,044 121,756 Adjusted EBITDA 128,044 85,723 27,961 4,844 246,572 Rental equipment acquisitions 188,392 61,097 191 — 249,680 Accounts receivable, net (period end) 112,295 22,115 16,378 8,711 159,499 Rental equipment, at cost (period end) 1,040,094 361,391 309,908 — 1,711,393 Rental equipment, net book value (period end) 751,537 161,900 151,787 — 1,065,224 Utilization (period end) 2 76.4 % 62.9 % 47.6 % Average utilization 2 76.2 % 67.0 % 45.4 % -83- Segment Data (Continued) (dollar amounts in thousands) Mobile Modular TRS- RenTelco Adler Tanks Enviroplex 1 Consolidated Year Ended December 31, 2020 Rental revenues $ 188,719 $ 109,083 $ 53,988 $ — $ 351,790 Rental related services revenues 67,527 3,080 21,786 — 92,393 Sales and other revenues 65,278 28,648 1,708 32,737 128,371 Total revenues 321,524 140,811 77,482 32,737 572,554 Depreciation of rental equipment 22,967 46,472 16,427 — 85,866 Gross profit 155,874 60,864 34,079 12,929 263,746 Selling and administrative expenses 68,470 24,306 24,764 5,453 122,993 Income from operations 87,404 36,558 9,315 7,476 140,753 Interest expense (income) allocation 5,104 2,133 2,107 ( 557 ) 8,787 Income before benefit for income taxes 82,300 34,503 7,208 8,033 132,044 Adjusted EBITDA 119,202 85,082 29,010 7,729 241,023 Rental equipment acquisitions 39,078 42,588 2,541 — 84,207 Accounts receivable, net (period end) 81,640 22,735 13,655 5,286 123,316 Rental equipment, at cost (period end) 882,115 333,020 315,706 — 1,530,841 Rental equipment, net book value (period end) 611,590 156,536 169,990 — 938,116 Utilization (period end) 2 76.0 % 67.4 % 39.8 % Average utilization 2 77.2 % 66.2 % 44.6 % 2019 Rental revenues $ 182,316 $ 103,704 $ 67,869 $ — $ 353,889 Rental related services revenues 69,395 3,260 28,383 — 101,038 Sales and other revenues 49,299 24,519 1,671 39,814 115,303 Total revenues 301,010 131,483 97,923 39,814 570,230 Depreciation of rental equipment 22,071 41,948 16,372 — 80,391 Gross profit 143,618 60,748 47,014 14,785 266,165 Selling and administrative expenses 65,699 24,645 29,321 5,128 124,793 Income from operations 77,919 36,103 17,693 9,657 141,372 Interest expense (income) allocation 7,946 1,970 3,436 ( 1,021 ) 12,331 Income before benefit for income taxes 69,973 34,217 14,257 10,678 129,125 Adjusted EBITDA 107,166 80,772 38,993 9,892 236,823 Rental equipment acquisitions 75,433 89,759 4,826 — 170,018 Accounts receivable, net (period end) 83,182 23,788 17,281 3,848 128,099 Rental equipment, at cost (period end) 868,807 335,343 316,261 — 1,520,411 Rental equipment, net book value (period end) 610,048 172,413 185,039 — 967,500 Utilization (period end) 2 79.1 % 64.5 % 48.4 % Average utilization 2 79.2 % 66.2 % 54.7 % 1 Gross Enviroplex sales revenues were $ 32,095 , $ 34,014 and $ 39,814 in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. There were $ 1,014 and $ 1,277 inter-segment sales to Mobile Modular in 2021 and 2020, which have been eliminated in consolidation. There were no inter-segment sales in 2019. 2 Utilization is calculated each month by dividing the cost of rental equipment on rent by the total cost of rental equipment excluding new equipment inventory and accessory equipment. The average utilization for the period is calculated using the average costs of rental equipment. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues during 2021, 2020 and 2019. Revenue from foreign country customers accounted for 4 %, 4 % and 5 % of the Company’s revenues for the same periods, respectively. NOTE 13. ACQUISITIONS -84- On May 17, 2021, the Company completed the purchase of substantially all of the assets of Design Space Modular Buildings PNW, LP (“Design Space”) for $ 267.3 million in cash consideration on the closing date. Design Space provides modular buildings and portable storage containers rental and sale solutions to customers in the West and Pacific Northwest states in the U.S. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase of a “business” in accordance with criteria in Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 805 – “Business Combinations” using the purchase method of accounting. Under the purchase method of accounting, the total purchase price is assigned to tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values on the closing date. The excess of the purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill. As part of the Design Space acquisition, the Company entered into a non-compete agreement with the sellers. The cash consideration allocated to the non-compete agreement totaled $ 2.5 million. This intangible asset was not considered part of the purchase price consideration and included in the table below as the sellers subject to the non-compete agreement did not continue with the Company. The financial results of Design Space were a part of the Mobile Modular segment since May 17, 2021, including $ 1.7 million of transaction costs. On April 1, 2021 the Company completed the purchase of assets of GRS Holding LLC, DBA Kitchens To Go (“Kitchens To Go”) for $ 18.3 million in cash consideration. Kitchens To Go provides interim and permanent modular kitchen solutions for foodservice providers that require flexible facilities to continue or expand operations. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase of a “business” in accordance with criteria in ASC 805 using the purchase method of accounting. The financial results of Kitchens To Go were a part of the Mobile Modular segment since April 1, 2021, including $ 0.3 million of transaction costs. The following tables summarize the purchase price allocations reflecting estimated fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the Design Space and Kitchens To Go acquisitions, with excess amounts allocated to goodwill. The valuation of intangible assets acquired is based on certain valuation assumptions including cash flow projections, discount rates, contributory asset charges and other valuation model inputs. The valuation of tangible long-lived assets acquired is dependent upon various analyses including an analysis of the condition and estimated remaining economic lives of the assets acquired.

The combined acquired goodwill of $ 104,196 reflects the strategic fit of Design Space and Kitchens to Go with the Company’s modular business operations. The Company will amortize the acquired customer relationships, tradename, non-compete and customer backlog over their expected useful lives of 8 years, 8 years, 5 years and 6 months, respectively. Goodwill is expected to have an indefinite life and will be subject to future impairment testing. The goodwill is deductible for tax purposes over 15 years. The following unaudited pro forma financial information shows the combined results of operations of the Company, Design Space and Kitchens To Go as if the acquisitions occurred as of the beginning of the periods presented. The pro forma results include the effects of the amortization of the purchased intangible assets and depreciation expense of acquired rental equipment valuation step up, interest expense on the debt incurred to finance the acquisitions. A pro forma adjustment has been made to reflect the income taxes that would have been recorded at the combined federal and state statutory rate of 28 % on the acquisitions’ combined net income. The pro forma results for the year ended December 31, 2020 have been adjusted to include transaction related costs. This pro forma data is presented for informational purposes only and does not purport to be indicative of the results of the future operations or the results that would have occurred had the acquisitions taken place in the periods noted below: (Unaudited) Year Ended December 31, (dollar amounts in thousands, except for per share amounts) 2021 2020 Pro-forma total revenues $ 647,866 $ 670,207 Pro-forma net income $ 93,065 $ 112,029 Pro-forma basic earnings per share $ 3.84 $ 4.64 Pro-forma diluted earnings per share $ 3.80 $ 4.57 Design Space and Kitchens To Go Actual total revenues $ 39,056 Actual net income $ 2,671 Actual basic earnings per share $ 0.11 Actual diluted earnings per share $ 0.11 On December 31, 2021 the Company completed the purchase of the assets of Titan Storage Containers, LLC (“Titan”) for $ 6.6 million in cash consideration on the closing date and $ 0.3 million remaining liability to the seller. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase of “assets” in accordance with criteria in ASC 805 and the initial assessment of the fair value of the purchased assets was allocated primarily to rental equipment totaling $ 6.2 million and rolling stock assets totaling $ 0.8 million, partially offset by accrued liabilities of $ 0.2 million. The rolling stock assets include delivery trucks, delivery trailers, trucks and forklifts. Supplemental pro forma prior year information has not been provided as the historical financial results of Titan were not significant. Incremental transaction costs associated with the asset purchase were not significant. -86- ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE. None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Company’s management under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in rules promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) for the Company. Based on their evaluation the CEO and CFO have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2021. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. During the last quarter of the Company’s fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and the CEO and CFO have concluded that these controls and procedures are effective at the “reasonable assurance” level. Management’s Assessment of Internal Control. Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, is discussed in the Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting included on page 57. The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 has been audited by Grant Thornton LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, and its report is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS. General Overview McGrath RentCorp (the “Company”) is a California corporation organized in 1979 with corporate offices located in Livermore, California. The Company’s common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “MGRC”. References in this report to the “Company”, “we”, “us”, and “ours” refer to McGrath RentCorp and its subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise. The Company is a diversified business-to-business rental company with four rental divisions: relocatable modular buildings, portable storage containers, electronic test equipment, and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes. Although the Company’s primary emphasis is on equipment rentals, sales of equipment occur in the normal course of business. The Company is comprised of four reportable business segments: (1) its modular building and portable storage segment (“Mobile Modular”); (2) its electronic test equipment segment (“TRS-RenTelco”); (3) its containment solutions for the storage of hazardous and non-hazardous liquids and solids segment (“Adler Tanks”); and (4) its classroom manufacturing business selling modular buildings used primarily as classrooms in California (“Enviroplex”). No single customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues during 2020, 2019 and 2018. Revenue from foreign country customers accounted for 4%, 5% and 4% of the Company’s revenues in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Business Model The Company invests capital in rental products and generally has recovered its original investment through rents less cash operating expenses in a relatively short period of time compared to the product’s rental life. When the Company’s rental products are sold, the proceeds generally have covered a high percentage of the original investment. With these characteristics, a significant base of rental assets on rent generates a considerable amount of operating cash flows to support continued rental asset growth. The Company’s rental products have the following characteristics: • The product required by the customer tends to be expensive compared to the Company’s monthly rental charge, with the interim rental solution typically evaluated as a less costly alternative. • Generally, we believe the Company’s customers have a short-term need for our rental products. The customer’s rental requirement may be driven by a number of factors including time, budget or capital constraints, future uncertainty impacting their ongoing requirements, equipment availability, specific project requirements, peak periods of demand or the customer may want to eliminate the burdens and risks of ownership. 2 • All of the Company’s rental products have long useful lives relative to the typical rental term. Modular buildings (“ modulars ”) have an estimated life of eighteen years compared to the typical rental term of twelve to twenty-four months, electronic test equipment has an estimated life range of one to eight years (depending on the type of product) compared to a typical rental term of one to six months, and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes have an estimated life of twenty years compared to typical rental terms of one to six months. • We believe short-term rental rates typically recover the Company’s original investment quickly based on the respective product’s annual yield, or annual rental revenues divided by the average cost of rental equipment. For modulars the original investment is recovered in approximately five years, in approximately three years for electronic test equipment and in approximately four years for liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes. • When a product is sold from our rental inventory, a significant portion of the original investment is usually recovered. Effective asset management is a critical element to each of the rental businesses and the residuals realized when product is sold from inventory. Modular asset management requires designing and building the product for a long life, coupled with ongoing repair and maintenance investments, to ensure its long useful rental life and generally higher residuals upon sale. Electronic test equipment asset management requires understanding, selecting and investing in equipment technologies that support market demand and, once invested, proactively managing the equipment at the model level for optimum utilization through its technology life cycle to maximize the rental revenues and residuals realized. Liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes asset management requires selecting and purchasing quality product and making ongoing repair and maintenance investments to ensure its long rental life. The Company believes that rental revenue growth from an increasing base of rental assets and improved gross profits on rents are the best measures of the health of each of our rental businesses. Additionally, we believe our business model and results are enhanced by operational leverage that is created from large regional sales and inventory centers for modulars, a single U.S. based sales, inventory and operations facility for electronic test equipment, as well as shared senior management and back office functions for financing, human resources, insurance, marketing, information technology and operating and accounting systems. Human Capital Management As of December 31, 2020, the Company had 1,061 employees, of whom 94 were primarily administrative and executive personnel, with 575, 174, 133 and 85 in the operations of Mobile Modular, Adler Tanks, TRS-RenTelco and Enviroplex, respectively. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and management believes its relationship with our employees is good. The Company believes its employees are key to its success and it is committed to all of its employees’ engagement, training and career development, and personal and professional growth. The Board of Directors also receives regular updates from senior management on matters relating to the Company’s strategy for the recruitment, retention and development of the Company’s employees. The Company provides training in technical, operational and managerial skills, and places special emphasis on safety, effective communications, customer service, and employee development. Additionally, the Company offers employees a tuition reimbursement program whereby the employee may receive reimbursement for tuition and fees for undergraduate or graduate level academic courses at an accredited two or four year college or university that may help employees improve performance in their current job or prepare them for advancement. Government Regulations We are subject to certain environmental, transportation, anti-corruption, import controls, health and safety and other laws and regulations in locations in which we operate. Our activity in jurisdictions in which we operate is additionally subject to anti-bribery laws and regulations, such as the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, which prevent companies and their officers, employees and agents from making payments to officials and public entities of foreign countries to facilitate obtaining new contracts. We are also subject to laws and regulations that govern and impose liability for activities that may have adverse environmental effects, including discharges into air and water, and handling and disposal of hazardous substances and waste. Our motor vehicles and related units are subject to regulation in certain states under motor vehicle and similar registrations. While we incur costs in our business to comply with these laws and regulations, management does not believe that the costs of compliance with these various governmental regulations is material to our business and financial condition. Available Information We make the Company’s Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) filings available at our website www.mgrc.com. These filings include our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Act of 1934, which are available as soon as reasonably practicable after the Company electronically files such material with, or furnishes such material to, the SEC. Information included on 3 our website is not incorporated by reference to this Form 10-K. Furthermore, all reports the Company files with the SEC are available through the SEC’s website at www.sec.gov. We have a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics which applies to all directors, officers and employees. Copies of this code can be obtained at our website www.mgrc.com .

Modulars vary from simple single-unit construction site offices to multi-floor modular complexes. The Company’s modular rental fleet includes a full range of styles and sizes. The Company considers its modulars to be among the most attractive and well-designed available. The units are constructed with wood or metal siding, sturdily built and physically capable of a long useful life. Modulars are generally provided with installed heat, air conditioning, lighting, electrical outlets and floor covering, and may have customized interiors including partitioning, cabinetry and plumbing facilities. Mobile Modular purchases new modulars from various manufacturers who build to Mobile Modular’s design specifications. During 2020, Mobile Modular purchased 45% of its modular units from one manufacturer. The Company believes that the loss of any of its primary modular manufacturers could have an adverse effect on its operations since Mobile Modular could experience higher prices and longer lead times for delivery of modular units until other manufacturers were able to increase their production capacity. The Company’s modulars are manufactured to comply with state building codes, have a low risk of obsolescence, and can be modified or reconfigured to accommodate a wide variety of customer needs. Historically, as state building codes have changed over the years, Mobile Modular has been able to continue to use existing modulars, with minimal, if any, required upgrades. The Company has no assurance that it will continue to be able to use existing modular equipment with minimal upgrades as building codes change in the future. Mobile Modular currently operates from regional sales and inventory centers in California, Texas, Florida, Georgia and Virginia, serving large geographic areas in these and surrounding states, and sales offices serving Louisiana, North Carolina and South Carolina. The regional sales and inventory centers have in-house infrastructure and operational capabilities to support quick and efficient repair, modification, and refurbishment of equipment for the next rental opportunity. The Company believes operating from large regional sales and inventory centers results in better operating margins as operating costs can be spread over a large installed customer base. Mobile Modular actively maintains and repairs its rental equipment, and management believes this ensures the continued use of the modular product over its long life and, when sold, has resulted in higher sale proceeds relative to its capitalized cost. When rental equipment returns from a customer, the necessary repairs and preventative maintenance are performed prior to its next rental. By making these expenditures for repair and maintenance throughout the equipment’s life we believe that older equipment can generally rent for rates similar to those of newer equipment. Management believes the condition of the equipment is a more significant factor in determining the rental rate and sale price than its age. Over the last three years, used equipment sold each year represented approximately 2% of rental equipment, and has been, on average, 15 years old with sale proceeds above its net book value. Competitive Strengths Market Leadership – The Company believes Mobile Modular is the largest supplier in California and Florida, and a significant supplier in Texas, of modular educational facilities for rental to both public and private schools. Management is knowledgeable about the needs of its educational customers and the related regulatory requirements in the states where Mobile Modular operates, which enables Mobile Modular to meet its customers’ specific project requirements. Expertise – The Company believes that over the 40 plus years during which Mobile Modular has competed in the modular rental industry, it has developed expertise that differentiates it from its competitors. Mobile Modular has dedicated its attention to continuously developing and improving the quality of its modular units. Mobile Modular has expertise in the licensing and regulatory requirements that govern modulars in the states where it operates, and its management, sales and operational staffs are knowledgeable and committed to providing exemplary customer service. Mobile Modular has expertise in project management and complex applications. Operating Structure – Part of the Company’s strategy for Mobile Modular is to create facilities and infrastructure capabilities that its competitors cannot easily duplicate. Mobile Modular achieves this by building regional sales and inventory centers designed to serve a broad geographic area and a large installed customer base under a single overhead structure, thereby reducing its cost per transaction. The Company’s regional facilities and related infrastructure enable Mobile Modular to maximize its modular inventory utilization through efficient and cost effective in-house repair, maintenance and refurbishment for quick redeployment of equipment to meet its customers’ needs. Asset Management – The Company believes Mobile Modular markets high quality, well-constructed and attractive modulars. Mobile Modular requires manufacturers to build to its specifications, which enables Mobile Modular to maintain a standardized quality fleet. In addition, through its ongoing repair, refurbishment and maintenance programs, the Company believes Mobile Modular’s buildings are the best maintained in the industry. The Company depreciates its modular buildings over an 18 year estimated useful life 5 to a 50% residual value. Older buildings continue to be productive primarily because of Mobile Modular’s focus on ongoing fleet maintenance. Also, as a result of Mobile Modular’s maintenance programs, when a modular unit is sold, a high percentage of the equipment’s capitalized cost is recovered. In addition, the fleet’s utilization is regionally optimized by managing inventory through estimates of market demand, fulfillment of current rental and sale order activity, modular returns and capital purchases. Customer Service - The Company believes the modular rental industry to be service intensive and locally based. The Company strives to provide excellent service by meeting its commitments to its customers, being proactive in resolving project issues and seeking to continuously improve the customers’ experience. Mobile Modular is committed to offering quick response to requests for information, providing experienced assistance, on time delivery and preventative maintenance of its units. Mobile Modular’s goal is to continuously improve its procedures, processes and computer systems to enhance internal operational efficiency. The Company believes this dedication to customer service results in high levels of customer loyalty and repeat business. Market Management estimates relocatable modular building rental is an industry that today has equipment on rent or available for rent in the U.S. with an aggregate original cost of over $5.0 billion. Mobile Modular’s largest market segment is for temporary classroom and other educational space needs of public and private schools, colleges and universities in California and Florida, and to a lesser extent in Texas, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C. Management believes the demand for rental classrooms is caused by shifting and fluctuating school populations, the limited state funds for new construction, the need for temporary classroom space during reconstruction of older schools, class size reduction and the phasing out of portable classrooms compliant with older building codes (see “Classroom Rentals and Sales to Public Schools (K-12)” below). Other customer applications include sales offices, construction field offices, health care facilities, church sanctuaries and child care facilities. Industrial, manufacturing, entertainment and utility companies, as well as governmental agencies commonly use large multi-modular complexes to serve their interim administrative and operational space needs. Modulars offer customers quick, cost-effective space solutions while conserving their capital. The Company’s corporate offices and regional sales and inventory center offices are housed in various sizes of modular units. Since most of Mobile Modular’s customer requirements are to fill temporary space needs, Mobile Modular’s marketing emphasis is on rentals rather than sales. Mobile Modular attracts customers through its website at www.mobilemodular.com, internet advertising and direct marketing. Customers are encouraged to visit a regional sales and inventory center to view different models on display and to see a regional office, which is a working example of a modular application. Because service is a major competitive factor in the rental of modulars, Mobile Modular offers quick response to requests for information, assistance in the choice of a suitable size and floor plan, in-house customization services, rapid delivery, timely installation and field service of its units. On Mobile Modular’s website, customers are able to view and select inventory for quotation and request in-field service. Rentals Rental periods range from one month to several years with a typical initial contract term between twelve and twenty-four months. In general, monthly rental rates are determined by a number of factors including length of term, market demand, product availability and product type. Upon expiration of the initial term, or any extensions, rental rates are reviewed, and when appropriate, are adjusted based on current market conditions. Most rental agreements are operating leases that provide no purchase options, and when a rental agreement does provide the customer with a purchase option, it is generally on terms management believes to be attractive to Mobile Modular. The customer is responsible for obtaining the necessary use permits and for the costs of insuring the unit, and is financially responsible for transporting the unit to the site, preparation of the site, installation of the unit, dismantle and return delivery of the unit to Mobile Modular, and certain costs for customization. Mobile Modular maintains the units in good working condition while on rent. Upon return, the units are inspected for damage and customers are billed for items considered beyond normal wear and tear. Generally, the units are then repaired for subsequent use. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred and can include floor repairs, roof maintenance, cleaning, painting and other cosmetic repairs. The costs of major refurbishment of equipment are capitalized to the extent the refurbishment significantly improves the quality and adds value or life to the equipment. At December 31, 2020, Mobile Modular owned 56,880 new or previously rented modulars and portable storage containers with an aggregate cost of $882.1 million including accessories, or an average cost per unit of $15,508. Utilization is calculated at the end of each month by dividing the cost of rental equipment on rent by the total cost of rental equipment, excluding new equipment inventory and accessory equipment. At December 31, 2020, fleet utilization was 76.0% and average fleet utilization during 2020 was 77.2%. The Mobile Modular segment includes the results of operations of Mobile Modular Portable Storage, which represented approximately 8% of the Company’s 2020 total revenues. 6 Sales In addition to operating its rental fleet, Mobile Modular sells modulars to customers. These sales typically arise out of its marketing efforts for the rental fleet and from existing equipment already on rent. Such sales can be of either new or used units from the rental fleet, which permits some turnover of older units. During 2020 Mobile Modular’s largest sale represented approximately 13% of Mobile Modular’s sales, 7% of the Company’s consolidated sales and 1% of the Company’s consolidated revenues. Mobile Modular typically provides limited 90-day warranties on used modulars and passes through the manufacturers’ one-year warranty on new units to its customers. Warranty costs have not been significant to Mobile Modular’s operations to date, and the Company attributes this to its commitment to high quality standards and regular maintenance programs. However, there can be no assurance that warranty costs will continue to be insignificant to Mobile Modular’s operations in the future. Enviroplex manufactures portable classrooms built to the requirements of the California Division of the State Architect (“DSA”) and sells directly to California public school districts and other educational institutions. Seasonality Typically, during each calendar year, our highest numbers of classrooms are shipped for rental and sale orders during the second and third quarters for delivery and installation prior to the start of the upcoming school year. The majority of classrooms shipped in the second and third quarters have rental start dates during the third quarter, thereby making the fourth quarter the first full quarter of rental revenues recognized for these transactions. Competition Competition in the rental and sale of relocatable modular buildings is intense. Some of our competitors in the modular building leasing industry, notably WillScot Corporation (which merged with Mobile Mini in July 2020), have a greater range of products and services, greater financial and marketing resources, larger customer bases, and greater name recognition than we have. In addition, a number of other smaller companies operate regionally throughout the country. Mobile Modular operates primarily in California, Texas, Florida, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, Maryland and Washington, D.C. Significant competitive factors in the rental business include availability, price, service, reliability, appearance and functionality of the product. Mobile Modular markets high quality, well-constructed and attractive modulars. Part of the Company’s strategy for modulars is to create facilities and infrastructure capabilities that its competitors cannot easily duplicate. The Company's facilities and related infrastructure enable it to modify modulars efficiently and cost effectively to meet its customers’ needs. Management's goal is to be more responsive at less expense. Management believes this strategy, together with its emphasis on prompt and efficient customer service, gives Mobile Modular a competitive advantage. Mobile Modular is determined to respond quickly to requests for information, and provide experienced assistance for the first-time user, rapid delivery and timely repair of its modular units. Mobile Modular’s already high level of efficiency and responsiveness continues to improve as the Company upgrades procedures, processes and computer systems that control its internal operations. The Company anticipates intense competition to continue and believes it must continue to improve its products and services to remain competitive in the market for modulars. Classroom Rentals and Sales to Public Schools (K-12) Mobile Modular and Enviroplex provide classroom and specialty space needs serving public and private schools, colleges and universities. Within the educational market, the rental (by Mobile Modular) and sale (by Enviroplex and Mobile Modular) of modulars to public school districts for use as portable classrooms, restroom buildings and administrative offices for kindergarten through grade twelve (K-12) are a significant portion of the Company’s revenues. Mobile Modular rents and sells classrooms in California, Florida, Texas, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C. Enviroplex sells classrooms in the California market. California is Mobile Modular’s largest educational market. Historically, demand in this market has been fueled by shifting and fluctuating student populations, insufficient funding for new school construction, class size reduction programs, modernization of aging school facilities and the phasing out of portable classrooms no longer compliant with current building codes. The following table shows the approximate percentages of the Company’s modular rental and sales revenues, and of its consolidated rental and sales revenues for the past five years, that rentals and sales to these schools constitute: 7 Rentals and Sales to Public Schools (K-12) as a Percentage of Total Rental and Sales Revenues Percentage of: 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 Modular Rental Revenues (Mobile Modular) 33% 32% 33% 33% 34% Modular Sales Revenues (Mobile Modular & Enviroplex) 48% 64% 70% 76% 67% Modular Rental and Sales Revenues (Mobile Modular & Enviroplex) 38% 42% 44% 47% 43% Consolidated Rental and Sales Revenues 1 23% 25% 24% 26% 23% 1 Consolidated Rental and Sales Revenue percentage is calculated by dividing Modular rental and sales revenues to public schools (K-12) by the Company’s consolidated rental and sales revenues. School Facility Funding Funding for public school facilities is derived from a variety of sources including the passage of both statewide and local facility bond measures, operating budgets, developer fees, various taxes including parcel and sales taxes levied to support school operating budgets, and lottery funds. There is no certainty on the timing of the bond sales and it could take additional years before projects funded by these bonds generate meaningful demand for relocatable classrooms. 8 ELECTRONIC TEST EQUIPMENT Description TRS-RenTelco rents and sells electronic test equipment nationally and internationally from two facilities located on the grounds of the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport in Grapevine, Texas (the “Dallas facility”) and Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Canada (the “Montreal facility”). TRS-RenTelco’s revenues are derived from the rental and sale of general purpose and communications test equipment to a broad range of companies, from Fortune 500 to middle and smaller market companies, in the aerospace, defense, communications, manufacturing and semiconductor industries. Electronic test equipment revenues are primarily affected by the business activity within these industries related to research and development, manufacturing, and communication infrastructure installation and maintenance. The Dallas facility, TRS-RenTelco’s primary operating location, houses the electronic test equipment inventory, sales engineers, calibration laboratories, and operations staff for U.S. and international business. The Montreal facility houses sales engineers and operations staff to serve the Canadian market. As of December 31, 2020, the original cost of electronic test equipment inventory was comprised of 78% general purpose electronic test equipment and 22% communications electronic test equipment. Engineers, technicians and scientists utilize general purpose electronic test equipment in developing products, controlling manufacturing processes, completing field service applications and evaluating the performance of their own electrical and electronic equipment. These instruments are rented primarily to aerospace, defense, electronics, industrial, research and semiconductor industries. To date, Keysight Technologies, Rhode & Schwarz and Tektronix, a division of Fortive Corporation, have manufactured the majority of TRS-RenTelco’s general purpose electronic test equipment with the remainder acquired from over 60 other manufacturers. Communications test equipment, including fiber optic test equipment, is utilized by technicians, engineers and installation contractors to evaluate voice, data and multimedia communications networks, to install fiber optic cabling, and in the development and manufacturing of transmission, network and wireless products. These instruments are rented primarily to manufacturers of communications equipment and products, electrical and communications installation contractors, field technicians, and service providers. To date, Anritsu, Viavi Solutions and Fluke Networks, a division of Fortive Corporation, have manufactured a significant portion of TRS-RenTelco’s communications test equipment, with the remainder acquired from over 40 other manufacturers. TRS-RenTelco’s general purpose test equipment rental inventory includes oscilloscopes, amplifiers, analyzers (spectrum, network and logic), signal source and power source test equipment. The communications test equipment rental inventory includes network and transmission test equipment for various fiber, copper and wireless networks. TRS-RenTelco occasionally rents electronic test equipment from other rental companies and re-rents the equipment to customers. Competitive Strengths Market Leadership - The Company believes that TRS-RenTelco is one of the largest electronic test equipment rental and leasing companies offering a broad and deep selection of general purpose and communications test equipment for rent in North America. Expertise - The Company believes that its knowledge of products, technology and applications expertise provides it with a competitive advantage over others in the industry. Customer requirements are supported by application engineers and technicians that are knowledgeable about the equipment’s uses to ensure the right equipment is selected to meet the customer’s needs. This knowledge can be attributed to the experience of TRS-RenTelco’s management, sales and operational teams. Operating Structure - TRS-RenTelco is supported by a centralized distribution and inventory center on the grounds of the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport in Texas. The Company believes that the centralization of servicing all customers in North America and internationally by TRS-RenTelco’s experienced logistics teams provides a competitive advantage by minimizing transaction costs and enabling TRS-RenTelco to ensure customer requirements are met. Asset Management - TRS-RenTelco’s rental equipment inventory is serviced by an ISO 9001-2015 registered and compliant calibration laboratory that repairs and calibrates equipment ensuring that off rent equipment is ready to ship immediately to meet customers’ needs. TRS-RenTelco’s team of technicians, product managers and sales personnel are continuously monitoring and analyzing the utilization of existing products, new technologies, general economic conditions and estimates of customer demand to ensure the right equipment is purchased and sold, at the right point in the equipment’s technology life cycle. The Company believes this enables it to maximize utilization of equipment and the cash flow generated by the rental and sales revenue of each model of equipment. TRS-RenTelco strives to maintain strong relationships with equipment manufacturers, which enables it to leverage those relationships to gain rental opportunities. Customer Service - The Company believes that its focus on providing excellent service to its customers provides a competitive advantage. TRS-RenTelco strives to provide exemplary service to fulfill its commitments to its customers. TRS-RenTelco prides itself 9 in providing solutions to meet customers’ needs by having equipment available and responding quickly and thoroughly to their requests. TRS- RenTelco’s sophisticated in-house laboratory ensures the equipment is fully functional and meets its customers’ delivery requirements. Service needs of TRS- RenTelco’s customers are supported 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by its customer care specialists. TRS- RenTelco’s goal is to provide service beyond its customers’ expectations, which, the Company believes, results in customer loyalty and repeat business. Market Electronic test equipment rental is a market which we estimate has equipment on rent worldwide or available for rent with an aggregate original cost in excess of $1 billion. There is a broad customer base for the rental of such instruments, including aerospace, communications, defense, electrical contractor, electronics, industrial, installer contractor, network systems and research companies. TRS-RenTelco markets its electronic test equipment throughout the United States, Canada, and, to a limited extent, other countries. TRS-RenTelco attracts customers through its outside sales force, website at www.TRSRenTelco.com, telemarketing program, trade show participation, paid internet search and electronic mail campaigns. A key part of the sales process is TRS-RenTelco’s knowledgeable inside sales engineering team that effectively matches test equipment solutions to meet specific customer’s requirements. The Company believes that customers rent electronic test equipment for many reasons. Customers frequently need equipment for short-term projects, to evaluate new products, and for backup to avoid costly downtime. Delivery times for the purchase of such equipment can be lengthy; thus, renting allows the customer to obtain the equipment expeditiously. The Company also believes that the relative certainty of rental costs can facilitate cost control and be useful in the bidding of and pass-through of contract costs. Finally, renting rather than purchasing may better satisfy the customer’s budgetary constraints. Rentals TRS-RenTelco rents electronic test equipment typically for rental periods of one to six months, although in some instances, rental terms can be up to a year or longer. Monthly rental rates typically are between 2% and 10% of the current manufacturers’ list price. TRS-RenTelco depreciates its equipment over 1 to 8 years with no residual value. At December 31, 2020, TRS-RenTelco had an electronic test equipment rental inventory including accessories with an aggregate cost of $333.0 million. Utilization is calculated each month by dividing the cost of the rental equipment on rent by the total cost of rental equipment, excluding accessory equipment. Utilization was 67.4% as of December 31, 2020 and averaged 66.2% during the year. Sales Profit from equipment sales is a material component of TRS-RenTelco’s overall annual earnings. Gross profit from sales of both used and new equipment over the last five years generally has ranged from approximately 20% to 24% of total annual gross profit for our electronics division. For 2020, gross profit on equipment sales was approximately 21% of total division gross profit. Equipment sales are driven by the turnover of older technology rental equipment, to maintain target utilization at a model number level, and new equipment sales opportunities. In 2020, approximately 19% of the electronic test equipment revenues were derived from sales. The largest electronic test equipment sale during 2020 represented 9% of electronic test equipment sales, 2% of the Company’s consolidated sales and less than 1% of consolidated revenues. There is intense competition in the sales of electronic test equipment from a world-wide network of test equipment brokers and resellers, legacy rental companies, and equipment manufacturers. We believe the annual world-wide sale of electronic test equipment is in excess of $8.0 billion per year. Seasonality Rental activity may decline in the fourth quarter month of December and the first quarter months of January and February. These months may have lower rental activity due to holiday closures, particularly by larger companies, inclement weather and its impact on various field related communications equipment rentals, and companies’ operational recovery from holiday closures which may impact the start-up of new projects coming online in the first quarter. These factors may impact the quarterly results of each year’s first and fourth quarter. Competition The electronic test equipment rental business is characterized by intense competition from several competitors, including Electro Rent Corporation, Continental Resources, and TestEquity, some of which may have access to greater financial and other resources than we do. TRS-RenTelco competes with these and other test equipment rental companies on the basis of product availability, price, service and reliability. Although no single competitor holds a dominant market share, we face intense competition from these established entities and new entrants in the market. Some of our competitors may offer similar equipment for lease, rental or sales at lower prices and may offer more extensive servicing, or financing options. 10 LIQUID AND SOLID CONTAINMENT TANKS AND BOXES Description Adler Tanks’ rental inventory is comprised of tanks and boxes used for various containment solutions to store hazardous and non-hazardous liquids and solids in applications such as: oil and gas exploration and field services, refinery, chemical and industrial plant maintenance, environmental remediation and field services, infrastructure building construction, marine services, pipeline construction and maintenance, tank terminals services, wastewater treatment, and waste management and landfill services.

Adler Tanks employees are knowledgeable about the operation of its rental equipment and customer applications. The Company believes that Adler Tanks provides a superior level of customer service due to its strong relationship building skills and the quality of its responsiveness. Asset Management – The Company believes that Adler Tanks markets a high quality, well-constructed and well-maintained rental product. The Company depreciates its tanks and boxes over a 20 year estimated useful life to 0% residual value. We believe that if maintained, older tanks and boxes will continue to produce similar rental rates as newer equipment. The fleet’s utilization is regionally optimized by understanding key vertical market customer demand, seasonality factors, competitor’s product availability and expected equipment returns. Market Liquid and solid containment equipment rental is a market in the U.S with a large and diverse number of market segments including oil and gas exploration and field services, refinery, chemical and industrial plant maintenance, environmental remediation and field services, infrastructure building construction, marine services, pipeline construction and maintenance, electrical grid transformer maintenance, tank terminals services, wastewater treatment, and waste management and landfill services. The tank and box rental products may be utilized throughout the U.S. and are not subject to any local or regional construction code or approval standards. Rentals Adler Tanks rents tanks and boxes typically for rental periods of one to six months, although in some instances, rental terms can be up to a year or longer. Monthly rental rates typically are between 2% and 10% of the equipment’s original acquisition cost. At December 31, 2020, Adler Tanks had rental equipment inventory including accessories with an aggregate cost of $315.7 million. Utilization is calculated each month by dividing the cost of the rental equipment on rent by the total cost of rental equipment, excluding accessory equipment. Utilization was 39.8% at December 31, 2020 and averaged 44.6% during the year. Seasonality Rental activity may decline in the fourth quarter month of December and the first quarter months of January and February. These months may have lower rental activity due to inclement weather in certain regions of the country impacting the industries that we serve. 11 Competition The liquid and solid containment rental industry is highly competitive including national, regional and local companies. Some of our national competitors, notably United Rentals (acquired BakerCorp in July 2018), Rain For Rent and Mobile Mini (merged with WillScot in July 2020), may be larger than we are and may have greater financial and other resources than we have. Some of our competitors also have longer operating histories and lower cost basis of rental equipment than we have. In addition, certain of our competitors are more geographically diverse than we are and have greater name recognition among customers than we do. As a result, our competitors that have these advantages may be better able to attract and retain customers and provide their products and services at lower rental rates. Adler Tanks competes with these companies based upon product availability, product quality, price, service and reliability. We may encounter increased competition in the markets that we serve from existing competitors or from new market entrants in the future.

Average utilization is calculated using the average cost of equipment for the year. 2 Average rental equipment, at cost for modulars and tanks and boxes excludes new equipment inventory and accessory equipment. 3 Average rental equipment, at cost, for electronics excludes accessory equipment. 4 Annual yield on average rental equipment, at cost is calculated by dividing the total annual rental revenues by the average rental equipment, at cost. 14 ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the following discussion of various risks and uncertainties. We believe these risk factors are the most relevant to our business and could cause our results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made by us. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be seriously harmed if any of these risks or uncertainties actually occur or materialize. In that event, the market price for our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. RISKS RELATED TO OUR STRATEGY AND OPERATION: Our future operating results may fluctuate, fail to match past performance or fail to meet expectations, which may result in a decrease in our stock price. Our operating results may fluctuate in the future, may fail to match our past performance or fail to meet the expectations of analysts and investors. Our results and related ratios, such as gross margin, operating income percentage and effective tax rate may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control including but not limited to: • general economic conditions in the geographies and industries where we rent and sell our products; • legislative and educational policies where we rent and sell our products; • the budgetary constraints of our customers; • seasonality of our rental businesses and our end-markets; • success of our strategic growth initiatives; • costs associated with the launching or integration of new or acquired businesses; • the timing and type of equipment purchases, rentals and sales; • the nature and duration of the equipment needs of our customers; • the timing of new product introductions by us, our suppliers and our competitors; • the volume, timing and mix of maintenance and repair work on our rental equipment; • our equipment mix, availability, utilization and pricing; • the mix, by state and country, of our revenues, personnel and assets; • rental equipment impairment from excess, obsolete or damaged equipment; • movements in interest rates or tax rates; • changes in, and application of, accounting rules; • changes in the regulations applicable to us; and • litigation matters. As a result of these factors, our historical financial results are not necessarily indicative of our future results or stock price. Our stock price has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate in the future, which may result in a decline in the value of your investment in our common stock. The market price of our common stock fluctuates on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and is likely to be affected by a number of factors including but not limited to: • our operating performance and the performance of our competitors, and in particular any variations in our operating results or dividend rate from our stated guidance or from investors’ expectations; • any changes in general conditions in the global economy, the industries in which we operate or the global financial markets; • investors’ reaction to our press releases, public announcements or filings with the SEC; • the stock price performance of our competitors or other comparable companies; • any changes in research analysts’ coverage, recommendations or earnings estimates for us or for the stocks of other companies in our industry; 15 • any sales of common stock by our directors, executive officers and our other large shareholders, particularly in light of the limited trading volume of our stock; • any merger and acquisition activity that involves us or our competitors; and • other announcements or developments affecting us, our industry, customers, suppliers or competitors. In addition, in recent years the U.S. stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations are often unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. Additionally, the most recent global credit crisis adversely affected the prices of most publicly traded stocks as many stockholders became more willing to divest their stock holdings at lower values to increase their cash flow and reduce exposure to such fluctuations. These broad market fluctuations and any other negative economic trends may cause declines in the market price of our common stock and may be based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our Company or its performance, and these fluctuations and trends could materially reduce our stock price. The impact of COVID-19 on our operations, and the operations of our customers, suppliers and logistics providers, may harm our business. We continue to monitor the potential impact of COVID-19 outbreak around the globe. This includes evaluating the impact on our customers, suppliers, and logistics providers as well as evaluating governmental actions being taken to curtail the spread of the virus. Significant uncertainty continues to exist concerning the magnitude of the impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. While the Company's operating segments and branch locations currently continue to operate, the Company’s results of operations may be negatively impacted by project delays; early returns of equipment currently on rent with customers; overall decreased customer demand for new rental orders, rental related services and sales of new and used rental equipment; and payment delay, or non-payment, by customers who are significantly impacted by COVID-19 . Our ability to retain our executive management and to recruit, retain and motivate key qualified employees is critical to the success of our business. If we cannot successfully recruit and retain qualified personnel, our operating results and stock price may suffer. We believe that our success is directly linked to the competent people in our organization, including our executive officers, senior managers and other key personnel, and in particular, Joe Hanna, our Chief Executive Officer. Personnel turnover can be costly and could materially and adversely impact our operating results and can potentially jeopardize the success of our current strategic initiatives. We need to attract and retain highly qualified personnel to replace personnel when turnover occurs, as well as add to our staff levels as growth occurs. Our business and stock price likely will suffer if we are unable to fill, or experience delays in filling open positions, or fail to retain key personnel. Failure by third parties to manufacture and deliver our products to our specifications or on a timely basis may harm our reputation and financial condition. We depend on third parties to manufacture our products even though we are able to purchase products from a variety of third-party suppliers. In the future, we may be limited as to the number of third-party suppliers for some of our products. Although in general we make advance purchases of some products to help ensure an adequate supply, currently we do not have any long-term purchase contracts with any third-party supplier. We may experience supply problems as a result of financial or operating difficulties or failure of our suppliers, or shortages and discontinuations resulting from product obsolescence or other shortages or allocations by our suppliers. Unfavorable economic conditions may also adversely affect our suppliers or the terms on which we purchase products. In the future, we may not be able to negotiate arrangements with third parties to secure products that we require in sufficient quantities or on reasonable terms. If we cannot negotiate arrangements with third parties to produce our products or if the third parties fail to produce our products to our specifications or in a timely manner, our reputation and financial condition could be harmed. A breach of our information technology systems could subject us to liability, reputational damage or interrupt the operation of our business. We rely upon our information technology systems and infrastructure for our business. We could experience theft of confidential information or reputational damage from industrial espionage attacks, malware or other cyber-attacks, which may compromise our system infrastructure or lead to data leakage, either internally or at our third-party providers. Similarly, data privacy breaches by those who access our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to us, our employees, customers or other business partners, may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. Cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and have become increasingly difficult to detect. There can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our data and information technology systems will prevent breaches in our systems (or that of our third-party providers) that could adversely affect our business and result in financial and reputational harm to us, theft of trade secrets 16 and other proprietary information, legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties. Disruptions in our information technology systems or failure to protect these systems against security breaches could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Additionally, if these systems fail, become unavailable for any period of time or are not upgraded, this could limit our ability to effectively monitor and control our operations and adversely affect our operations. Our information technology systems facilitate our ability to transact business, monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions. Any disruption in our information technology systems or the failure of these systems to operate as expected could, depending on the magnitude of the problem, adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively transact business, monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions in a timely manner. In addition, because of recent advances in technology and well-known efforts on the part of computer hackers and cyber-terrorists to breach data security of companies, we face risks associated with potential failure to adequately protect critical corporate, customer and employee data, which, if released, could adversely impact our customer relationships, our reputation, and even violate privacy laws. As part of our business, we develop, receive and retain confidential data about our company and our customers. Further, the delay or failure to implement information system upgrades and new systems effectively could disrupt our business, distract management’s focus and attention from our business operations and growth initiatives, and increase our implementation and operating costs, any of which could negatively impact our operations and operating results. We have engaged in acquisitions and may engage in future acquisitions that could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and business. Previously, we acquired Technology Rentals & Services (“TRS”), an electronic test equipment rental business and Adler Tanks, a liquid and solid containment rental business, as well as several smaller acquisitions that were integrated into our current operating segments. We anticipate that we will continue to consider acquisitions in the future that meet our strategic growth plans. We are unable to predict whether or when any prospective acquisition will be completed. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following: • difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired companies; • diversion of management’s attention from normal daily operations of our business; • difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets may have stronger market positions; • difficulties in complying with regulations applicable to any acquired business, such as environmental regulations, and managing risks related to an acquired business; • timely completion of necessary financing and required amendments, if any, to existing agreements; • an inability to implement uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies; • undiscovered and unknown problems, defects, damaged assets liabilities, or other issues related to any acquisition that become known to us only after the acquisition; • negative reactions from our customers to an acquisition; • disruptions among employees related to any acquisition which may erode employee morale; • loss of key employees, including costly litigation resulting from the termination of those employees; • an inability to realize cost efficiencies or synergies that we may anticipate when selecting acquisition candidates; • recording of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to future impairment testing and potential periodic impairment charges; • incurring amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets; and • becoming subject to litigation. 17 Acquisitions are inherently risky, and no assurance can be given that our future acquisitions will be successful or will not adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. The success of our acquisition strategy depends upon our ability to successfully complete acquisitions and integrate any businesses that we acquire into our existing business. The difficulties of integration could be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically dispersed organizations; maintaining acceptable standards, controls, procedures and policies; integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds; combining different corporate cultures; and the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management and other personnel. In addition, if we consummate one or more significant future acquisitions in which the consideration consists of stock or other securities, our existing shareholders’ ownership could be diluted significantly. If we were to proceed with one or more significant future acquisitions in which the consideration included cash, we could be required to use, to the extent available, a substantial portion of our Credit Facility. If we increase the amount borrowed against our available credit line, we would increase the risk of breaching the covenants under our credit facilities with our lenders. In addition, it would limit our ability to make other investments, or we may be required to seek additional debt or equity financing. Any of these items could adversely affect our results of operations. If we determine that our goodwill and intangible assets have become impaired, we may incur impairment charges, which would negatively impact our operating results. At December 31, 2020, we had $35.3 million of goodwill and intangible assets, net, on our consolidated balance sheets. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, we assess potential impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets at least annually, as well as on an interim basis to the extent that factors or indicators become apparent that could reduce the fair value of any of our businesses below book value. Impairment may result from significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired asset, negative industry or economic trends and significant underperformance relative to historic or projected operating results. Our rental equipment is subject to residual value risk upon disposition, and may not sell at the prices or in the quantities we expect. The market value of any given piece of rental equipment could be less than its depreciated value at the time it is sold. The market value of used rental equipment depends on several factors, including: • the market price for new equipment of a like kind; • the age of the equipment at the time it is sold, as well as wear and tear on the equipment relative to its age; • the supply of used equipment on the market; • technological advances relating to the equipment; • worldwide and domestic demand for used equipment; and • general economic conditions. We include in income from operations the difference between the sales price and the depreciated value of an item of equipment sold. Changes in our assumptions regarding depreciation could change our depreciation expense, as well as the gain or loss realized upon disposal of equipment. Sales of our used rental equipment at prices that fall significantly below our projections or in lesser quantities than we anticipate will have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. If we do not effectively manage our credit risk, collect on our accounts receivable or recover our rental equipment from our customers’ sites, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We generally rent and sell to customers on 30 day payment terms, individually perform credit evaluation procedures on our customers for each transaction and require security deposits or other forms of security from our customers when a significant credit risk is identified. Historically, accounts receivable write-offs and write-offs related to equipment not returned by customers have not been significant and have averaged less than 1% of total revenues over the last five years. If economic conditions deteriorate, we may see an increase in bad debt relative to historical levels, which may materially and adversely affect our operations. Business segments that experience significant market disruptions or declines may experience increased customer credit risk and higher bad debt expense. Failure to manage our credit risk and receive timely payments on our customer accounts receivable may result in write-offs and/or loss of equipment, particularly electronic test equipment. If we are not able to effectively manage credit risk issues, or if a large number of our customers should have financial difficulties at the same time, our receivables and equipment losses could increase above historical levels. If this should occur, our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. 18 Effective management of our rental assets is vital to our business. If we are not successful in these efforts, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Our modular, electronics and liquid and solid containment rental products have long useful lives and managing those assets is a critical element to each of our rental businesses. Generally, we design units and find manufacturers to build them to our specifications for our modular and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes. Modular asset management requires designing and building the product for a long life that anticipates the needs of our customers, including anticipating potential changes in legislation, regulations, building codes and local permitting in the various markets in which the Company operates. Electronic test equipment asset management requires understanding, selecting and investing in equipment technologies that support market demand, including anticipating technological advances and changes in manufacturers’ selling prices. Liquid and solid containment asset management requires designing and building the product for a long life, using quality components and repairing and maintaining the products to prevent leaks. For each of our modular, electronic test equipment and liquid and solid containment assets, we must successfully maintain and repair this equipment cost-effectively to maximize the useful life of the products and the level of proceeds from the sale of such products. To the extent that we are unable to do so, our result of operations could be materially adversely affected. The nature of our businesses, including the ownership of industrial property, exposes us to the risk of litigation and liability under environmental, health and safety and products liability laws. Violations of environmental or health and safety related laws or associated liability could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to national, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, solid and liquid waste and hazardous substances handling, storage and disposal and employee health and safety. These laws and regulations are complex and frequently change. We could incur unexpected costs, penalties and other civil and criminal liability if we fail to comply with applicable environmental or health and safety laws. We also could incur costs or liabilities related to waste disposal or remediating soil or groundwater contamination at our properties, at our customers’ properties or at third party landfill and disposal sites. These liabilities can be imposed on the parties generating, transporting or disposing of such substances or on the owner or operator of any affected property, often without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous substances. Several aspects of our businesses involve risks of environmental and health and safety liability. For example, our operations involve the use of petroleum products, solvents and other hazardous substances in the construction and maintaining of modular buildings and for fueling and maintaining our delivery trucks and vehicles. We also own, transport and rent tanks and boxes in which waste materials are placed by our customers. The historical operations at some of our previously or currently owned or leased and newly acquired or leased properties may have resulted in undiscovered soil or groundwater contamination or historical non-compliance by third parties for which we could be held liable. Future events, such as changes in existing laws or policies or their enforcement, or the discovery of currently unknown contamination or non-compliance, may also give rise to liabilities or other claims based on these operations that may be material. In addition, compliance with future environmental or health and safety laws and regulations may require significant capital or operational expenditures or changes to our operations. Accordingly, in addition to potential penalties for non-compliance, we may become liable, either contractually or by operation of law, for investigation, remediation and monitoring costs even if the contaminated property is not presently owned or operated by us, or if the contamination was caused by third parties during or prior to our ownership or operation of the property. In addition, certain parties may be held liable for more than their “fair” share of environmental investigation and cleanup costs. Contamination and exposure to hazardous substances or other contaminants such as mold can also result in claims for remediation or damages, including personal injury, property damage, and natural resources damage claims. Although expenses related to environmental compliance, health and safety issues, and related matters have not been material to date, we cannot assure that we will not have to make significant expenditures in the future in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Violations of environmental or health and safety related laws or associated liability could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In general, litigation in the industries in which we operate, including class actions that seek substantial damages, arises with increasing frequency. Enforcement of environmental and health and safety requirements is also frequent. Such proceedings are invariably expensive, regardless of the merit of the plaintiffs’ or prosecutors’ claims. We may be named as a defendant in the future, and there can be no assurance, irrespective of the merit of such future actions, that we will not be required to make substantial settlement payments in the future. Further, a significant portion of our business is conducted in California which is one of the most highly regulated and litigious states in the country. Therefore, our potential exposure to losses and expenses due to new laws, regulations or litigation may be greater than companies with a less significant California presence. The nature of our business also subjects us to property damage and product liability claims, especially in connection with our modular buildings and tank and box rental businesses. Although we maintain liability coverage that we believe is commercially reasonable, an unusually large property damage or product liability claim or a series of claims could exceed our insurance coverage or result in damage to our reputation. 19 Our routine business activities expose us to risk of litigation from employees, vendors and other third parties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We may be subject to claims arising from disputes with employees, vendors and other third parties in the normal course of our business; these risks may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. If the plaintiffs in any suits against us were to successfully prosecute their claims, or if we were to settle any such suits by making significant payments to the plaintiffs, our operating results and financial condition would be harmed. Even if the outcome of a claim proves favorable to us, litigation can be time consuming and costly and may divert management resources. In addition, our organizational documents require us to indemnify our senior executives to the maximum extent permitted by California law. We maintain directors’ and officers’ liability insurance that we believe is commercially reasonable in connection with such obligations, but if our senior executives were named in any lawsuit, our indemnification obligations could magnify the costs of these suits and/or exceed the coverage of such policies. If we suffer loss to our facilities, equipment or distribution system due to catastrophe, our insurance policies could be inadequate or depleted, our operations could be seriously harmed, which could negatively affect our operating results. Our facilities, rental equipment and distribution systems may be subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, hurricane, earthquake, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters. In particular, our headquarters, three operating facilities, and certain of our rental equipment are located in areas of California, with above average seismic activity and could be subject to catastrophic loss caused by an earthquake. Our rental equipment and facilities in Texas, Louisiana, Florida, North Carolina and Georgia are located in areas subject to hurricanes and other tropical storms. In addition to customers’ insurance on rented equipment, we carry property insurance on our rental equipment in inventory and operating facilities as well as business interruption insurance. We believe our insurance policies have adequate limits and deductibles to mitigate the potential loss exposure of our business. We do not maintain financial reserves for policy deductibles and our insurance policies contain exclusions that are customary for our industry, including exclusions for earthquakes, flood and terrorism. If any of our facilities or a significant amount of our rental equipment were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay orders, shipments and revenue recognition and result in expenses to repair or replace the damaged rental equipment and facility not covered by insurance, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. INTEREST RATE AND INDEBTEDNESS RISKS: Our debt instruments contain covenants that restrict or prohibit our ability to enter into a variety of transactions and may limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs. If we have an event of default under these instruments, our indebtedness could be accelerated and we may not be able to refinance such indebtedness or make the required accelerated payments. The agreements governing our Series B and Series C Senior Notes (as defined and more fully described under the heading “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources”) and our Credit Facility contain various covenants that limit our discretion in operating our business. In particular, we are limited in our ability to merge, consolidate, reorganize or transfer substantially all of our assets, make investments, pay dividends or distributions, redeem or repurchase stock, change the nature of our business, enter into transactions with affiliates, incur indebtedness and create liens on our assets to secure debt. In addition, we are required to meet certain financial covenants under these instruments. These restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financing, make strategic acquisitions or needed capital expenditures, withstand economic downturns in our business or the economy in general, conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise. A failure to comply with the restrictions contained in these agreements could lead to an event of default, which could result in an acceleration of our indebtedness. In the event of an acceleration, we may not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to refinance our indebtedness or make any required accelerated payments. If we default on our indebtedness, our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. 20 The majority of our indebtedness is subject to variable interest rates, which makes us vulnerable to increases in interest rates, which could negatively affect our net income. Our indebtedness exposes us to interest rate increases because the majority of our indebtedness is subject to variable rates. At present, we do not have any derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps or hedges to mitigate interest rate variability. The interest rates under our credit facilities are reset at varying periods. These interest rate adjustments could cause periodic fluctuations in our operating results and cash flows. Our annual debt service obligations increase by approximately $1.2 million per year for each 1% increase in the average interest rate we pay based on the $122.8 million balance of variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2020. If interest rates rise in the future, and, particularly if they rise significantly, interest expense will increase and our net income will be negatively affected. GENERAL RISKS: Our effective tax rate may change and become less predictable as our business expands, or as a result of federal and state tax law changes, making our future earnings less predictable. We continue to consider expansion opportunities domestically and internationally for our rental businesses. Since the Company’s effective tax rate depends on business levels, personnel and assets located in various jurisdictions, further expansion into new markets or acquisitions may change the effective tax rate in the future and may make it, and consequently our earnings, less predictable going forward. In addition, the enactment of future tax law changes by federal and state taxing authorities may impact the Company’s current period tax provision and its deferred tax liabilities. Changes in financial accounting standards may cause lower than expected operating results and affect our reported results of operations. Changes in accounting standards and their application may have a significant effect on our reported results on a going-forward basis and may also affect the recording and disclosure of previously reported transactions. New accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred in the past and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business. SPECIFIC RISKS RELATED TO OUR RELOCATABLE MODULAR BUILDINGS BUSINESS SEGMENT: Significant reductions of, or delays in, funding to public schools have caused the demand and pricing for our modular classroom units to decline, which has in the past caused, and may cause in the future, a reduction in our revenues and profitability. Rentals and sales of modular buildings to public school districts for use as classrooms, restroom buildings, and administrative offices for K-12 represent a significant portion of Mobile Modular’s rental and sales revenues. Funding for public school facilities is derived from a variety of sources including the passage of both statewide and local facility bond measures, developer fees and various taxes levied to support school operating budgets. Many of these funding sources are subject to financial and political considerations, which vary from district to district and are not tied to demand. Historically, we have benefited from the passage of statewide and local facility bond measures and believe these are essential to our business. The state of California is our largest market for classroom rentals. The strength of this market depends heavily on public funding from voter passage of both state and local facility bond measures, and the ability of the state to sell such bonds in the public market. A lack of passage of state and local facility bond measures, or the inability to sell bonds in the public markets in the future could reduce our revenues and operating income, and consequently have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition. Furthermore, even if voters have approved facility bond measures and the state has raised bond funds, there is no guarantee that individual school projects will be funded in a timely manner. As a consequence of the most recent economic recession, many states and local governments experienced large budget deficits resulting in severe budgetary constraints among public school districts. To the extent public school districts’ funding is reduced for the rental and purchase of modular buildings, our business could be harmed and our results of operations negatively impacted. We believe that interruptions or delays in the passage of facility bond measures or completion of state budgets, an insufficient amount of state funding, a significant reduction of funding to public schools, or changes negatively impacting enrollment may reduce the rental and sale demand for our educational products. Any reductions in funding available to the school districts from the states in which we do business may cause school districts to experience budget shortfalls and to reduce their demand for our products despite growing student populations, class size reduction initiatives and modernization and reconstruction project needs, which could reduce our revenues and operating income and consequently have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition. 21 Public policies that create demand for our products and services may change, resulting in decreased demand for or the pricing of our products and services, which could negatively affect our revenues and operating income. Various states that we operate enacted laws and constitutional amendments to provide funding for school districts to limit the number of students that may be grouped in a single classroom. School districts with class sizes in excess of state limits have been and continue to be a significant source of our demand for modular classrooms. In California, efforts to address aging infrastructure and deferred maintenance have resulted in modernization and reconstruction projects by public school districts including seismic retrofitting, asbestos abatement and various building repairs and upgrades, which has been another source of demand for our modular classrooms. The most recent economic recession caused state and local budget shortfalls, which reduced school districts’ funding and their ability to comply with state class size reduction requirements. If educational priorities and policies shift away from class-size reduction or modernization and reconstruction projects, demand and pricing for our products and services may decline, not grow as quickly as, or not reach the levels that we anticipate. Significant equipment returns may result in lower utilization until equipment can be redeployed or sold, which may cause rental rates to decline and negatively affect our revenues and operating income. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could harm our business and financial condition, resulting in lower operating results and cash flows. Similar to conventionally constructed buildings, the modular building industry, including the manufacturers and lessors of portable classrooms, are subject to regulations by multiple governmental agencies at the federal, state and local level relating to environmental, zoning, health, safety, energy efficiency, labor and transportation matters, among other matters. Failure to comply with these laws or regulations could impact our business or harm our reputation and result in higher capital or operating expenditures or the imposition of penalties or restrictions on our operations. As with conventional construction, typically new codes and regulations are not retroactively applied. Nonetheless, new governmental regulations in these or other areas may increase our acquisition cost of new rental equipment, limit the use of or make obsolete some of our existing equipment, or increase our costs of rental operations. Building codes are generally reviewed every three years. All aspects of a given code are subject to change including, but not limited to, such items as structural specifications for earthquake safety, energy efficiency and environmental standards, fire and life safety, transportation, lighting and noise limits. Compliance with building codes and regulations entails a certain amount of risk as state and local government authorities do not necessarily interpret building codes and regulations in a consistent manner, particularly where applicable regulations may be unclear and subject to interpretation. These regulations often provide broad discretion to governmental authorities that oversee these matters, which can result in unanticipated delays or increases in the cost of compliance in particular markets. The construction and modular industries have developed many “best practices” which are constantly evolving. Some of our peers and competitors may adopt practices that are more or less stringent than the Company’s. When, and if, regulatory standards are clarified, the effect of the clarification may be to impose rules on our business and practices retroactively, at which time, we may not be in compliance with such regulations and we may be required to incur costly remediation. If we are unable to pass these increased costs on to our customers, our profitability, operating cash flows and financial condition could be negatively impacted. Expansions of our modular operations into new markets may negatively affect our operating results. In the past we have expanded our modular operations into new geographies and states. There are risks inherent in the undertaking of such expansion, including the risk of revenue from the business in any new markets not meeting our expectations, higher than expected costs in entering these new markets, risk associated with compliance with applicable state and local laws and regulations, response by competitors and unanticipated consequences of expansion. In addition, expansion into new markets may be affected by local economic and market conditions. Expansion of our operations into new markets will require a significant amount of attention from our management, a commitment of financial resources and will require us to add qualified management in these markets, which may negatively impact our operating results. We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts. These laws and regulations make these government contracts more favorable to government entities than other third parties and any changes in these laws and regulations, or our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business. We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. For example, many government contracts contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts such as clauses that allow government entities not to perform on contractual obligations in the case of a lack of fiscal funding. Also, in the educational markets we serve, we are able to utilize “piggyback” contracts in marketing our products and services 22 and ultimately to book business. The term “piggyback” contract refers to contracts for portable classrooms or other products entered into by public school districts following a formal bid process that allows for the use of the same contract terms and conditions with the successful vendor by other public school districts. As a result, “piggyback” contracts allow us to more readily book orders from our government customers, primarily public school districts, and to reduce the administrative expense associated with booking these orders. The governmental statutes and regulations that allow for use of “piggyback” contracts are subject to change or elimination in their entirety. A change in the manner of use or the elimination of “piggyback” contracts would likely negatively impact our ability to book new business from these government customers and could cause our administrative expenses related to processing these orders to increase significantly. In addition, any failure to comply with these laws and regulations might result in administrative penalties or even in the suspension of these contracts and as a result, the loss of the related revenues which would harm our business and results from operations. Seasonality of our educational business may have adverse consequences for our business. A significant portion of the modular sale and rental revenues is derived from the educational market. Typically, during each calendar year, our highest numbers of classrooms are shipped for rental and sale orders during the second and third quarters for delivery and installation prior to the start of the upcoming school year. The majority of classrooms shipped in the second and third quarters have rental start dates during the third quarter, thereby making the fourth quarter the first full quarter of rental revenues recognized for these transactions. Although this is the historical seasonality of our business, it is subject to change or may not meet our expectations, which may have adverse consequences for our business. We face strong competition in our modular building markets and we may not be able to effectively compete. The modular building leasing industry is highly competitive in our states of operation and we expect it to remain so. The competitive market in which we operate may prevent us from raising rental fees or sales prices to pass any increased costs on to our customers. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including equipment availability, quality, price, service, reliability, appearance, functionality and delivery terms. We may experience pricing pressures in our areas of operation in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing prices. Some of our competitors in the modular building leasing industry, notably WillScot Corporation, have a greater range of products and services, greater financial and marketing resources, larger customer bases, and greater name recognition than we have. In August 2018, WillScot Corporation completed the acquisition of Modspace in August, 2018 and Mobile Mini in July, 2020. These combined competitors may be better able to respond to changes in the relocatable modular building market, to finance acquisitions, to fund internal growth and to compete for market share, any of which could harm our business. We may not be able to quickly redeploy modular units returning from leases, which could negatively affect our financial performance and our ability to expand, or utilize, our rental fleet. As of December 31, 2020, 65% of our modular portfolio had equipment on rent for periods exceeding the original committed term. Generally, when a customer continues to rent the modular units beyond the contractual term, the equipment rents on a month-to-month basis. If a significant number of our rented modular units were returned during a short period of time, particularly those units that are rented on a month-to-month basis, a large supply of units would need to be remarketed. Our failure to effectively remarket a large influx of units returning from leases could negatively affect our financial performance and our ability to continue expanding our rental fleet. In addition, if returned units stay off rent for an extended period of time, we may incur additional costs to securely store and maintain them. Significant increases in raw material and labor costs could increase our acquisition cost of new modular rental units and repair and maintenance costs of our fleet, which would increase our operating costs and harm our profitability. We incur labor costs and purchase raw materials, including lumber, siding and roofing and other products to perform periodic repairs, modifications and refurbishments to maintain physical conditions of our modular units. The volume, timing and mix of maintenance and repair work on our rental equipment may vary quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. Generally, increases in labor and raw material costs will also increase the acquisition cost of new modular units and increase the repair and maintenance costs of our fleet. We also maintain a fleet of service trucks and use subcontractor companies for the delivery, set-up, return delivery and dismantle of modulars for our customers. We rely on our subcontractor service companies to meet customer demands for timely shipment and return, and the loss or inadequate number of subcontractor service companies may cause prices to increase, while negatively impacting our reputation and operating performance. During periods of rising prices for labor, raw materials or fuel, and in particular, when the prices increase rapidly or to levels significantly higher than normal, we may incur significant increases in our acquisition costs for new modular units and incur higher operating costs that we may not be able to recoup from our customers, which would reduce our profitability. 23 Failure by third parties to manufacture our products timely or properly may harm our reputation and financial condition. We are dependent on third parties to manufacture our products even though we are able to purchase products from a variety of third-party suppliers. Mobile Modular purchases new modulars from various manufacturers who build to Mobile Modular’s design specifications. With the exception of Enviroplex, none of the principal suppliers are affiliated with the Company. During 2020, Mobile Modular purchased 45% of its modular product from one manufacturer. The Company believes that the loss of any of its primary manufacturers of modulars could have an adverse effect on its operations since Mobile Modular could experience higher prices and longer delivery lead times for modular product until other manufacturers were able to increase their production capacity. Failure to properly design, manufacture, repair and maintain the modular product may result in impairment charges, potential litigation and reduction of our operating results and cash flows. We estimate the useful life of the modular product to be 18 years with a residual value of 50%. However, proper design, manufacture, repairs and maintenance of the modular product during our ownership is required for the product to reach the estimated useful life of 18 years with a residual value of 50%. If we do not appropriately manage the design, manufacture, repair and maintenance of our modular product, or otherwise delay or defer such repair or maintenance, we may be required to incur impairment charges for equipment that is beyond economic repair costs or incur significant capital expenditures to acquire new modular product to serve demand. In addition, such failures may result in personal injury or property damage claims, including claims based on presence of mold, and termination of leases or contracts by customers. Costs of contract performance, potential litigation, and profits lost from termination could accordingly reduce our future operating results and cash flows. Our warranty costs may increase and warranty claims could damage our reputation and negatively impact our revenues and operating income. Sales of new relocatable modular buildings not manufactured by us are typically covered by warranties provided by the manufacturer of the products sold. We provide ninety-day warranties on certain modular sales of used rental units and one-year warranties on equipment manufactured by our Enviroplex subsidiary. Historically, our warranty costs have not been significant, and we monitor the quality of our products closely. If a defect were to arise in the installation of our equipment at the customer’s facilities or in the equipment acquired from our suppliers or by our Enviroplex subsidiary, we may experience increased warranty claims. Such claims could disrupt our sales operations, damage our reputation and require costly repairs or other remedies, negatively impacting revenues and operating income. SPECIFIC RISKS RELATED TO OUR ELECTRONIC TEST EQUIPMENT BUSINESS SEGMENT: Market risk and cyclical downturns in the industries using test equipment may result in periods of low demand for our product resulting in excess inventory, impairment charges and reduction of our operating results and cash flows. TRS-RenTelco’s revenues are derived from the rental and sale of general purpose and communications test equipment to a broad range of companies, from Fortune 500 to middle and smaller market companies, in the aerospace, defense, communications, manufacturing and semiconductor industries. Electronic test equipment rental and sales revenues are primarily affected by the business activity within these industries related to research and development, manufacturing, and communication infrastructure installation and maintenance. Historically, these industries have been cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns, which can have a material adverse impact on the industry’s demand for equipment, including our rental electronic test equipment. In addition, the severity and length of any downturn in an industry may also affect overall access to capital, which could adversely affect our customers and result in excess inventory and impairment charges. During periods of reduced and declining demand for test equipment, we are exposed to additional receivable risk from non-payment and may need to rapidly align our cost structure with prevailing market conditions, which may negatively impact our operating results and cash flows. Seasonality of our electronic test equipment business may impact quarterly results. Generally, rental activity declines in the fourth quarter month of December and the first quarter months of January and February. These months may have lower rental activity due to holiday closures, particularly by larger companies, inclement weather and its impact on various field related communications equipment rentals, and companies’ operational recovery from holiday closures which may impact the start-up of new projects coming online in the first quarter. These seasonal factors historically have impacted quarterly results in each year’s first and fourth quarter, but we are unable to predict how such factors may impact future periods. Our rental test equipment may become obsolete or may no longer be supported by a manufacturer, which could result in an impairment charge. Electronic test equipment is characterized by changing technology and evolving industry standards that may render our existing equipment obsolete through new product introductions, or enhancements, before the end of its anticipated useful life, causing us to incur 24 impairment charges. We must anticipate and keep pace with the introduction of new hardware, software and networking technologies and acquire equipment that will be marketable to our current and prospective customers. Additionally, some manufacturers of our equipment may be acquired or cease to exist, resulting in a future lack of support for equipment purchased from those manufacturers. This could result in the remaining useful life becoming shorter, causing us to incur an impairment charge. We monitor our manufacturers’ capacity to support their products and the introduction of new technologies, and we acquire equipment that will be marketable to our current and prospective customers. However, any prolonged economic downturn could result in unexpected bankruptcies or reduced support from our manufacturers. Failure to properly select, manage and respond to the technological needs of our customers and changes to our products through their technology life cycle may cause certain electronic test equipment to become obsolete, resulting in impairment charges, which may negatively impact operating results and cash flows. If we do not effectively compete in the rental equipment market, our operating results will be materially and adversely affected. The electronic test equipment rental business is characterized by intense competition from several competitors, including Electro Rent Corporation, Continental Resources and TestEquity, some of which may have access to greater financial and other resources than we do. Although no single competitor holds a dominant market share, we face competition from these established entities and new entrants in the market. We believe that we anticipate and keep pace with the introduction of new products and acquire equipment that will be marketable to our current and prospective customers. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including product availability, price, service and reliability. Some of our competitors may offer similar equipment for lease, rental or sale at lower prices and may offer more extensive servicing, or financing options. Failure to adequately forecast the adoption of, and demand for, new or existing products may cause us not to meet our customers’ equipment requirements and may materially and adversely affect our operating results. If we are not able to obtain equipment at favorable rates, there could be a material adverse effect on our operating results and reputation. The majority of our rental equipment portfolio is comprised of general purpose test and measurement instruments purchased from leading manufacturers such as Keysight Technologies, Rhode & Schwarz and Tektronix, a division of Fortive Corporation. We depend on purchasing equipment from these manufacturers and suppliers for use as our rental equipment. If, in the future, we are not able to purchase necessary equipment from one or more of these suppliers on favorable terms, we may not be able to meet our customers’ demands in a timely manner or for a rental rate that generates a profit. If this should occur, we may not be able to secure necessary equipment from an alternative source on acceptable terms and our business and reputation may be materially and adversely affected. If we are not able to anticipate and mitigate the risks associated with operating internationally, there could be a material adverse effect on our operating results. Currently, total foreign country customers and operations account for less than 10% of the Company’s revenues. In recent years some of our customers have expanded their international operations faster than domestic operations, and this trend may continue. Over time, the amount of our international business may increase if we focus on international market opportunities. Operating in foreign countries subjects the Company to additional risks, any of which may adversely impact our future operating results, including: • international political, economic and legal conditions including tariffs and trade barriers; • our ability to comply with customs, anti-corruption, import/export and other trade compliance regulations, together with any unexpected changes in such regulations; • greater difficulty in our ability to recover rental equipment and obtain payment of the related trade receivables; • additional costs to establish and maintain international subsidiaries and related operations; • difficulties in attracting and retaining staff and business partners to operate internationally; • language and cultural barriers; • seasonal reductions in business activities in the countries where our international customers are located; • difficulty with the integration of foreign operations; • longer payment cycles; • currency fluctuations; and • potential adverse tax consequences. 25 Unfavorable currency exchange rates may negatively impact our financial results in U.S. dollar terms. We receive revenues in Canadian dollars from our business activities in Canada. Conducting business in currencies other than U.S. dollars subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. If the currency exchange rates change unfavorably, the value of net receivables we receive in foreign currencies and later convert to U.S. dollars after the unfavorable change would be diminished. This could have a negative impact on our reported operating results. We currently do not engage in hedging strategies to mitigate this risk. SPECIFIC RISKS RELATED TO OUR LIQUID AND SOLID CONTAINMENT TANKS AND BOXES BUSINESS SEGMENT: We may be brought into tort or environmental litigation or held responsible for cleanup of spills if the customer fails to perform, or an accident occurs in the use of our rental products, which could materially adversely affect our business, future operating results or financial position. Our rental tanks and boxes are used by our customers to store non-hazardous and certain hazardous liquids and solids on the customer’s site. Our customers are generally responsible for proper operation of our tank and box rental equipment while on rent and returning a cleaned and undamaged container upon completion of use, but exceptions may be granted and we cannot always assure that these responsibilities are fully met in all cases. Although we require the customer to carry commercial general liability insurance in a minimum amount of $5,000,000, such policies often contain pollution exclusions and other exceptions. Furthermore, we cannot be certain our liability insurance will always be sufficient. In addition, if an accident were to occur involving our rental equipment or a spill of substances were to occur when the tank or box was in transport or on rent with our customer, a claim could be made against us as owner of the rental equipment. In the event of a spill or accident, we may be brought into a lawsuit or enforcement action by either our customer or a third party on numerous potential grounds, including an allegation that an inherent flaw in a tank or box contributed to an accident or that the tank had suffered some undiscovered harm from a previous customer’s prior use. In the event of a spill caused by our customers, we may be held responsible for cleanup under environmental laws and regulations concerning obligations of suppliers of rental products to effect remediation. In addition, applicable environmental laws and regulations may impose liability on us for the conduct of third parties, or for actions that complied with applicable regulations when taken, regardless of negligence or fault. Substantial damage awards have also been made in certain jurisdictions against lessors of industrial equipment based upon claims of personal injury, property damage, and resource damage caused by the use of various products. While we take what we believe are reasonable precautions that our rental equipment is in good and safe condition prior to rental and carry insurance to protect against certain risks of loss or accidents, such liability could adversely impact our profitability. The liquid and solid containment rental industry is highly competitive, and competitive pressures could lead to a decrease in our market share or in rental rates and our ability to rent, or sell, equipment at favorable prices, which could adversely affect our operating results. The liquid and solid containment rental industry is highly competitive. We compete against national, regional and local companies, including United Rentals, Rain For Rent and Mobile Mini, all of which may be larger than we are, may offer a wider range of products and services and may have greater financial and marketing resources than we have. Some of our competitors also have longer operating histories, lower cost basis of rental equipment and lower cost structures than we have. In addition, certain of our competitors are more geographically diverse than we are and have greater name recognition among customers than we do. As a result, our competitors that have these advantages may be better able to attract customers and provide their products and services at lower rental rates. Some competitors offer different approaches to liquid storage, such as large-volume modular tanks that may have better economics and compete with conventional frac tanks in certain oil and gas field applications. We may in the future encounter increased competition in the markets that we serve from existing competitors or from new market entrants. In July 2020, Wilscot acquired Mobile Mini and in July 2018, United Rentals, Inc. completed the acquisition of BakerCorp. Industry consolidation may create additional competition for customers and provide the combined entity access to greater financial resources than we have. We believe that equipment quality, service levels, rental rates and fleet size are key competitive factors in the liquid and solid containment rental industry. From time to time, we or our competitors may attempt to compete aggressively by lowering rental rates or prices. Competitive pressures could adversely affect our revenues and operating results by decreasing our market share or depressing rental rates. To the extent we lower rental rates or increase our fleet in order to retain or increase market share, our operating margins would be adversely impacted. In addition, we may not be able to match a larger competitor’s price reductions or fleet investment because of its greater financial resources, all of which could adversely impact our operating results through a combination of a decrease in our market share, revenues and operating income. 26 Market risk, commodity price volatility, regulatory changes or interruptions and cyclical downturns in the industries using tanks and boxes may result in periods of low demand for our products resulting in excess inventory, impairment charges and reduction of our operating results and cash flows. Adler Tanks’ revenues are derived from the rental of tanks and boxes to companies involved in oil and gas exploration, extraction and refinement, environmental remediation and wastewater/groundwater treatment, infrastructure and building construction and various industrial services, among others. We expect tank and box rental revenues will primarily be affected by the business activity within these industries. Historically, these industries have been cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns, which have a material adverse impact on the industry’s demand for equipment, including the tanks and boxes rented by us. Lower oil or gas prices may have an adverse effect on our liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes business. Any steep decline in both domestic and international oil and gas prices driven by materially higher supply levels and weak demand could have a significant negative impact on the industry’s demand for equipment, especially if such market conditions continue for an extended period of time. If the price reduction causes customers to limit or stop exploration, extraction or refinement activities, resulting in lower demand and pricing for renting Adler Tank’s products, our financial results could be adversely impacted. Also, a weak U.S. economy may negatively impact infrastructure construction and industrial activity. Any of these factors may result in excess inventory or impairment charges and reduce our operating results and cash flows. Changes in regulatory, or governmental, oversight of hydraulic fracturing could materially adversely affect the demand for our rental products and reduce our operating results and cash flows. We believe that demand related to hydraulic fracturing has increased the total rental revenues and market size in recent years. Oil and gas exploration and extraction (including use of tanks for hydraulic fracturing to obtain shale oil and shale gas) are subject to numerous local, state and federal regulations. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, oil and gas exploration and production accounted for approximately 7% of Adler Tanks’ rental revenues, and approximately 1% of the Company’s total revenues. The hydraulic fracturing method of extraction has come under scrutiny in several states and by the Federal government due to the potential adverse effects that hydraulic fracturing, and the liquids and chemicals used, may have on water quality and public health. In addition, the disposal of wastewater from the hydraulic fracturing process into injection wells may increase the rate of seismic activity near drill sites and could result in regulatory changes, delays or interruption of future activity. Changes in these regulations could limit, interrupt, or stop exploration and extraction activities, which would negatively impact the demand for our rental products. Finally, it is possible that changes in the technology utilized in hydraulic fracturing could make it less dependent on liquids and therefore lower the related requirements for the use of our rental products, which would reduce our operating results and cash flows. Seasonality of the liquid and solid containment rental industry may impact quarterly results. Rental activity may decline in the fourth quarter month of December and the first quarter months of January and February. These months may have lower rental activity in parts of the country where inclement weather may delay, or suspend, a company’s project. The impact of these delays may be to decrease the number of tanks, or boxes, on rent until companies are able to resume their projects when weather improves. These seasonal factors historically have impacted quarterly results in each year’s first and fourth quarter, but we are unable to predict how such factors may impact future periods. Significant increases in raw material, fuel and labor costs could increase our acquisition and operating costs of rental equipment, which would increase operating costs and decrease profitability. Increases in raw material costs such as steel and labor to manufacture liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes would increase the cost of acquiring new equipment. These price increases could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations if we are not able to recoup these increases through higher rental revenues. In addition, a significant amount of revenues are generated from the transport of rental equipment to and from customers. We own delivery trucks, employ drivers and utilize subcontractors to provide these services. The price of fuel can be unpredictable and beyond our control. During periods of rising fuel and labor costs, and in particular when prices increase rapidly, we may not be able recoup these costs from our customers, which would reduce our profitability. We derive a meaningful amount of our revenue in our liquid and solid containment tank and boxes business from a limited number of customers, the loss of one or more of which could have an adverse effect on our business. Periodically, a meaningful portion of our revenue in our liquid and solid containment tank and boxes business may be generated from a few major customers. Although we have some long-term relationships with our major customers, we cannot be assured that our customers will continue to use our products or services or that they will continue to do so at historical levels. The loss of any meaningful customer, the failure to collect a material receivable from a meaningful customer, any material reduction in orders by a meaningful customer or the cancellation of a meaningful customer order could significantly reduce our revenues and consequently harm our financial condition and our ability to fund our operations. 27 We may not be able to quickly redeploy equipment returning from leases at equivalent prices. Many of our rental transactions are short-term in nature with pricing established on a daily basis. The length of time that a customer needs equipment can often be difficult to determine and can be impacted by a number of factors such as weather, customer funding and project delays. In addition, our equipment is primarily used in the oil and gas, industrial plant services, environmental remediation and infrastructure and building construction industries. Changes in the economic conditions facing any of those industries could result in a significant number of units returning off rent, both for us and our competitors. If the supply of rental equipment available on the market significantly increases due to units coming off rent, demand for and pricing of our rental products could be adversely impacted. We may experience delays in remarketing our off-rent units to new customers and incur cost to move the units to other regions where demand is stronger. Actions in these circumstances by our competitors may also depress the market price for rental units. These delays and price pressures would adversely affect equipment utilization levels and total revenues, which would reduce our profitability. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES. The Company’s corporate and administrative offices are located in Livermore, California in approximately 26,000 square feet. The Company’s four reportable business segments currently conduct operations from the following locations: Mobile Modular – Seven inventory centers, at which relocatable modular buildings and storage containers are displayed, refurbished and stored are located in Livermore, California (137 acres in the San Francisco Bay Area), Mira Loma, California (79 acres in the Los Angeles area), Pasadena, Texas (50 acres in the Houston area), in Grand Prairie, Texas (43 acres in the Dallas area), Auburndale, Florida (123 acres in the Orlando area), Arcade, Georgia (48 acres in the Atlanta area) and Fredericksburg, Virginia (68 acres in the Washington D.C. area). The inventory centers conduct rental and sales operations from modular buildings, serving as working models of the Company’s modular product. The Company also has a leased modular sales office in Charlotte, North Carolina from which the states of North Carolina and South Carolina are served. TRS-RenTelco – Electronic test equipment rental and sales operations are conducted from a 117,000 square foot leased facility in Grapevine, Texas (Dallas area) and a sales office in Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Quebec (Montreal, Canada area). Adler Tanks – Adler Tanks operates from branch offices serving the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, Southeast, Southwest and West. A number of our branch offices are leased and have remaining lease terms of one to three years, or are leased on a month to month basis. We believe satisfactory alternative properties can be found in all of our markets if we do not renew our existing leased properties. Enviroplex – The Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Enviroplex, manufactures modular buildings used primarily as classrooms in California from its 108,000 square foot facility in Stockton, California (San Francisco Bay Area). ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. The Company is involved in various lawsuits and routine claims arising out of the normal course of its business. The Company maintains insurance coverage for its operations and employees with appropriate aggregate, per occurrence and deductible limits as the Company reasonably determines necessary or prudent with current operations and historical experience. The major policies include coverage for property, general liability, auto, directors and officers, health, and workers’ compensation insurances. In the opinion of management, the ultimate amount of liability not covered by insurance, if any, under any pending litigation and claims, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position or operating results of the Company. ITEM 4. MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES. Not Applicable 28 PART II ITEM 5. MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES. The Company's common stock is traded in the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “MGRC”. As of February 23, 2021, the Company's common stock was held by approximately 40 shareholders of record, which does not include shareholders whose shares are held in street or nominee name. The Company believes that when holders in street or nominee name are added, the number of holders of the Company's common stock exceeds 500. Stock Repurchase Plan The Company has in the past made purchases of shares of its common stock from time to time in over-the-counter market (NASDAQ) transactions, through privately negotiated, large block transactions and through a share repurchase plan, in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In August 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase 2,000,000 shares of the Company's outstanding common stock (the “Repurchase Plan”). The amount and time of the specific repurchases are subject to prevailing market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors, including management’s discretion. All shares repurchased by the Company are canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares of common stock. There can be no assurance that any authorized shares will be repurchased and the repurchase program may be modified, extended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. There were 282,221 shares of common stock repurchased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 for the aggregate purchase price of $13.6 million or an average price of $48.25 per repurchased share. There were no repurchases of common stock during the fourth quarter 2020 and twelve months ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, 1,309,805 shares remain authorized for repurchase under the Repurchase Plan. 29 ITEM 6. SELECTED FINANCIAL DATA.

The Company presents Adjusted EBITDA as a financial measure as management believes it provides useful information to investors regarding the Company’s liquidity and financial condition and because management, as well as the Company’s lenders, use this measure in evaluating the performance of the Company. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a supplement to GAAP measures to further evaluate period-to-period operating performance, compliance with financial covenants in the Company’s revolving lines of credit and senior notes and the Company’s ability to meet future capital expenditure and working capital requirements. Management believes the exclusion of non-cash charges, including share-based compensation, is useful in measuring the Company’s cash available for operations and performance of the Company. Because management finds Adjusted EBITDA useful, the Company believes its investors will also find Adjusted EBITDA useful in evaluating the Company’s performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, cash flows, or other consolidated income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of the Company’s profitability or liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA is not in accordance with or an alternative for GAAP, and may be different from non−GAAP measures used by other companies. Unlike EBITDA, which may be used by other companies or investors, Adjusted EBITDA does not include share-based compensation charges. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is of limited use in that it does not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and does not accurately reflect real cash flow. In addition, other companies may not use Adjusted EBITDA or may use other non-GAAP measures, limiting the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA for purposes of comparison. The Company’s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that the Company will not incur expenses that are the same as or similar to the adjustments in this presentation. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA should only be used to evaluate the Company’s results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. The Company compensates for the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA by relying upon GAAP results to gain a complete picture of the Company’s performance. Because Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure, as defined by the SEC, the Company includes in the tables below reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.

Adjusted EBITDA is a component of two restrictive financial covenants for the Company’s unsecured Credit Facility, Series B Senior Notes and Series C Senior Notes (as defined and more fully described under the heading “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources”). These instruments contain financial covenants requiring the Company to not: • Permit the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility and the Note Purchase Agreement (as defined and more fully described under the heading “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Liquidity and Capital Resources” in this MD&A)) of Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility and the Note Purchase Agreement) to fixed charges as of the end of any fiscal quarter to be less than 2.50 to 1. At December 31, 2020, the actual ratio was 4.34 to 1. • Permit the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of funded debt (as defined in the Credit Facility and the Note Purchase Agreement) to Adjusted EBITDA at any time during any period of four consecutive quarters to be greater than 2.75 to 1. At December 31, 2020, the actual ratio was 0.92 to 1. At December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with each of these aforementioned covenants. There are no anticipated trends that the Company is aware of that would indicate non-compliance with these covenants, though, significant deterioration in our financial performance could impact the Company's ability to comply with these covenants. 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company’s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth in this section as well as those discussed under Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this document. This discussion should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes thereto set forth in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Results of Operations General The Company, incorporated in 1979, is a leading rental provider of relocatable modular buildings for classroom and office space, electronic test equipment for general purpose and communications needs, and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes. The Company’s primary emphasis is on equipment rentals. The Company is comprised of four reportable business segments: (1) its modular building and portable storage container rental segment (“Mobile Modular”); (2) its electronic test equipment rental segment (“TRS-RenTelco”); (3) its containment solutions for the storage of hazardous and non-hazardous liquids and solids segment (“Adler Tanks”); and (4) its classroom manufacturing segment selling modular buildings used primarily as classrooms in California (“Enviroplex”). In 2020, Mobile Modular, TRS-RenTelco, Adler Tanks and Enviroplex contributed 62%, 26%, 6% and 6%, respectively, of the Company’s income before provision for taxes (the equivalent of “pre-tax income”), compared to 54%, 27%, 11% and 8%, respectively, for 2019. The Company generates its revenues primarily from the rental of its equipment on operating leases with sales of equipment occurring in the normal course of business. The Company requires significant capital outlay to purchase its rental inventory and recovers its investment through rental and sales revenues. Rental revenue and certain other service revenues negotiated as part of the lease agreements with customers and related costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the lease. Sales revenue and related costs are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment to the customers. Sales revenues are less predictable and can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer demands and requirements. Generally, rental revenues less cash operating costs recover the equipment’s capitalized cost in a shorter period of time relative to the equipment’s potential rental life and when sold, sale proceeds are usually above its net book value. The Company’s rental operations include rental and rental related services revenues which comprised approximately 78% and 79% of the Company’s total revenues in 2020 and for the three years ended December 31, 2020, respectively. Over the past three years, modulars, electronic test equipment and tanks and boxes comprised approximately 55%, 24% and 21%, respectively, of the cumulative rental operations revenues. The Company’s direct costs of rental operations include depreciation of rental equipment, rental related service costs, impairment of rental equipment, and other direct costs of rental operations (which include direct labor, supplies, repairs, insurance, property taxes, license fees and amortization of certain lease costs). The Company sells modular, electronic test equipment and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes that are new, or previously rented. The Company’s Enviroplex subsidiary manufactures and sells modular classrooms. The renting and selling of some modular equipment requires a dealer’s license, which the Company has obtained from the appropriate governmental agencies. Sales and other revenues of modulars, electronic test equipment and tanks and boxes have comprised approximately 22% and 21% of the Company’s consolidated revenues in 2020 and for the three years ended December 31, 2020. Over the past three years, modulars, electronic test equipment and tanks and boxes comprised approximately 76%, 23% and 1% of sales and other revenues, respectively. The Company’s cost of sales includes the carrying value of the equipment sold and the direct costs associated with the equipment sold such as delivery, installation, modifications and related site work. The rental and sale of modulars to public school districts comprised 23%, 25% and 24% of the Company’s consolidated rental and sales revenues for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. (For more information, see “Item 1. Business – Relocatable Modular Buildings – Classroom Rentals and Sales to Public Schools (K-12)” above.) Selling and administrative expenses primarily include personnel and benefit costs, which includes share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, bad debt expense, advertising costs, and professional service fees. The Company believes that sharing of common facilities, financing, senior management, and operating and accounting systems by all of the Company’s operations, results in an efficient use of overhead. Historically, the Company’s operating margins have been impacted favorably to the extent its costs and expenses are leveraged over a large installed customer base. However, there can be no assurance as to the Company’s ability to maintain a large installed customer base or ability to sustain its historical operating margins. 33 Recent Developments Dividends In February 2021, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $0.435 per common share for the quarter ending March 31, 2021, an increase of 4% over the prior year’s comparable quarter. Credit Facility and Note Purchase Agreement In March 2020, the Company renewed its $420 million credit facility with a syndicate of banks. The five-year facility matures on March 31, 2025 and replaced the Company’s existing $420 million line of credit. B of A Securities, Inc. served as Sole Bookrunner and Joint Lead Arranger. Bank of America, N.A. served as Administrative Agent, U.S. Bank National Association served as Joint Lead Arranger and Syndication Agent, and MUFG Union Bank N.A. and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. served as Syndication Agents. In March 2020, the Company entered into an amended and restated $250 million note purchase and private shelf agreement with Prudential Private Capital (the “Note Purchase Agreement”). In addition to governing the terms of the current $40 million Series B Senior Notes and $60 million Series C Senior Notes outstanding, the Note Purchase Agreement allows for the issuance of up to an additional $150 million of senior notes on terms to be determined at such time that any additional notes are issued. In October 2020, the Company entered into a rate lock agreement with Prudential Private Capital, pursuant to which, the Company agreed to a fixed interest rate of 2.57% for future issuance, if any, of senior unsecured notes in the aggregate amount of $40.0 million with a 7-year maturity. If issued, the funding for such notes would occur on or before March 17, 2021 and would be subject to the terms and conditions of the Note Purchase Agreement. COVID-19 The outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, which began in December 2019, has continued to spread globally including to every state in the United States. The Center for Disease Control (“CDC”) and World Health Organization (“WHO”) have recognized this outbreak as a pandemic, which has caused shutdowns to businesses and cities worldwide while disrupting supply chains, business operations, travel, consumer confidence and business sentiment. Each of the states in which the Company operates, and in some cases the localities as well, have previously issued orders requiring the closure of non-essential business and/or requiring residents to stay at home, however, currently none of the Company’s locations are required to be closed by local or state order. The Company is following guidelines established by the CDC and WHO and orders issued by state and local governments where the Company operates. The Company has taken a number of precautionary health and safety measures to safeguard its employees and customers, while maintaining business continuity to enable each of its operating segments and branch locations to continue providing services to customers identified as essential businesses under the relevant state and local rules. The Company has implemented remote work policies, restricted travel, separated work groups, enhanced cleaning and hygiene protocols in all of its facilities, products and vehicles, and requires distancing protocols for production and logistical personnel. The Company is continuing to monitor and assessing orders issued by federal, state and local governments to ensure compliance with evolving COVID-19 guidelines. The Company also continues to monitor the impact of COVID-19 on its existing customers who themselves may be impacted by governmental shutdowns and other impacts due to the governmental orders. As of the date of this filing, significant uncertainty continues to exist concerning the magnitude of the impact and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic. While the Company's operating segments and branch locations currently continue to operate, the Company’s results of operations may be negatively impacted by project delays; early returns of equipment currently on rent with customers; overall decreased customer demand for new rental orders, rental related services and sales of new and used rental equipment; and payment delay, or non-payment, by customers who are significantly impacted by COVID-19 . In light of the uncertain and rapidly evolving situation relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company has taken a number of precautionary measures to manage its resources conservatively by reducing and/or deferring non-essential capital expenditures and operating expenses to mitigate the adverse impact of the pandemic. The Company will continue to assess its capital expenditure needs against its cash availability during the crisis to make the most strategic decisions for its business. Furthermore, the Company believes that its recently renewed $420 million credit facility, coupled with its ability to access additional capital through the issuance of up to $150 million in additional senior notes, will strengthen the Company’s liquidity position and serve to mitigate some of the operational risk related to decreased customer demand for new rental orders and sales resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. While the Company has not seen a significant impact from COVID-19 in the financial results for the year ended December 31, 2020 as set forth in the below section discussing the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company is currently unable to determine or predict the full nature, duration or scope of the overall impact the COVID-19 pandemic will have on its business, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources. The Company will continue to actively monitor the situation and may take further actions that alter its business operations as may be required by federal, state or local authorities or that the Company determines are in the best interests of employees, customers and shareholders. 34 Percentage of Revenue Table The following table sets forth for the periods indicated the results of operations as a percentage of the Company’s total revenues and the percentage of changes in the amount of such of items as compared to the amount in the indicated prior period: Percent of Total Revenues Percent Change Three Years Year Ended December 31, 2020 over 2019 over 2020–2018 2020 2019 2018 2019 2018 Revenues Rental 62 % 61 % 62 % 64 % (1 )% 11 % Rental related services 17 17 18 17 (9 ) 22 Rental operations 79 78 80 81 (2 ) 13 Sales 20 22 19 19 13 19 Other 1 — 1 — (26 ) 26 Total revenues 100 100 100 100 0 14 Costs and expenses Direct costs of rental operations Depreciation of rental equipment 15 15 14 15 7 10 Rental related services 13 12 13 13 (11 ) 19 Other 14 13 14 14 (7 ) 16 Total direct costs of rental operations 41 40 41 42 (3 ) 14 Cost of sales 12 14 12 11 19 15 Total costs 53 54 53 53 2 15 Gross profit 47 46 47 47 (1 ) 14 Selling and administrative expenses 23 21 22 23 (1 ) 8 Income from operations 24 25 25 24 0 20 Other income (expense): Interest expense 2 2 2 3 (29 ) 0 Foreign currency exchange gain (loss) — — — — nm nm Income before provision for income taxes 22 23 23 21 2 23 Provision for income taxes 5 5 6 5 (7 ) 28 Net income 17 % 18 % 17 % 16 % 5 % 22 % nm = not meaningful 35 Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2020 Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2019 Overview Consolidated revenues in 2020 increased to $572.6 million from $570.2 million in 2019. Consolidated net income in 2020 increased to $102.0 million, or $4.16 per diluted share in 2020, compared to $96.8 million, or $3.93 per diluted share, in 2019. The Company’s year over year total revenue increase was primarily due to higher sales revenues, partly offset by lower rental and rental related services revenues as more fully described below. For 2020 compared to 2019, on a consolidated basis: • Gross profit decreased $2.4 million, or 1%, to $263.7 million. Mobile Modular’s gross profit increased $12.3 million, or 9%, due to higher gross profit on rental, rental related services and sales revenues. TRS-RenTelco’s gross profit increased $0.1 million, primarily due to higher gross profit on sales and rental related services revenues. Enviroplex’s gross profit decreased $1.9 million, or 13%, due to $7.1 million lower sales revenues. Adler Tanks’ gross profit decreased $12.9 million, or 28%, due to lower gross profit on rental, rental related services and sales revenues. • Selling and administrative expenses decreased $1.8 million, or 1%, to $123.0 million, primarily due to decreased travel, meals and meeting expenses. • Interest expense decreased $3.5 million, or 29%, due to 21% lower net average interest rate of 3.25% in 2020 compared to 4.10% in 2019 and 10% lower average debt levels of the Company. • Pre-tax income contribution was 62%, 26% and 6% by Mobile Modular, TRS-RenTelco and Adler Tanks, respectively, in 2019, compared to 54%, 27% and 11%, respectively, in 2019. These results are discussed on a segment basis below. Pre-tax income contribution by Enviroplex was 6% and 8% in 2020 and 2019, respectively. • The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 22.8% and 25.0% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. • Adjusted EBITDA increased $4.2 million, or 2%, to $241.0 million in 2020. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash impairment costs and share-based compensation. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net cash provided by operating activities and net income to Adjusted EBITDA can be found in “Item 6. Selected Financial Data.” on page 30. 36 Mobile Modular For 2020, Mobile Modular’s total revenues increased $20.5 million, or 7%, to $321.5 million compared to 2019, primarily due to higher sales and rental revenues, partly offset by lower rental related services. The revenue increase, together with higher gross profit on rental, rental related services and sales revenues, partly offset by higher selling and administrative expenses, resulted in an increase in pre-tax income of $12.3 million, or 18%, to $82.3 million in 2020.

For the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019: • Gross Profit on Rental Revenues – Rental revenues increased $6.4 million, or 4%, due to 1% higher average rental equipment on rent and 2% higher average monthly rental rates. As a percentage of rental revenues, depreciation was 12% in 2020 and 2019 and other direct costs were 25% in 2020 and 28% in 2019, which resulted in gross margin percentage of 63% in 2020 compared to 60% and 2019. The higher rental revenues and higher rental margins resulted in gross profit on rental revenues increasing $8.9 million, or 8%, to $118.0 million in 2020. • Gross Profit on Rental Related Services – Rental related services revenues decreased $1.9 million, or 3%, compared to 2019. Most of these service revenues are negotiated with the initial lease and are recognized on a straight-line basis with the associated costs over the initial term of the lease. The decrease in rental related services revenues was primarily attributable to lower amortization of modular building delivery and return delivery and dismantle revenues and lower repair revenues, partly offset by increased site related services revenues. The lower revenues offset by higher gross margin percentage of 28% in 2020 compared to 25% in 2019 resulted in rental related services gross profit increasing $1.0 million, or 6%, to $18.6 million in 2020. • Gross Profit on Sales – Sales revenues increased $16.8 million, or 36%, primarily due to higher new and used equipment sales. The higher sales revenues, partly offset by lower gross margins of 28% in 2020 compared to 31% in 2019, resulted in sales gross profit increasing $3.2 million, or 22%, to $17.9 million in 2020. Sales occur routinely as a normal part of Mobile Modular’s rental business; however, these sales can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer requirements, equipment availability and funding. For 2020, Mobile Modular’s selling and administrative expenses increased $2.8 million, or 4%, to $68.5 million, primarily due to higher allocated corporate expenses and increased salaries and benefit costs, partly offset by lower travel, meals and meeting costs. 38 TRS-RenTelco For 2020, TRS-RenTelco’s total revenues increased $9.3 million, or 7%, to $140.8 million compared to 2019, primarily due to higher rental and sales revenues. Pre-tax income increased $0.3 million, or 1%, to $34.5 million for 2020, primarily due to higher gross profit on sales and rental related services revenues and lower selling and administrative expenses. The following table summarizes year-to-year results for each revenue and gross profit category, income from operations, pre-tax income, and other selected information.

For the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019: • Gross Profit on Rental Revenues – Rental revenues increased $5.4 million, or 5%, to $109.1 million with depreciation expense increasing $4.5 million, or 11%, and other direct costs increasing $0.8 million, or 5%, resulting in a comparable gross profit on rental revenues of $45.5 million in 2020 and 2019. As a percentage of rental revenues, depreciation was 43% in 2020 and 40% in 2019 and other direct costs was 16% in 2020 and 2019, which resulted in gross margin percentage of 42% in 2020 compared to 44% in 2019. The rental revenues increase was due to 10% higher average rental equipment on rent, partly offset by 4% lower average monthly rental rates. • Gross Profit on Sales – Sales revenues increased $4.5 million, or 20%, to $26.6 million in 2020. Gross profit on sales increased $0.3 million with gross margin percentage decreasing to 48% from 56% in 2019, primarily due to lower gross margins on used equipment sales. Sales occur routinely as a normal part of TRS-RenTelco’s rental business; however, these sales and related gross margins can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer requirements, equipment availability and funding. For 2020, TRS-RenTelco’s selling and administrative expenses decreased $0.3 million, or 1%, to $24.3 million, primarily due to lower salaries and benefit costs and lower travel, meals and meeting expenses, partly offset by higher allocated corporate expenses. 40 Adler Tanks For 2020, Adler Tanks’ total revenues decreased $20.4 million, or 21%, to $77.5 million compared to 2019, primarily due to lower rental and rental related services revenues. Pre-tax income decreased $7.0 million, primarily due to lower gross profit on rental, rental related services and sales, partly offset by lower selling and administrative expenses.

For the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to year ended December 31, 2019: • Gross Profit on Rental Revenues – Rental revenues decreased $13.9 million, or 20%, to $54.0 million, due to 18% lower average rental equipment on rent and 2% lower average monthly rental rates in 2020 as compared to 2019. The rental revenue decrease was primarily due to COVID-19 related business disruptions and a decrease in the price of oil and gas, which contributed to weaker activities in multiple geographic and market segments. As a percentage of rental revenues, depreciation was 30% and 24% in 2020 and 2019, respectively, and other direct costs were 17% and 18% in 2020 and 2019, respectively, which resulted in gross margin percentages of 53% in 2020 compared to 58% in 2019. The lower rental revenues, together with lower rental margins resulted in gross profit on rental revenues decreasing $10.9 million, or 28%, to $28.6 million in 2020. • Gross Profit on Rental Related Services – Rental related services revenues decreased $6.6 million, or 23%, compared to 2019.

For the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018: • Gross Profit on Rental Revenues – Rental revenues increased $23.2 million, or 15%, due to 6% higher average rental equipment on rent and 8% higher average monthly rental rates. As a percentage of rental revenues, depreciation was 12% in 2019 compared to 13% in 2018 and other direct costs were 28% in 2019 and 27% in 2018, which resulted in gross margin percentage of 60% in 2019 and 2018. The higher rental revenues and comparable rental margins resulted in gross profit on rental revenues increasing $14.0 million, or 15%, to $109.1 million in 2019. • Gross Profit on Rental Related Services – Rental related services revenues increased $14.7 million, or 27%, compared to 2018. Most of these service revenues are negotiated with the initial lease and are recognized on a straight-line basis with the associated costs over the initial term of the lease. The increase in rental related services revenues was primarily attributable to higher amortization of modular building delivery and return delivery and dismantle revenues and increased services performed during the lease. The higher revenues and higher gross margin percentage of 25% in 2019 compared to 24% in 2018 resulted in rental related services gross profit increasing $4.6 million, or 35%, to $17.6 million in 2019. • Gross Profit on Sales – Sales revenues increased $7.6 million, or 19%, primarily due to higher new and used equipment sales. The higher sales revenues, together with higher gross margins of 31% in 2019 compared to 29% in 2018, resulted in sales gross profit increasing $3.3 million, or 29%, to $14.6 million in 2019.

For the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to the year ended December 31, 2018: • Gross Profit on Rental Revenues – Rental revenues increased $13.8 million, or 15%, to $103.7 million with depreciation expense increasing $5.9 million, or 16%, and other direct costs increasing $1.6 million, or 11%, resulting in an increase in gross profit on rental revenues of $6.2 million, or 16%, to $45.5 million in 2019. As a percentage of rental revenues, depreciation was 40% in 2019 and 2018 and other direct costs was 16% in 2019 and 2018, which resulted in gross margin percentage of 44% in 2019 and 2018. The rental revenues increase was due to 17% higher average rental equipment on rent, partly offset by 2% lower average monthly rental rates. • Gross Profit on Sales – Sales revenues decreased $1.0 million, or 4%, to $22.1 million in 2019. Gross profit on sales decreased $0.2 million with gross margin percentage increasing to 56% from 55% in 2018, primarily due to higher gross margins on used equipment sales. Sales occur routinely as a normal part of TRS-RenTelco’s rental business; however, these sales and related gross margins can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer requirements, equipment availability and funding. For 2019, TRS-RenTelco’s selling and administrative expenses increased $1.8 million, or 8%, to $24.6 million, primarily due to higher salaries and employee benefit costs and higher allocated corporate expenses. 47 Adler Tanks For 2019, Adler Tanks’ total revenues increased $1.9 million, or 2%, to $97.9 million compared to 2018, primarily due to higher rental related services and sales revenues, partly offset by lower rental revenues. Pre-tax income decreased $0.5 million, primarily due to lower gross profit on rental revenues, partly offset by higher gross profit on rental related services and lower selling and administrative expenses. The following table summarizes year-to-year results for each revenue and gross profit category, income from operations, pre-tax income and other selected information.

For the year ended December 31, 2019 compared to year ended December 31, 2018: • Gross Profit on Rental Revenues – Rental revenues decreased $1.8 million, or 3%, to $67.9 million, due to 8% lower average rental equipment on rent, partly offset by 5% higher average monthly rental rates in 2019 as compared to 2018. As a percentage of rental revenues, depreciation was 24% and 23% in 2019 and 2018, respectively, and other direct costs were 18% and 16% in 2019 and 2018, respectively, which resulted in gross margin percentages of 58% in 2019 compared to 61% in 2018. The lower rental revenues, together with lower rental margins resulted in gross profit on rental revenues decreasing $3.0 million, or 7%, to $39.6 million in 2019. • Gross Profit on Rental Related Services – Rental related services revenues increased $3.5 million, or 14%, compared to 2018, primarily due to increased cleaning and repair revenues. The higher revenues together with higher gross margin percentage of 24% in 2019 compared to 20% in 2018 resulted in rental related services gross profit increasing $1.7 million, or 34%, to $6.7 million in 2019. For 2019, Adler Tanks’ selling and administrative expenses decreased $0.7 million, or 2%, to $29.3 million, primarily due to decreased employee headcount, salaries and benefit costs. 49 Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company’s rental businesses are capital intensive and generate significant cash flows. Cash flows for the Company in 2020 as compared to 2019 are summarized as follows: Cash Flows from Operating Activities: The Company’s operations provided net cash flow of $180.5 million for 2020 as compared to $188.0 million in 2019. The 4% decrease was primarily attributable to decreased deferred income and deferred income taxes, a lower decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and other balance sheet changes. Cash Flows from Investing Activities: Net cash used in investing activities was $53.0 million for 2020 as compared to $143.1 million in 2019. The $90.1 million decrease was primarily due to $81.4 million lower purchases of rental equipment of $86.3 million in 2020, compared to 2019, and $7.8 million lower cash paid for acquisition of business assets, partly offset by $1.6 million higher purchases of property, plant and equipment and $2.6 million higher proceeds from sales of used rental equipment. Cash Flows from Financing Activities: Net cash used in financing activities was $128.5 million in 2020 as compared to $44.0 million in 2019. The $84.4 million increase was primarily due to $65.5 million higher net repayment under bank lines of credit, $13.6 million higher repurchases of common stock and $4.3 million higher dividend payments. Significant capital expenditures are required to maintain and grow the Company’s rental assets. During the last three years, the Company has financed its working capital and capital expenditure requirements through cash flows from operations, proceeds from the sale of rental equipment and from bank borrowings. Sales occur routinely as a normal part of the Company’s rental businesses. However, these sales can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer requirements and funding. Although the net proceeds received from sales may fluctuate from period to period, the Company believes its liquidity will not be adversely impacted from lower sales in any given year because it believes it has the ability to increase its bank borrowings, offer additional notes and conserve its cash in the future by reducing the amount of cash it uses to purchase rental equipment, pay dividends, or repurchase the Company’s common stock. As the following table indicates, cash flow provided by operating activities and proceeds from sales of used rental equipment have been greater than rental equipment purchases over the past three years. Funding of Rental Asset Growth (amounts in thousands) Year Ended December 31, Three Year 2020 2019 2018 Totals Cash provided by operating activities $ 180,504 $ 187,994 $ 142,667 $ 511,165 Proceeds from sales of used rental equipment 47,052 44,447 41,786 133,285 Cash available for purchase of rental equipment 227,556 232,441 184,453 644,450 Purchases of rental equipment (86,329 ) (167,703 ) (123,071 ) (377,103 ) Cash paid for acquisition of business assets — (7,808 ) (7,543 ) (15,351 ) Cash available for other uses $ 141,227 $ 56,930 $ 53,839 $ 251,996 In addition to increasing its rental assets, the Company had other capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment of $13.7 million in 2020, $12.1 million in 2019 and $15.7 million in 2018, and has used cash to provide returns to its shareholders in the form of cash dividends. The Company paid cash dividends of $39.8 million, $35.5 million and $30.9 million in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The Company has in the past made purchases of shares of its common stock from time to time in over-the-counter market (NASDAQ) transactions, through privately negotiated, large block transactions and through a share repurchase plan, in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In August 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase 2,000,000 shares of the Company's outstanding common stock (the “Repurchase Plan”). The amount and time of the specific repurchases are subject to prevailing market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors, including management’s discretion. All shares repurchased by the Company are canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares of common stock. There can be no assurance that any authorized shares will be repurchased and the repurchase program may be modified, extended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. There were 282,221 shares of common stock repurchased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 for the aggregate purchase price of $13.6 million or an average price of $48.25 per repurchased share. There were no repurchases of common stock during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, 1,309,805 shares remain authorized for repurchase under the Repurchase Plan. 50 Unsecured Revolving Lines of Credit On March 31, 2020, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, Swing Line Lender, L/C Issuer and lender, and other lenders named therein (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility provides for a $420.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (which may be further increased to $670.0 million by adding one or more tranches of term loans and/or increasing the aggregate revolving commitments), which includes a $25.0 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a $10.0 million sublimit for swingline loans. The proceeds of the Credit Facility are available to be used for general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions. The Credit Facility permits the Company’s existing indebtedness to remain, which includes the Company’s $12.0 million Treasury Sweep Note due March 31, 2025, the Company’s existing senior notes issued pursuant to the Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement with Prudential Investment Management, Inc., dated as of April 21, 2011 (as amended, the “the Prior NPA”): (i) the $40.0 million aggregate outstanding principal of notes issued March 17, 2014 and due March 17, 2021, and (ii) the $60.0 million aggregate outstanding principal of notes issued November 5, 2015 and due November 5, 2022. In addition, the Company may incur additional senior note indebtedness in an aggregate amount not to exceed $250.0 million. The Credit Facility matures on March 31, 2025 and replaced the Company’s prior $420.0 million credit facility dated March 31, 2016 with Bank of America, N.A., as agent, as amended. All obligations outstanding under the prior credit facility as of the date of the Credit Facility were refinanced by the Credit Facility on March 31, 2020. On March 31, 2020, the Company entered into an amended and restated Credit Facility Letter Agreement and a Credit Line Note in favor of MUFG Union Bank, N.A., which provides for a $12.0 million line of credit facility related to its cash management services (“Sweep Service Facility”). The Sweep Service Facility matures on the earlier of March 31, 2025, or the date the Company ceases to utilize MUFG Union Bank, N.A. for its cash management services. The Sweep Service Facility replaced the Company’s prior $12.0 million sweep service facility, dated as of March 31, 2016. At December 31, 2020, under the Credit Facility and Sweep Service Facility, the Company had unsecured lines of credit that permit it to borrow up to $432.0 million of which $122.8 million was outstanding. The Credit Facility contains financial covenants requiring the Company to not (all defined terms used below not otherwise defined herein have the meaning assigned to such terms in the Amended Credit Facility): • Permit the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges as of the end of any fiscal quarter to be less than 2.50 to 1. At December 31, 2020, the actual ratio was 4.34 to 1. • Permit the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of funded debt to EBITDA at any time during any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters to be greater than 2.75 to 1. At December 31, 2020, the actual ratio was 0.92 to 1. At December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with each of the aforementioned covenants. There are no anticipated trends that the Company is aware of that would indicate non-compliance with these covenants, although significant deterioration in our financial performance could impact the Company’s ability to comply with these covenants. Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement In March 2020, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement (the “Note Purchase Agreement”) with PGIM, Inc. (“PGIM”) and the holders of Series B and Series C Notes previously issued pursuant to the Prior NPA, among the Company and the other parties to the Note Purchase Agreement. The Note Purchase Agreement amended and restated, and superseded in its entirety, the Prior NPA. Pursuant to the Prior NPA, the Company issued (i) $40.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.68% Series B Senior Notes due March 17, 2021, and (ii) $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.84% Series C Senior Notes due November 5, 2022, to which the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement shall apply. In addition, pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, the Company may authorize the issuance and sale of additional senior notes (the “Shelf Notes”) in the aggregate principal amount of (x) $250 million minus (y) the amount of other notes (such as the Series B Senior Notes and Series C Senior Notes, each defined below) then outstanding, to be dated the date of issuance thereof, to mature, in case of each Shelf Note so issued, no more than 15 years after the date of original issuance thereof, to have an average life, in the case of each Shelf Note so issued, of no more than 15 years after the date of original issuance thereof, to bear interest on the unpaid balance thereof from the date thereof at the rate per annum, and to have such other particular terms, as shall be set forth, in the case of each Shelf Note so issued, in accordance with the Note Purchase Agreement. Shelf Notes may be issued and sold from time to time at the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors and in such amounts as the Board of Directors may determine, subject to prospective purchasers’ agreement to purchase the Shelf Notes. The Company will sell the Shelf Notes directly to such purchasers. The full net proceeds of each Shelf Note will be used in the manner described in the applicable Request for Purchase with respect to such Shelf Note. On October 1, 2020, the Company entered into a rate lock agreement with Prudential Private Capital, pursuant to which, the Company agreed to a fixed interest rate of 2.57% for future issuance, if any, of senior unsecured notes in the aggregate amount of $40.0 million with a 7-year maturity. If issued, the funding for such notes would occur on or before March 17, 2021 and would be subject to the terms and conditions of the Note Purchase Agreement. 51 3.68% Senior Notes Due in 2021 In March 2014, the Company issued and sold to the Purchasers a $40.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.68% Series B Senior Notes (the “Series B Senior Notes”) pursuant to the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement, as amended. The Series B Senior Notes are an unsecured obligation of the Company and bear interest at a rate of 3.68% per annum and mature on March 17, 2021. Interest on the Series B Senior Notes is payable semi-annually beginning on September 17, 2014 and continuing thereafter on March 17 and September 17 of each year until maturity. The principal balance is due when the notes mature in 2021. The full net proceeds from the Series B Senior Notes were used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2020, the principal balance outstanding under the Series B Senior Notes was $40.0 million. 3.84% Senior Notes Due in 2022 In November 2015, the Company issued and sold to the Purchasers a $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.84% Series C Senior Notes (the “Series C Senior Notes”) pursuant to the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement, as amended. The Series C Senior Notes are an unsecured obligation of the Company and bear interest at a rate of 3.84% per annum and mature on November 5, 2022. Interest on the Series C Senior Notes is payable semi-annually beginning on May 5, 2016 and continuing thereafter on November 5 and May 5 of each year until maturity. The principal balance is due when the notes mature in 2022. The full net proceeds from the Series C Senior Notes were used to reduce the outstanding balance on the Company’s revolving credit line. At December 31, 2020, the principal balance outstanding under the Series C Senior Notes was $60.0 million. Among other restrictions, the Note Purchase Agreement, under which the Series B Senior Notes and Series C Senior Notes were sold, contains financial covenants requiring the Company to not (all defined terms used below not otherwise defined herein have the meaning assigned to such terms in the Note Purchase Agreement): • Permit the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of EBITDA (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) to fixed charges as of the end of any fiscal quarter to be less than 2.50 to 1. At December 31, 2020, the actual ratio was 4.34 to 1. • Permit the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of funded debt to EBITDA (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) at any time during any period of four consecutive quarters to be greater than 2.75 to 1. At December 31, 2020, the actual ratio was 0.92 to 1. At December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with each of the aforementioned covenants. There are no anticipated trends that the Company is aware of that would indicate non-compliance with these covenants, although significant deterioration in our financial performance could impact the Company’s ability to comply with these covenants. Although no assurance can be given, the Company believes it will continue to be able to negotiate general bank lines of credit and issue senior notes adequate to meet capital requirements not otherwise met by operational cash flows and proceeds from sales of rental equipment. Furthermore, the Company believes it has the financial resources to weather the expected impacts of COVID-19. However, the Company has limited insight into the extent to which its business may be impacted by COVID-19, and there are many uncertainties, including how long and how severely the Company will be impacted. An extended and severe impact may materially and adversely affect the Company’s future operations, financial position and liquidity. Contractual Obligations and Commitments At December 31, 2020, the Company’s material contractual obligations and commitments consisted of outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities expiring in 2025, outstanding amounts under our 3.68% and 3.84% senior notes due in 2021 and 2022, respectively, and operating leases for facilities. The operating lease amounts exclude property taxes and insurance. The table below provides a summary of the Company’s contractual obligations and reflects expected payments due as of December 31, 2020 and does not reflect changes that could arise after that date.

Please see the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows on page 65 for a more detailed presentation of the sources and uses of the Company's cash. Critical Accounting Policies In response to the SEC’s Release No. 33-8040, “Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies,” the Company has identified the most critical accounting policies upon which its financial status depends. The Company determined its critical accounting policies by considering those policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments. The Company has identified that its most critical accounting policies are those related to revenue recognition, depreciation, maintenance, repair and refurbishment, impairment of rental equipment and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. Descriptions of these accounting policies are found in both the notes to the consolidated financial statements and at relevant sections in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis. Revenue recognition: Lease revenue - Rental revenues from operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease for all operating segments. Rental billings for periods extending beyond period end are recorded as deferred income and are recognized in the period earned. Rental related services revenues are primarily associated with relocatable modular building and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes leases. For modular building leases, rental related services revenues for modifications, delivery, installation, dismantle and return delivery are lease related because the payments are considered minimum lease payments that are an integral part of the negotiated lease agreement with the customer. These revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain leases are accounted for as sales-type leases. For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment. Other revenues include interest income on sales-type leases and rental income on facility leases. Non-lease revenue - Sales revenue is recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment to customers. Certain leases are accounted for as sales-type leases. For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment. The Company typically recognizes non-lease related revenues at a point in time because the customer does not simultaneously consume the benefits of the Company’s promised goods and services, or performance obligations, and obtain control when delivery and installation are complete. For contracts that have multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in the contract based on the Company’s best estimate of the standalone selling prices of each distinct performance obligation in the contract. The standalone selling price is typically determined based upon the expected cost plus an estimated margin of each performance obligation. Depreciation - The estimated useful lives and estimated residual values used for rental equipment are based on the Company’s experience as to the economic useful life and sale value of its products. Additionally, to the extent information is publicly available, the Company also compares its depreciation policies to other companies with similar rental products for reasonableness. The lives and residual values of rental equipment are subject to periodic evaluation. For modular equipment, external factors to consider may include, but are not limited to, changes in legislation, regulations, building codes, local permitting, and supply or demand. Internal factors for modulars may include, but are not limited to, change in equipment specifications, condition of equipment, or maintenance policies. For electronic test equipment, external factors to consider may include, but are not limited to, technological advances, changes in manufacturers’ selling prices, and supply or demand. Internal factors for electronic test equipment may include, but are not limited to, change in equipment specifications, condition of equipment or maintenance policies. For liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes, external factors to consider may include, but are not limited to, changes in Federal and State legislation, the types of materials stored and the frequency of movements and uses. Internal factors for liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes may include, but are not limited to, change in equipment specifications and maintenance policies. Changes in useful lives or residual values will impact depreciation expense and any gain or loss from the sale of used equipment. Depending on the magnitude of such changes, the impact on the financial statements could be significant. 53 Maintenance, r epair and r efurbishment - Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The direct material and labor costs of value-added additions or major refurbishment of modular buildings are capitalized to the extent the refurbishment significantly improves the quality and adds value or life to the equipment. Judgment is involved as to when these costs should be capitalized. The Company’s policies narrowly limit the capitalization of value-added items to specific additions such as restrooms, sidewalls and ventilation upgrades. In addition, only major refurbishment costs incurred near the end of the estimated useful life of the rental equipment, which extend its useful life, and are subject to certain limitations, are capitalized. Changes in these policies could impact the Company’s financial results. Impairment of rental equipment - The carrying value of the Company’s rental equipment is its capitalized cost less accumulated depreciation. To the extent events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value cannot be recovered, an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carrying value to fair value. The Company determines fair value based upon the condition of the equipment and the projected net cash flows from its rental and sale considering current market conditions. Additionally, if the Company decides to sell or otherwise dispose of the rental equipment, it is carried at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell or dispose. Due to uncertainties inherent in the valuation process and market conditions, it is reasonably possible that actual results of operating and disposing of rental equipment could be materially different than current expectations. Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets - The Company assesses the carrying amount of its recorded goodwill and intangible assets annually or in interim periods if circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. The impairment review is performed by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The evaluation consists of estimating the fair value of the reporting unit based on discounted cash flows using revenue and after tax profit estimates. Management then compares its estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit with the reporting unit’s carrying amount, which includes goodwill and intangible assets. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, then goodwill and intangible assets are not impaired. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit were to exceed its fair value, an impairment loss is recorded for the amount equal to the difference the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value. Impact of Inflation Although the Company cannot precisely determine the effect of inflation, from time to time it has experienced increases in costs of rental equipment, manufacturing costs, operating expenses and interest. Because a majority of its rentals are relatively short-term, the Company has generally been able to pass on such increased costs through increases in rental rates and selling prices, but there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to pass on increased costs to customers in the future. Off Balance Sheet Transactions As of December 31, 2020, the Company did not have any “off-balance-sheet arrangements,” as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. The Company is exposed to cash flow and fair value risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to its 3.68% and 3.84% senior notes due in 2021 and 2022, respectively, and its revolving lines of credit. Weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at December 31, 2020. The estimate of fair value of the Company’s fixed rate debt is based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for bank loans with similar terms and average maturities. The table below presents principal cash flows by expected annual maturities, related weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value for the Company’s Series B and Series C Senior Notes and the Company’s revolving lines of credit under the Credit Facility and Sweep Service Facility as of December 31, 2020.

The Company commenced the closure of its Indian operations during 2017. The Canadian operations of the Company subject it to foreign currency risks (i.e. the possibility that the 54 financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates). Currently, the Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge its economic exposure with respect to assets, liabilities and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In 20 20 , the Company experienced minimal impact on net income due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Although there can be no assurances, given the size of the Canadian operations, the Company does not expect future foreign exchange gains and losses to be significant. The Company has no derivative financial instruments that expose the Company to significant market risk. 55 ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.

The consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles and include amounts based on management’s estimates and judgments. All other financial information in this report has been presented on a basis consistent with the information included in the financial statements. The Company’s management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company maintains a system of internal control that is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliable preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements, as well as to safeguard assets from unauthorized use or disposition. The Company’s system of internal control over financial reporting is embodied in the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. It sets the tone of our organization and includes factors such as integrity and ethical values. Our internal control over financial reporting is supported by formal policies and procedures, which are reviewed, modified and improved as changes occur in business conditions and operations. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed solely of outside directors, meets periodically with members of management and the independent auditors to review and discuss internal control over financial reporting, as well as accounting and financial reporting matters. The independent auditors report to the Audit Committee and accordingly have full and free access to the Audit Committee at any time. The Company’s management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 based on the criteria set forth in the 2013 Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on its evaluation, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2020, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. 57 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Board of Directors and Shareholders McGrath RentCorp Opinion on internal control over financial reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of McGrath RentCorp (a California corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by COSO. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, and our report dated February 23, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP San Jose, California February 23, 2021 58 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Board of Directors and Shareholders McGrath RentCorp Opinion on the financial statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of McGrath RentCorp (a California corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), and our report dated February 23, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion. Basis for opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical audit matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Valuation of TRS-RenTelco rental equipment As described further in Note 1 to the financial statements, the Company evaluates the carrying value of rental equipment for impairment whenever events and circumstances have occurred that would indicate the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. We identified the valuation of the Company’s TRS-RenTelco rental equipment as a critical audit matter. The principal consideration for our determination of the valuation of the TRS-RenTelco rental equipment as a critical audit matter is that the TRS-RenTelco rental equipment can be sensitive to new developments in technology, which creates the risk that equipment could become obsolete or impaired. Management’s impairment analysis relies on estimates of future financial performance of its rental equipment. These estimates include assumptions based upon historical and projected results including utilization, rental pricing and the equipment’s useful life and expected sales proceeds. The failure to achieve these projections might be indicators of potential impairment. Our audit procedures related to the impairment of TRS-RenTelco rental equipment included the following, among others. • We tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls relating to the impairment process, determination of the assumptions, and review of equipment that didn’t meet assumed performance thresholds. • We evaluated the appropriateness of useful lives assigned to the rental equipment. 59 • We analyzed trends in utilization and yield at a disaggregated product level, both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter to evaluate if indicators of impairment were present for any particular product. • For a sample of assets, we inspected underlying documents and compared to the information in management’s analysis for accuracy. • We independently identified any underperforming assets by recalculating management’s analysis performed by using actual margins on sales proceeds. • For assets discussed above, we inquired of management with respect to the assets and factors driving assessment of realizability and corroborated explanations received. /s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Organization McGrath RentCorp and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the “Company”) is a California corporation organized in 1979. The Company is a diversified business to business rental company with four rental divisions; relocatable modular buildings, portable storage containers, electronic test equipment and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes. Although the Company’s primary emphasis is on equipment rentals, sales of equipment occur in the normal course of business. The Company is comprised of four reportable business segments: modular building and portable storage segment (“Mobile Modular”), electronic test equipment segment (“TRS-RenTelco”), containment solutions for the storage of hazardous and non-hazardous liquids and solids segment (“Adler Tanks”) and classroom manufacturing division selling modular classrooms in California (“Enviroplex”). Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of McGrath RentCorp and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Revenue Recognition Lease revenues - Rental revenues from operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease for all operating segments. Rental billings for periods extending beyond period end are recorded as deferred income and are recognized in the period earned. Rental related services revenues are primarily associated with relocatable modular building and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes leases. For modular building leases, rental related services revenues for modifications, delivery, installation, dismantle and return delivery are lease related because the payments are considered minimum lease payments that are an integral part of the negotiated lease agreement with the customer. These revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain leases are accounted for as sales-type leases. For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment. Other revenues include interest income on sales-type leases and rental income on facility leases. Non-lease revenues - Sales revenue is recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment to customers. Certain leases are accounted for as sales-type leases. For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment. Other revenue is recognized when earned and primarily includes interest income on sales-type leases, rental income on facility leases and certain logistics services. Sales taxes charged to customers are reported on a net basis and are excluded from revenues and expenses. Depreciation of Rental Equipment Rental equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis for financial reporting purposes and on an accelerated basis for income tax purposes. The costs of major refurbishment of relocatable modular buildings, portable storage containers and tanks and boxes are capitalized to the extent the refurbishment significantly adds value to, or extends the life of the equipment. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The estimated useful lives and residual values of the Company’s rental equipment used for financial reporting purposes are as follows: Relocatable modular buildings 18 years, 50% residual value Relocatable modular accessories 3 to 18 years, no residual value Blast resistant modules 20 years, no residual value Portable storage containers 25 years, 62.5% residual value Electronic test equipment and accessories 1 to 8 years, no residual value Liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes and accessories 3 to 20 years, no residual value -66- Costs of Rental Related Services Costs of rental related services are primarily associated with relocatable modular building leases and liquid and solid containment tank and boxes. Modular building leases primarily consist of costs for services to be provided under the negotiated lease agreement for delivery, installation, modifications, skirting, additional site-related work, and dismantle and return delivery. Costs related to these services are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Costs of rental related services associated with liquid and solid containment solutions consists of costs of delivery, removal and cleaning of the tanks and boxes. These costs are recognized in the period the service is performed. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company evaluates the carrying value of rental equipment and identifiable definite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances have occurred that would indicate the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. A key element in determining the recoverability of long-lived assets is the Company’s outlook as to the future market conditions for its rental equipment. If the carrying amount is not fully recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carrying amount to fair value. The Company determines fair value based upon the condition of the rental equipment and the projected net cash flows from its rental and sale considering current market conditions. Goodwill and identifiable indefinite lived assets are evaluated for potential impairment annually or when circumstances indicate potential impairment may have occurred. Impairment losses, if any, are determined based upon the excess of carrying value over the estimated fair value of the asset. There were no impairments of long-lived assets during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The Company recorded an impairment of modular rental equipment of $ 0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. Other Direct Costs of Rental Operations Other direct costs of rental operations include direct labor, supplies, repairs, insurance, property taxes, license fees, impairment of rental equipment and certain modular lease costs charged to customers in the negotiated rental rate, which are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Cost of Sales Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income includes the carrying value of the equipment sold and all direct costs associated with the sale. Warranty Reserves Sales of new relocatable modular buildings, portable storage containers, electronic test equipment and related accessories and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes not manufactured by the Company are typically covered by warranties provided by the manufacturer of the products sold. The Company typically provides limited 90 -day warranties for certain sales of used rental equipment and one-year warranties on equipment manufactured by Enviroplex. Although the Company’s policy is to provide reserves for warranties when required for specific circumstances, the Company has not found it necessary to establish such reserves to date as warranty costs have not been significant. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis for financial reporting purposes, and on an accelerated basis for income tax purposes. Depreciation expense for property, plant and equipment is included in “Selling and administrative expenses” and “Rental related services” in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. -67- Property, plant and equipment consist of the following: (dollar amounts in thousands) Estimated useful life December 31, in years 2020 2019 Land Indefinite $ 54,429 $ 54,423 Land improvements 20 – 50 59,249 52,325 Buildings 30 32,306 29,848 Furniture, office equipment and software 3 – 10 36,882 36,610 Vehicles and machinery 5 – 25 43,101 41,877 225,967 215,083 Less accumulated depreciation ( 91,514 ) ( 84,308 ) 134,453 130,775 Construction in progress 1,757 272 $ 136,210 $ 131,047 Property, plant and equipment depreciation expense was $ 8.6 million, $ 8.2 million and $ 8.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Construction in progress at December 31, 2020 and 2019 consisted primarily of costs related to acquisition of land, land improvements and information technology upgrades. Capitalized Software Costs The Company capitalizes certain development costs incurred in connection with its internal use software. Costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as incurred. Once an application has reached the development stage, direct internal and external costs are capitalized until the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. These costs generally include external direct costs of materials and services consumed in the project and internal costs, such as payroll and benefits of those employees directly associated with the development of the software. Maintenance, training and post implementation costs are expensed as incurred. The Company also capitalizes costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality. Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and equipment. The Company capitalized $ 0.1 million and $ 3.0 million in internal use software during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Total advertising expenses were $ 3.9 million, $ 3.6 million and $ 3.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the effect of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are adjusted to the extent necessary to reflect tax rates expected to be in effect when temporary differences reverse. Adjustments may be required to deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities due to changes in tax laws and audit adjustments by tax authorities. A valuation allowance would be established if, based on the weight of available evidence, management believes that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a recorded deferred tax asset would not be realized in future periods. To the extent adjustments are required in any given period, the adjustments would be included within the “Provision for income taxes” in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Purchase prices of acquired businesses are allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based on the estimated fair values on the respective acquisition dates. Based on these values, the excess purchase prices over the fair value of the net assets acquired are allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets. Intangible assets related to customer relationships are amortized over eleven years . At December 31, 2020 and 2019, goodwill and trade name intangible assets which have indefinite lives totaled $ 34.1 million. The Company assesses potential impairment of its goodwill and intangible assets when there is evidence that events or circumstances have occurred that would indicate the recovery of an asset’s carrying value is unlikely. The Company also assesses potential impairment of its goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives on an annual basis regardless of whether there is evidence of impairment. If indicators of impairment were to be present in intangible assets used in operations and future discounted cash flows -68- were not expected to be sufficient to recover the assets’ carrying amount, an impairment loss would be charged to expense in the period identified. The amount of an impairment loss would be recognized as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. Factors the Company considers important, which may cause impairment include, among others, significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired asset, negative industry or economic trends, and significant underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results. The impairment review of the Company’s goodwill is performed by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. The fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value to determine if the goodwill is impaired. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, then goodwill is not impaired. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit were to exceed its fair value, then a goodwill impairment loss is recorded for the amount the reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value. The Company conducted its annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of 2020. The impairment analysis did no t result in an impairment charge for the fiscal year ended 2020. There were no impairment charges in 2019 or 2018. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The Company based its fair value estimates on assumptions that it believes are reasonable but are uncertain and subject to changes in market conditions. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed as net income divided by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is computed assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive securities including the dilutive effects of stock options, unvested restricted stock awards and other potentially dilutive securities. The table below presents the weighted-average common stock used to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share: (in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Weighted-average common stock for calculating basic earnings per share 24,157 24,250 24,141 Effect of potentially dilutive securities from equity-based compensation 374 373 399 Weighted-average common stock for calculating diluted earnings per share 24,531 24,623 24,540 In 2020, 2019 and 2018, there were no shares having an anti-dilutive effect requiring exclusion from the computation of diluted earnings per share. The Company has made purchases of shares of its common stock from time to time in over-the-counter market (NASDAQ) transactions, through privately negotiated, large block transactions and through a share repurchase plan, in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In August 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase up to 2,000,000 shares of the Company's outstanding common stock (the “Repurchase Plan”). The amount and time of the specific repurchases are subject to prevailing market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors, including management’s discretion. All shares repurchased by the Company are canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares of common stock. There can be no assurance that any authorized shares will be repurchased and the Repurchase Plan may be modified, extended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, the company repurchased 282,221 shares of its common stock for an average purchase price of $ 48.25 per share or an aggregate price of $ 13.6 million. There were no repurchases of common stock during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. As of December 31, 2020, 1,309,805 shares remain authorized for repurchase. Accounts Receivable and Concentration of Credit Risk The Company’s accounts receivable consist of amounts due from customers for rentals, sales, financed sales and unbilled amounts for the portion of modular building end-of-lease services earned, which were negotiated as part of the lease agreement. Unbilled receivables related to end-of-lease services, which consists of dismantle and return delivery of buildings, were $ 38.7 million at December 31, 2020 and $ 37.2 million at December 31, 2019. The Company sells primarily on 30 -day terms, individually performs credit evaluation procedures on its customers on each transaction and will require security deposits from its customers when a significant credit risk is identified. The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts in amounts equal to the estimated losses expected to be incurred in the collection of the accounts receivable. The estimated losses are based on historical collection experience in conjunction with an -69- evaluation of the current status of the existing accounts. Customer accounts are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when an account is determined to be uncollectable. The allowance for doubtful accounts activity was as follows: (in thousands) 2020 2019 Beginning balance, January 1 $ 1,883 $ 1,883 Provision for doubtful accounts 1,343 1,013 Write-offs, net of recoveries ( 1,126 ) ( 1,013 ) Ending balance, December 31 $ 2,100 $ 1,883 Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts receivable. From time to time, the Company maintains cash balances in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company believes that the carrying amounts for cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and notes payable approximate their fair values except for fixed rate debt included in notes payable which has an estimated fair value of $ 103.1 million and $ 101.4 million compared to the recorded value of $ 100.0 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The estimates of fair value of the Company’s fixed rate debt are based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for bank loans with similar terms and average maturities. Foreign Currency Transactions and Translation The Company's Canadian subsidiary, TRS-RenTelco Inc., a British Columbia corporation (“TRS-Canada”), functions as a branch sales office for TRS-RenTelco in Canada. The functional currency for TRS-Canada is the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses of TRS-Canada are reported in the results of operations in the period in which they occur. The Company’s Indian subsidiary, TRS-RenTelco India Private Limited (“TRS-India”), functioned as a rental and sales office for TRS-RenTelco in India, which commenced its closure during 2017. The functional currency for TRS-India is the Indian Rupee. All assets and liabilities of TRS-India are translated into U.S. dollars at period-end exchange rates and all income statement amounts are translated at the average exchange rate for each month within the year. Currently, the Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge its economic exposure with respect to assets, liabilities and firm commitments as the foreign currency transactions and risks to date have not been significant. Share-Based Compensation The Company measures and recognizes the compensation expense for all share-based awards made to employees and directors, including stock options, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) and restricted stock units (“RSUs”), based upon estimated fair values. The fair value of stock options and SARs is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and for RSUs based upon the fair market value of the underlying shares of common stock as of the date of grant. The Company recognizes share-based compensation cost ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which generally equals the vesting period. For performance-based RSUs, compensation costs are recognized when vesting conditions are met. In addition, the Company estimates the probable number of shares of common stock that will be earned and the corresponding compensation cost until the achievement of the performance goal is known. The Company recognizes forfeitures based on actual forfeitures when they occur. The Company records share-based compensation costs in “Selling and administrative expenses” in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company recognizes a benefit from share-based compensation in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity if an incremental tax benefit is realized. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in “Note 8 –Benefit Plans”. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions in determining reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each period presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The most significant estimates included in the financial statements are the future cash flows and fair values used to determine the recoverability of the rental equipment and identifiable definite lived intangible assets carrying value, the various assets’ useful lives and residual values, and the allowance for doubtful accounts. -70- NOTE 2. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In December 2019, the FASB issued Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, expected to reduce cost and complexity related to the accounting for income taxes. The ASU removes specific exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 in Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). It eliminates the need for an organization to analyze whether the following apply in a given period: exception to the incremental approach for intra-period tax allocation; exceptions to accounting for basis differences when there are ownership changes in foreign investments; and exception in interim period income tax accounting for year-to-date losses that exceed anticipated losses. The ASU also improves financial statement preparers’ application of income tax-related guidance and simplifies GAAP for: franchise taxes that are partially based on income; transactions with a government that result in a step up in the tax basis of goodwill; separate financial statements of legal entities that are not subject to tax; and enacted changes in tax laws in interim periods. For public business entities, this ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. NOTE 3. IMPLEMENTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Effective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted ASU 2017-04, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment, intended to simplify the subsequent accounting for goodwill acquired in a business combination. Prior guidance required utilizing a two-step process to review goodwill for impairment. A second step was required if there was an indication that an impairment may exist, and the second step required calculating the potential impairment by comparing implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill with the carrying amount of the goodwill. The new guidance eliminates the second step from the goodwill impairment test. Under the new guidance, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount. An entity would recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit's estimated fair value. The adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. The Company adopted ASU 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326) effective January 1, 2020. Under the new guidance, companies are required to present financial assets held at amortized cost and available for sale debt securities net of the amount expected to be collected. The new guidance requires the measurement of expected credit losses to be based on relevant information from past events, including historical experiences, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect collectability. The adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements. Trade accounts receivable The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on the Company’s assessment of the collectability of customer accounts receivable from operating lease and non-lease revenues. The Company regularly reviews the allowance by considering factors such as historical payment experience and trends, the age of the accounts receivable balances, the Company’s operating segment, customer industry, credit quality and current economic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay. The Company recognized bad debt expense of $ 1.3 million, $ 1.0 million and 0.6 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $ 2.1 million, $ 1.9 million and $ 1.9 million at December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Net investment in sales-type leases The Company enters into sales-type leases with certain qualified customers to purchase its rental equipment, primarily at its TRS-RenTelco operating segment. Sales-type leases have terms that generally range from 12 to 36 months and are collateralized by a security interest in the underlying rental asset. The net investment in sales-type leases was $ 1.8 million at December 31, 2020 and $ 2.9 million at December 31, 2019. The Company’s assessment of current expected losses on these receivables was not material and no credit loss expense was provided as of December 31, 2020. The Company regularly reviews the allowance by considering factors such as historical payment experience, the age of the lease receivable balances, credit quality and current economic conditions that may affect a customer's ability to pay. Lease receivables are considered past due 90 days after invoice. The Company manages the credit risk in net investment in sales-type leases, on an ongoing basis, using a number of factors, including, but not limited to the following: historical payment history, credit score, size of operations, length of time in business, industry, historical profitability, historical cash flows, liquidity and past due amounts. The Company uses credit scores obtained from external credit bureaus as a key indicator for the purposes of determining credit quality of its new customers. The Company does not own available for sale debt securities or other financial assets at December 31, 2020. -71- NOTE 4. LEASES Lessee The Company leases real estate for certain of its branch offices and rental equipment storage yards, vehicles and equipment used in its rental operations. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. The Company has leases with lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for separately. Right-Of-Use (“ROU”) assets and liabilities are recognized on the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Variable lease payments are excluded from the ROU assets and lease liabilities and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred, which are not material. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. The Company uses the interest rate stated in the lease as the discount rate. If the interest rate is not stated, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on information available on lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Many of the Company’s real estate lease agreements include options to extend the lease, which are not included in the minimum lease terms unless they are reasonably certain to be exercised. These leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that may extend the lease term from one to three years . The amount of payments associated with such options is not material. Short-term leases are leases having a term of twelve months or less and exclude leases with a lease term of one month or less. The Company recognizes short-term leases on a straight-line basis and does not record a related ROU asset or liability for such leases. At December 31, 2020 and 2019 the Company’s ROU assets and operating lease liabilities was $ 8.3 million and $ 9.9 million, respectively, which are recorded in Prepaid expenses and other assets and Accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the year ended December 31, 2020, operating lease expense was $ 3.8 million, which includes short term lease expense of $ 0.1 million. At December 31, 2020, the weighted-average remaining lease term for operating leases was 3.2 years and the weighted average discount rate was 3.95 %. The Company had no sub-lease income during the year ended December 31, 2020, and did no t have any finance leases as of December 31, 2020. Supplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows: (in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities: Operating cash flows from operating leases $ 3,683 $ 3,568 Right of use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations: Operating leases $ 1,885 $ 2,728 As of December 31, 2020, maturities of operating lease liabilities were as follows: (in thousands) Year ended December 31, 2021 $ 3,294 2022 2,372 2023 1,756 2024 1,066 2025 293 Thereafter — Total lease payments 8,781 Less imputed interest ( 494 ) $ 8,287 Lessor The Company’s equipment rentals for each of its operating segments are governed by agreements that detail the lease terms and conditions. The determination of whether these contracts with customers contain a lease generally does not require significant judgement. The Company accounts for these rentals as operating leases. These leases do not include material amounts of variable payments and the Company has made the accounting policy election to exclude all taxes assessed by a governmental authority. The Company generally does not provide an option for the lessee to purchase the rented equipment at the end of the lease term, thus, does not generate material revenue from sales of equipment under such options. Initial lease terms vary in length based upon customer needs and generally range from one to sixty months . Customers have the option to keep equipment on rent beyond the initial lease term on a month-to month basis based upon their needs. All of the Company’s rental products have long useful lives relative to the typical rental term with the original investment typically recovered in approximately three to five years . The rental products are typically rented for a majority of the time owned and a significant portion of the original investment is recovered when sold from inventory. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants. -72- As of December 31, 2020, maturities of operating lease payments to be received in 2021 and thereafter were as follows: (in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2021 $ 83,482 2022 24,208 2023 7,680 2024 2,741 2025 542 Thereafter 10 $ 118,663 In the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company’s lease revenues were $ 401.9 million, consisting of $ 399.5 of operating lease revenues and $ 2.4 million of finance lease revenues. The Company has entered into finance leases to finance certain equipment sales to customers. The lease agreements have a bargain purchase option at the end of the lease term. For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis, which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company’s finance lease revenues included $ 2.2 million of sales revenues and $ 0.2 million of interest income. The minimum lease payments receivable and the net investment are included in Accounts receivable on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet for such leases, which were as follows: (in thousands) December 31, 2020 Gross minimum lease payments receivable $ 1,953 Less – unearned interest ( 166 ) Net investment in finance lease receivables $ 1,787 As of December 31, 2020, the future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable finance leases to be received in 2021 and thereafter were as follows: (in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2021 $ 1,463 2022 267 2023 49 2024 8 Thereafter — Total minimum future lease payments to be received $ 1,787 NOTE 5. REVENUE RECOGNITION The Company’s accounting for revenues is governed by two accounting standards. The majority of the Company’s revenues are considered lease or lease related and are accounted for in accordance with Topic 840, Leases. Revenues determined to be non-lease related are accounted for in accordance with ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2018. The Company utilized the modified retrospective method of adoption and there was no impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements, nor was there a cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard. The Company accounts for revenues when approval and commitment from both parties have been obtained, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. The Company typically recognizes non-lease related revenues at a point in time because the customer does not simultaneously consume the -73- benefits of the Company’s promised goods and services, or performance obligations, and obtain control when delivery and installation are complete. For contracts that have multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in the contract based on the Company’s best estimate of the standalone selling prices of each distinct performance obligation in the contract. The standalone selling price is typically determined based upon the expected cost plus an estimated margin of each performance obligation. The Company generally rents and sells to customers on 30 day payment terms. The Company does not typically offer variable payment terms, or accept non-monetary consideration. Amounts billed and due from the Company’s customers are classified as Accounts receivable on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. For certain sales of modular buildings, progress payments from the customer are received during the manufacturing of new equipment, or the preparation of used equipment. The advance payments are not considered a significant financing component because the payments are used to meet working capital needs during the contract and to protect the Company from the customer failing to adequately complete their obligations under the contract. These contract liabilities are included in Deferred income on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and totaled $ 11.3 million and $ 17.5 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Sales revenues totaling $ 17.0 million were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020, which were included in the contract liability balance at December 31, 2019. For certain modular building sales, the customer retains a small portion of the contract price until full completion of the contract, which results in revenue earned in excess of billings. These unbilled contract assets are included in Accounts receivable on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets and totaled $ 1.4 million and $ 1.0 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Lease Revenues Rental revenues from operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease for all operating segments. Rental billings for periods extending beyond period end are recorded as deferred income and are recognized in the period earned. Rental related services revenues are primarily associated with relocatable modular building and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes leases. For modular building leases, rental related services revenues for modifications, delivery, installation, dismantle and return delivery are lease related because the payments are considered minimum lease payments that are an integral part of the negotiated lease agreement with the customer. These revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain leases are accounted for as sales-type leases. For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment. Other revenues include interest income on sales-type leases and rental income on facility leases. Non-Lease Revenues Non-lease revenues are recognized in the period when control of the performance obligation is transferred, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services. For liquid and solid containment solutions, portable storage containers and electronic test equipment, rental related services revenues for delivery and return delivery are considered non-lease revenues. Sales revenues are typically recognized at a point in time, which occurs upon the completion of delivery, installation and acceptance of the equipment by the customer. Accounting for non-lease revenues requires judgment in determining the point in time the customer gains control of the equipment and the appropriate accounting period to recognize revenue. Sales taxes charged to customers are reported on a net basis and are excluded from revenues and expenses. -74- The following table disaggregates the Company’s revenues by lease (within the scope of Topic 840) and non-lease revenues (within the scope of Topic 606) and the underlying service provided for the three years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018: (in thousands) Mobile Modular TRS- RenTelco Adler Tanks Enviroplex Consolidated Year Ended December 31, 2020 Leasing $ 235,003 $ 112,210 $ 54,710 $ — $ 401,923 Non-lease: Rental related services 22,576 2,618 21,320 — 46,514 Sales 63,863 24,461 1,386 32,737 122,447 Other 82 1,522 66 — 1,670 Total non-lease 86,521 28,601 22,772 32,737 170,631 Total revenues $ 321,524 $ 140,811 $ 77,482 $ 32,737 $ 572,554 2019 Leasing $ 234,032 $ 108,044 $ 68,917 $ — $ 410,993 Non-lease: Rental related services 18,964 2,599 27,634 — 49,197 Sales 47,045 18,995 1,266 39,814 107,120 Other 969 1,845 106 — 2,920 Total non-lease 66,978 23,439 29,006 39,814 159,237 Total revenues $ 301,010 $ 131,483 $ 97,923 $ 39,814 $ 570,230 2018 Leasing $ 200,214 $ 94,345 $ 70,653 $ — $ 365,212 Non-lease: Rental related services 14,870 2,607 24,276 — 41,753 Sales 39,467 19,895 1,044 29,046 89,452 Other 23 1,810 80 — 1,913 Total non-lease 54,360 24,312 25,400 29,046 133,118 Total revenues $ 254,574 $ 118,657 $ 96,053 $ 29,046 $ 498,330 Customer returns of rental equipment prior to the end of the rental contract term are typically billed a cancellation fee, which is recorded as rental revenue in the period billed. Sales of new relocatable modular buildings, portable storage containers, electronic test equipment and related accessories and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes not manufactured by the Company are typically covered by warranties provided by the manufacturer of the products sold. The Company typically provides limited 90 -day warranties for certain sales of used rental equipment and one-year warranties on equipment manufactured by Enviroplex. Although the Company’s policy is to provide reserves for warranties when required for specific circumstances, the Company has not found it necessary to establish such reserves to date as warranty costs have not been significant. The Company’s incremental cost of obtaining lease contracts, which consists of salesperson commissions, are deferred and amortized over the initial lease term for modular building leases. Incremental costs for obtaining a contract for all other operating segments are expensed in the period incurred because the lease term is typically less than 12 months. -75- NOTE 6.

The Credit Facility provides for a $ 420.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (which may be further increased to $ 670.0 million by adding one or more tranches of term loans and/or increasing the aggregate revolving commitments), which includes a $ 25.0 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a $ 10.0 million sublimit for swingline loans. The proceeds of the Credit Facility are available to be used for general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions. The Credit Facility permits the Company’s existing indebtedness to remain, which includes the Company’s $ 12.0 million Treasury Sweep Note due March 31, 2025 , the Company’s existing senior notes issued pursuant to the Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement with Prudential Investment Management, Inc., dated as of April 21, 2011 (as amended, the “the Prior NPA”): (i) the $ 40.0 million aggregate outstanding principal of notes issued March 17, 2014 and due March 17, 2021 , and (ii) the $ 60.0 million aggregate outstanding principal of notes issued November 5, 2015 and due November 5, 2022 . In addition, the Company may incur additional senior note indebtedness in an aggregate amount not to exceed $ 250.0 million. The Credit Facility matures on March 31, 2025 and replaced the Company’s prior $ 420.0 million credit facility dated March 31, 2016 with Bank of America, N.A., as agent, as amended. All obligations outstanding under the prior credit facility as of the date of the Credit Facility were refinanced by the Credit Facility on March 31, 2020. On March 31, 2020, the Company entered into an amended and restated Credit Facility Letter Agreement and a Credit Line Note in favor of MUFG Union Bank, N.A., which provides for a $ 12.0 million line of credit facility related to its cash management services (“Sweep Service Facility”). The Sweep Service Facility matures on the earlier of March 31, 2025 , or the date the Company ceases to utilize MUFG Union Bank, N.A. for its cash management services. The Sweep Service Facility replaced the Company’s prior $ 12.0 million sweep service facility, dated as of March 31, 2016. At December 31, 2020, under the Credit Facility and Sweep Service Facility, the Company had unsecured lines of credit that permit it to borrow up to $ 432.0 million of which $ 122.8 million was outstanding. The Amended Credit Facility contains financial covenants requiring the Company to not (all defined terms used below not otherwise defined herein have the meaning assigned to such terms in the Amended Credit Facility): • Permit the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges as of the end of any fiscal quarter to be less than 2.50 to 1. At December 31, 2020, the actual ratio was 4.34 to 1. • Permit the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of funded debt to EBITDA at any time during any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters to be greater than 2.75 to 1. At December 31, 2020, the actual ratio was 0.92 to 1. -76- Amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility bear interest at the Company’s option at either: (i) LIBOR plus a defined margin, or (ii) the Agent bank’s prime rate (“base rate”) plus a margin. The applicable margin for each type of loan is measured based upon the Consolidated Leverage Ratio at the end of the prior fiscal quarter and ranges from 1.00 % to 1.75 % for LIBOR loans and 0 % to 0.75 % for base rate loans. In addition, the Company pays an unused commitment fee for the portion of the $ 420.0 million credit facility that is not used. These fees are based upon the Consolidated Leverage Ratio and range from 0.15 % to 0.30 %. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the applicable margins were 1.25 % for LIBOR based loans, 0.25 % for base rate loans and 0.20 % for unused fees. Amounts borrowed under the Sweep Service Facility are based upon the MUFG Union Bank, N.A. base rate plus an applicable margin and an unused commitment fee for the portion of the $ 12.0 million facility not used. The applicable base rate margin and unused commitment fee rates for the Sweep Service Facility are the same as for the Amended Credit Facility. The following information relates to the lines of credit for each of the following periods: (dollar amounts in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2020 2019 Maximum amount outstanding $ 199,471 $ 219,635 Average amount outstanding $ 170,075 $ 201,195 Weighted average interest rate, during the period 2.11 % 3.59 % Prime interest rate, end of period 3.25 % 4.75 % Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement On March 31, 2020, the Company entered into an Amended and Restated Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement (the “Note Purchase Agreement”) with PGIM, Inc. (“PGIM”) and the holders of Series B and Series C Notes previously issued pursuant to the Prior NPA, among the Company and the other parties to the Note Purchase Agreement. The Note Purchase Agreement amended and restated, and superseded in its entirety, the Prior NPA. Pursuant to the Prior NPA, the Company issued (i) $ 40.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.68 % Series B Senior Notes due March 17, 2021 , and (ii) $ 60.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.84 % Series C Senior Notes due November 5, 2022 , to which the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement shall apply. In addition, pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, the Company may authorize the issuance and sale of additional senior notes (the “Shelf Notes”) in the aggregate principal amount of (x) $ 250 million minus (y) the amount of other notes (such as the Series B Senior Notes and Series C Senior Notes, each defined below) then outstanding, to be dated the date of issuance thereof, to mature, in case of each Shelf Note so issued, no more than 15 years after the date of original issuance thereof, to have an average life, in the case of each Shelf Note so issued, of no more than 15 years after the date of original issuance thereof, to bear interest on the unpaid balance thereof from the date thereof at the rate per annum, and to have such other particular terms, as shall be set forth, in the case of each Shelf Note so issued, in accordance with the Note Purchase Agreement. Shelf Notes may be issued and sold from time to time at the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors and in such amounts as the Board of Directors may determine, subject to prospective purchasers’ agreement to purchase the Shelf Notes. The Company will sell the Shelf Notes directly to such purchasers. The full net proceeds of each Shelf Note will be used in the manner described in the applicable Request for Purchase with respect to such Shelf Note. On October 1, 2020, the Company entered into a rate lock agreement with Prudential Private Capital, pursuant to which, the Company agreed to a fixed interest rate of 2.57 % for future issuance, if any, of senior unsecured notes in the aggregate amount of $ 40.0 million with a 7 -year maturity. If issued, the funding for such notes would occur on or before March 17, 2021 and would be subject to the terms and conditions of the Note Purchase Agreement. 3.68% Senior Notes Due in 2021 On March 17, 2014, the Company issued and sold to the purchaser a $ 40.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.68 % Series B Senior Notes (the “Series B Senior Notes”) pursuant to the terms of the Prior NPA. The Series B Senior Notes are an unsecured obligation of the Company and bear interest at a rate of 3.68% per annum and mature on March 17, 2021 . Interest on the Series B Senior Notes is payable semi-annually beginning on September 17, 2014 and continuing thereafter on March 17 and September 17 of each year until maturity. The full net proceeds from the Series B Senior Notes were used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2020, the principal balance outstanding under the Series B Senior Notes was $ 40.0 million. 3.84% Senior Notes Due in 2022 On November 5, 2015, the Company issued and sold to the purchaser a $ 60.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.84 % Series C Senior Notes (the “Series C Senior Notes”) pursuant to the terms of the Prior NPA. The Series C Senior Notes are an unsecured obligation of the Company and bear interest at a rate of 3.84% per annum and mature on November 5, 2022 . Interest on the Series C Senior Notes is payable semi-annually beginning on May 5, 2016 and continuing thereafter on November 5 and May 5 of each year until maturity. The principal balance is due when the notes mature on November 5, 2022. The full net proceeds from the Series C Senior -77- Notes were used to reduce the outstanding balance on the Company’s revolving credit line. At December 31, 2020, the principal balance outstanding under the Series C Senior Notes was $ 60.0 million. Among other restrictions, the Note Purchase Agreement, under which the Series A Senior Notes, Series B Senior Notes and Series C Senior Notes were sold, contains financial covenants requiring the Company to not (all defined terms used below not otherwise defined herein have the meaning assigned to such terms in the Note Purchase Agreement): • Permit the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges as of the end of any fiscal quarter to be less than 2.50 to 1. At December 31, 2020, the actual ratio was 4.34 to 1. • Permit the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of funded debt to EBITDA at any time during any period of four consecutive quarters to be greater than 2.75 to 1. At December 31, 2020, the actual ratio was 0.92 to 1. At December 31, 2020, the Company was in compliance with each of the aforementioned covenants. There are no anticipated trends that the Company is aware of that would indicate non-compliance with these covenants, though, significant deterioration in the Company’s financial performance could impact its ability to comply with these covenants.

Among other provisions, the Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 % to 21 % in 2018, required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and created new taxes on certain foreign-source earnings. As of December 31, 2019, the Company completed its accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the Tax Act without any material adjustments to its previous estimates. As of December 31, 2020, the Company did no t have a deferred tax liability related to its foreign earnings because it did not have any specific plans to repatriate funds from its international subsidiaries. The Company may do so in the future if a dividend can be remitted with no material tax impact. In December 2016, the Company decided to exit the Bangalore, India branch operations of its TRS-RenTelco electronics division. The wind down of operations in India began in 2017. As a result, a valuation allowance was recorded against the deferred tax assets that resulted primarily from accumulated net operating loss carry forwards in India that management estimated the benefit of which will not be realized. As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s foreign net operating losses for tax purposes were $ 0.6 million. If not realized, these carry forwards will begin to expire in 2023 . For income tax purposes, deductible compensation related to share-based awards is based on the value of the award when realized, which may be different than the compensation expense recognized by the company for financial statement purposes which is based on the award value on the date of grant. The difference between the value of the award upon grant, and the value of the award when ultimately realized, creates either additional tax expense or benefit. In 2020, 2019 and 2018 exercise of share-based awards by employees resulted in an excess tax benefit of $ 1.9 million, $ 2.1 million and $ 2.0 million, respectively. The Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. The Company evaluated all of its tax positions for which the statute of limitations remained open and determined there were no material unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. In addition, there have been no material changes in unrecognized benefits during 2020, 2019 and 2018. The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various states and foreign jurisdictions. Tax regulations within each jurisdiction are subject to interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and require the application of significant judgment. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for the years before 2016. Our income tax returns are subject to examination by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. There may be differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations, and as a result, disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of income. -79- The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision (benefit) for income taxes in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income for all periods presented. Such interest and penalties were not significant for the years ended December 31, 20 20 , 201 9 and 201 8 . NOTE 8. BENEFIT PLANS Stock Plans The Company adopted the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2016 Plan”), effective June 8, 2016, under which 2,000,000 shares of the common stock of the Company, plus the number of shares that remain available for grants of awards under the Company's 2007 Stock Option Plan (the “2007 Plan”) and become available as a result of forfeiture, termination, or expiration of awards previously granted under the 2007 Plan, were reserved for the grant of equity awards to its employees, directors and consultants. The equity awards have a maximum term of 7 years at an exercise price of not less than 100 % of the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date the equity award is granted. The 2016 Plan replaced the 2007 Plan. The 2016 Plan provides for the grant of awards in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), the vesting of which may be performance-based or service-based, and other rights and benefits. Each RSU issued reduces the number of shares of the Company’s common stock available for grant under the 2016 Plan by two shares. There were no modifications to the 2016 Plan and no awards classified as liabilities in the year ended December 31, 2020. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the share-based compensation expense was $ 5.5 million, $ 5.9 million and $ 4.1 million, respectively, before provision for income taxes. The Company recorded a tax benefit of approximately $ 1.5 million, $ 1.6 million and $ 1.1 million, respectively, related to the aforementioned share-based compensation expenses. There was no capitalized share-based compensation expense in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Stock Options As of December 31, 2020, a cumulative total of 9,118,500 shares subject to options have been granted with exercise prices ranging from $ 3.47 to $ 40.37 . Of these, options have been exercised for the purchase of 6,378,218 shares, while options for 1,670,972 shares have been terminated, and options for 409,410 shares with exercise prices ranging from $ 24.60 to $ 40.37 remained outstanding under the stock plans. These options vest over five years and expire seven years after grant. To date, no options have been issued to any of the Company’s non-employee advisors. As of December 31, 2020, 1,548,908 shares remained available for issuance of awards under the stock plans. A summary of the Company’s option activity and related information for the three years ended December 31, 2020 is as follows: Number of options Weighted- average price Weighted- average remaining contractual term (in years) Aggregate intrinsic value (in millions) Balance at December 31, 2017 1,208,860 $ 28.14 Options granted — — Options exercised ( 332,810 ) 29.49 Options cancelled/forfeited/expired ( 30,450 ) 28.27 Balance at December 31, 2018 845,600 28.14 Options granted — — Options exercised ( 260,860 ) 29.55 Options cancelled/forfeited/expired ( 4,600 ) 30.59 Balance at December 31, 2019 580,140 29.57 Options granted — — Options exercised ( 163,670 ) 30.22 Options cancelled/forfeited/expired ( 7,060 ) 28.95 Balance at December 31, 2020 409,410 $ 29.33 2.52 $ 15.5 Exercisable at December 31, 2020 309,695 $ 28.45 2.40 $ 12.0 Expected to vest after December 31, 2020 97,645 $ 32.05 2.95 $ 3.4 -80- The intrinsic value of stock options at any point in time is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying awards and the quoted price of the Company’s common stock. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised and sold under the Company’s stock option plans was $ 11.9 million, $ 9.1 million and $ 9.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, determined as of the date of option exercise. As of December 31, 2020, there was approximately $ 0.5 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation option arrangements granted under the Company’s stock plans, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of less than one year . The following table indicates the options outstanding and options exercisable by exercise price with the weighted-average remaining contractual life for the options outstanding and the weighted-average exercise price at December 31, 2020: Options Outstanding Options Exercisable Exercise price Number outstanding at December 31, 2020 Weighted-average remaining contractual life (Years) Weighted-average grant date value Number exercisable at December 31, 2020 Weighted-average grant date value $20 – 25 206,125 2.17 $ 24.60 181,480 $ 24.60 $25 – 30 2,840 2.15 $ 25.12 2,290 $ 25.13 $30 – 35 190,585 2.88 $ 33.97 119,805 $ 33.79 $35 – 40 6,800 3.00 $ 39.19 5,440 $ 39.19 $40 – 45 3,060 3.67 $ 40.37 680 $ 40.37 $20 – 45 409,410 2.52 $ 29.33 309,695 $ 28.45 The Company utilizes the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of share-based compensation at the date of grant, which requires the use of accounting judgment and financial estimates, including estimates of the expected term option holders will retain their vested stock options before exercising them, the estimated volatility of the Company’s stock price over the expected term and the expected number of options that will be forfeited prior to the completion of their vesting requirements. Application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different estimates of the fair value of share-based compensation amounts recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. No options were granted in 2020, 2019 and 2018. Restricted Stock Units The following table summarizes the activity of the Company’s RSUs, which includes service-based and performance-based awards, for the three years ended December 31, 2020: Weighted- Aggregate average intrinsic Number grant date value of shares fair value (in millions) Balance at December 31, 2017 93,664 $ 33.62 RSUs granted 97,260 49.47 RSUs vested ( 30,214 ) 33.16 RSUs cancelled/forfeited/expired ( 21,200 ) 33.88 Balance at December 31, 2018 139,510 44.73 RSUs granted 83,440 59.98 RSUs vested ( 25,862 ) 48.31 RSUs cancelled/forfeited/expired ( 840 ) 59.84 Balance at December 31, 2019 196,248 50.68 RSUs granted 126,540 50.99 RSUs vested ( 89,225 ) 43.42 RSUs cancelled/forfeited/expired ( 7,593 ) 57.93 Balance at December 31, 2020 225,970 $ 57.06 $ 15.2 Performance-based RSUs issued prior to 2018 vest over five years , with 60 % of the shares immediately vesting after three years when the performance criteria has been determined to have been met and 20 % of the remaining shares vesting annually at the anniversary of the performance determination date, subject to continuous employment of the participant. The 2018, 2019 and 2020 performance- -81- based RSU grants vest after three years with 100 % of the shares vesting immediately when performance criteria has been determined to have been met. There were 184,091 performance-based RSUs expected to vest as of December 31, 20 20 . Service based RSUs issued to the Company’s directors generally vest over twelve to fourteen months . Service based RSUs issued to the Company’s management vest over three years. There were 93,040 service-based RSUs expected to vest as of December 31, 20 20 . No forfeitures are currently expected. The total fair value of RSUs that vested during the years ended December 31, 20 20 , 201 9 and 201 8 based on the weighted average grant date values was $ 3.9 million, $ 1.2 million and $ 1.0 million, respectively. Share-based compensation expense for RSUs for the year ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $ 4.6 million, $ 4.7 million and $ 2.6 , respectively. As of December 31, 2020, the total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSUs was $ 7.0 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.6 years. Employee Stock Ownership and 401(k) Plans The McGrath RentCorp Employee Stock Ownership and 401(k) Plan (the “KSOP”) provides that each participant may annually contribute an elected percentage of his or her salary, not to exceed the statutory limit. Each employee who has at least three months of service with the Company and is 21 years or older, is eligible to participate in the KSOP. The Company, at its discretion, may make matching contributions. Contributions are expensed in the year approved by the Board of Directors. Dividends on the Company’s stock held by the KSOP are treated as ordinary dividends and, in accordance with existing tax laws, are deducted by the Company in the year paid. For the year ended December 31, 2020 dividends deducted by the Company were $ 0.4 million, which resulted in a tax benefit of approximately $ 0.1 million in 2020. At December 31, 2020, the KSOP held 240,187 shares, or 1 % of the Company’s total common shares outstanding. These shares are included in basic and diluted earnings per share calculations. NOTE 9. SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY The Company has in the past made purchases of shares of its common stock from time to time in over-the-counter market (NASDAQ) transactions, through privately negotiated, large block transactions and through a share repurchase plan, in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In August 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase 2,000,000 shares of the Company's outstanding common stock (the “Repurchase Plan”). The amount and time of the specific repurchases are subject to prevailing market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors, including management’s discretion. All shares repurchased by the Company are canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares of common stock. There can be no assurance that any authorized shares will be repurchased and the repurchase program may be modified, extended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. There were 282,221 shares of common stock repurchased during the twelve months ended December 31, 2020 for the aggregate purchase price of $ 13.6 million or an average price of $ 48.25 per repurchased share. There were no repurchases of common stock during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, 1,309,805 shares remain authorized for repurchase under the Repurchase Plan. NOTE 10. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company leases certain facilities under various operating leases. Most of the lease agreements provide the Company with the option of renewing its lease at the end of the lease term, at the fair rental value. In most cases, management expects that in the normal course of business, facility leases will be renewed or replaced by other leases. Minimum payments under these leases, exclusive of property taxes and insurance, are as follows: (in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2021 $ 2,334 2022 1,718 2023 1,356 2024 1,005 2025 293 Thereafter — $ 6,706 Facility rent expense was $ 3.7 million in 2020, $ 3.9 million in 2019 and $ 3.5 million in 2018. -82- The Company is involved in various lawsuits and routine claims arising out of the normal course of its business. The Company maintains insurance coverage for its operations and employees with appropriate aggregate, per occurrence and deductible limits as the Company reasonably determines necessary or prudent with current operations and historical experience. The major policies include coverage for property, general liability, auto, directors and officers, health, and workers’ compensation insurances. The Company records a provision for a liability when it believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. The Company reviews these provisions at least quarterly and adjusts these provisions to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Litigation is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Company’s control. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility that the ultimate amount of liability not covered by insurance, if any, under any pending litigation and claims, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the financial position or operating results of the Company. The Company’s health plans are self-funded high deductible plans with annual stop-loss insurance of $ 200,000 per claim. Beginning in 2019, the Company’s workers compensation insurance is underwritten by an insurance company with no stop-loss value and $ 350,000 for prior claim years. Insurance providers are responsible for making claim payments that exceed these amounts on an individual claim basis. In addition, the Company has stop loss insurance that pays for claim payments made during a twelve month coverage period that exceeds certain specified thresholds in the aggregate. The Company records an expense when health and workers compensation claim payments are made and accrues for the portion of claims incurred, but not yet paid at period end. The Company makes these accruals based upon a combination of historical claim payments, loss development experience and actuarial estimates. A high degree of judgment is required in developing the underlying assumptions and the resulting amounts to be accrued. In addition, our assumptions will change as the Company’s loss experience develops. All of these factors have the potential for impacting the amounts previously accrued and the Company may be required to increase or decrease the amounts previously accrued. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, accruals for the Company’s health and workers’ compensation high deductible plans were $ 2.2 million and $ 2.8 million, respectively. NOTE 11. INTANGIBLE ASSETS Intangible assets consist of the following: (dollar amounts in thousands) Estimated useful life in years December 31, 2020 December 31, 2019 Trade name Indefinite $ 5,871 $ 5,871 Customer relationships 11 10,644 10,644 Non-compete agreements 5 157 157 16,672 16,672 Less accumulated amortization ( 9,554 ) ( 9,338 ) $ 7,118 $ 7,334 Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their respective useful lives. Amortization expense in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $ 0.2 million, $ 0.9 million and $ 0.9 million, respectively. Based on the carrying values at December 31, 2020 and assuming no subsequent impairment of the underlying assets, the annual amortization is expected to be $ 0.2 million in 2021 and $ 0.2 million in 2022 through 2026. NOTE 12. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS There were no related party transactions in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, or amounts owed to related parties at such dates. -83- NOTE 13. SEGMENT REPORTING FASB guidelines establish annual and interim reporting standards for an enterprise’s operating segments and related disclosures about its products, services, geographic areas and major customers. In accordance with these guidelines the Company’s four reportable segments are Mobile Modular, TRS-RenTelco, Adler Tanks and Enviroplex. Management focuses on several key measures to evaluate and assess each segment’s performance including rental revenue growth, gross margin, and income before provision for income taxes. Excluding interest expense, allocations of revenue and expense not directly associated with one of these segments are generally allocated to Mobile Modular, TRS-RenTelco and Adler Tanks, based on their pro-rata share of direct revenues. Interest expense is allocated amongst Mobile Modular, TRS-RenTelco and Adler Tanks based on their pro-rata share of average rental equipment at cost, goodwill, intangible assets, accounts receivable, deferred income and customer security deposits. The Company does not report total assets by business segment. Summarized financial information for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, for the Company’s reportable segments is shown in the following tables: (dollar amounts in thousands) Mobile Modular TRS- RenTelco Adler Tanks Enviroplex 1 Consolidated Year Ended December 31, 2020 Rental revenues $ 188,719 $ 109,083 $ 53,988 $ — $ 351,790 Rental related services revenues 67,527 3,080 21,786 — 92,393 Sales and other revenues 65,278 28,648 1,708 32,737 128,371 Total revenues 321,524 140,811 77,482 32,737 572,554 Depreciation of rental equipment 22,967 46,472 16,427 — 85,866 Gross profit 155,874 60,864 34,079 12,929 263,746 Selling and administrative expenses 68,470 24,306 24,764 5,453 122,993 Income from operations 87,404 36,558 9,315 7,476 140,753 Interest expense (income) allocation 5,104 2,133 2,107 ( 557 ) 8,787 Income before provision for income taxes 82,300 34,503 7,208 8,033 132,044 Rental equipment acquisitions 39,078 42,588 2,541 — 84,207 Accounts receivable, net (period end) 81,640 22,735 13,655 5,286 123,316 Rental equipment, at cost (period end) 882,115 333,020 315,706 — 1,530,841 Rental equipment, net book value (period end) 611,590 156,536 169,990 — 938,116 Utilization (period end) 2 76.0 % 67.4 % 39.8 % Average utilization 2 77.2 % 66.2 % 44.6 % -84- Segment Data (Continued) (dollar amounts in thousands) Mobile Modular TRS- RenTelco Adler Tanks Enviroplex 1 Consolidated Year Ended December 31, 2019 Rental revenues $ 182,316 $ 103,704 $ 67,869 $ — $ 353,889 Rental related services revenues 69,395 3,260 28,383 — 101,038 Sales and other revenues 49,299 24,519 1,671 39,814 115,303 Total revenues 301,010 131,483 97,923 39,814 570,230 Depreciation of rental equipment 22,071 41,948 16,372 — 80,391 Gross profit 143,618 60,748 47,014 14,785 266,165 Selling and administrative expenses 65,699 24,645 29,321 5,128 124,793 Income from operations 77,919 36,103 17,693 9,657 141,372 Interest expense (income) allocation 7,946 1,970 3,436 ( 1,021 ) 12,331 Income before benefit for income taxes 69,973 34,217 14,257 10,678 129,125 Rental equipment acquisitions 75,433 89,759 4,826 — 170,018 Accounts receivable, net (period end) 83,182 23,788 17,281 3,848 128,099 Rental equipment, at cost (period end) 868,807 335,343 316,261 — 1,520,411 Rental equipment, net book value (period end) 610,048 172,413 185,039 — 967,500 Utilization (period end) 2 79.1 % 64.5 % 48.4 % Average utilization 2 79.2 % 66.2 % 54.7 % 2018 Rental revenues $ 159,136 $ 89,937 $ 69,701 $ — $ 318,774 Rental related services revenues 54,696 3,300 24,911 — 82,907 Sales and other revenues 40,742 25,420 1,441 29,046 96,649 Total revenues 254,574 118,657 96,053 29,046 498,330 Depreciation of rental equipment 21,200 36,011 15,928 — 73,139 Gross profit 120,750 54,773 48,055 9,673 233,251 Selling and administrative expenses 58,017 22,823 30,026 4,904 115,770 Income from operations 62,733 31,950 18,029 4,769 117,481 Interest expense (income) allocation 7,132 2,696 3,252 ( 783 ) 12,297 Income before benefit for income taxes 55,601 28,765 14,777 5,552 104,695 Rental equipment acquisitions 63,374 65,467 5,257 — 134,098 Accounts receivable, net (period end) 72,295 20,732 19,992 7,997 121,016 Rental equipment, at cost (period end) 817,375 285,052 313,573 — 1,416,000 Rental equipment, net book value (period end) 572,032 131,450 197,533 — 901,015 Utilization (period end) 2 79.3 % 62.1 % 56.4 % Average utilization 2 78.2 % 62.7 % 59.9 % 1 Gross Enviroplex sales revenues were $ 34,014 , $ 39,814 and $ 30,407 in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. There were $ 1,277 and $ 1,361 inter-segment sales to Mobile Modular in 2020 and 2018, which have been eliminated in consolidation. There were no inter-segment sales in 2019. 2 Utilization is calculated each month by dividing the cost of rental equipment on rent by the total cost of rental equipment excluding new equipment inventory and accessory equipment. The average utilization for the period is calculated using the average costs of rental equipment. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues during 2020, 2019 and 2018. Revenue from foreign country customers accounted for 4 %, 5 % and 4 % of the Company’s revenues for the same periods, respectively. -85- NOTE 14.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE. None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Company’s management under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in rules promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) for the Company. Based on their evaluation the CEO and CFO have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2020. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. During the last quarter of the Company’s fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and the CEO and CFO have concluded that these controls and procedures are effective at the “reasonable assurance” level. Management’s Assessment of Internal Control. Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, is discussed in the Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting included on page 57. The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited by Grant Thornton LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, and its report is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS. General Overview McGrath RentCorp (the “Company”) is a California corporation organized in 1979 with corporate offices located in Livermore, California. The Company’s common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “MGRC”. References in this report to the “Company”, “we”, “us”, and “ours” refer to McGrath RentCorp and its subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise. The Company is a diversified business-to-business rental company with four rental divisions: relocatable modular buildings, portable storage containers, electronic test equipment, and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes. Although the Company’s primary emphasis is on equipment rentals, sales of equipment occur in the normal course of business. The Company is comprised of four reportable business segments: (1) its modular building and portable storage segment (“Mobile Modular”); (2) its electronic test equipment segment (“TRS-RenTelco”); (3) its containment solutions for the storage of hazardous and non-hazardous liquids and solids segment (“Adler Tanks”); and (4) its classroom manufacturing business selling modular buildings used primarily as classrooms in California (“Enviroplex”). No single customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues during 2019, 2018 and 2017. Revenue from foreign country customers accounted for 5%, 4% and 4% of the Company’s revenues in 2019 and 2018, and 2017, respectively. Business Model The Company invests capital in rental products and generally has recovered its original investment through rents less cash operating expenses in a relatively short period of time compared to the product’s rental life. When the Company’s rental products are sold, the proceeds generally have covered a high percentage of the original investment. With these characteristics, a significant base of rental assets on rent generates a considerable amount of operating cash flows to support continued rental asset growth. The Company’s rental products have the following characteristics: • The product required by the customer tends to be expensive compared to the Company’s monthly rental charge, with the interim rental solution typically evaluated as a less costly alternative. • Generally, we believe the Company’s customers have a short-term need for our rental products. The customer’s rental requirement may be driven by a number of factors including time, budget or capital constraints, future uncertainty impacting their ongoing requirements, equipment availability, specific project requirements, peak periods of demand or the customer may want to eliminate the burdens and risks of ownership. 2 • All of the Company’s rental products have long useful lives relative to the typical rental term. Modular buildings (“modulars”) have an estimated life of eighteen years compared to the typical rental term of twelve to twenty-four months, electronic test equipment has an estimated life range of one to eight years (depending on the type of product) compared to a typical rental term of one to six months, and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes have an estimated life of twenty years compared to typical rental terms of one to six months. • We believe short-term rental rates typically recover the Company’s original investment quickly based on the respective product’s annual yield, or annual rental revenues divided by the average cost of rental equipment. For modulars the original investment is recovered in approximately five years, in approximately three years for electronic test equipment and in approximately four years for liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes. • When a product is sold from our rental inventory, a significant portion of the original investment is usually recovered. Effective asset management is a critical element to each of the rental businesses and the residuals realized when product is sold from inventory. Modular asset management requires designing and building the product for a long life, coupled with ongoing repair and maintenance investments, to ensure its long useful rental life and generally higher residuals upon sale. Electronic test equipment asset management requires understanding, selecting and investing in equipment technologies that support market demand and, once invested, proactively managing the equipment at the model level for optimum utilization through its technology life cycle to maximize the rental revenues and residuals realized. Liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes asset management requires selecting and purchasing quality product and making ongoing repair and maintenance investments to ensure its long rental life. The Company believes that rental revenue growth from an increasing base of rental assets and improved gross profits on rents are the best measures of the health of each of our rental businesses. Additionally, we believe our business model and results are enhanced by operational leverage that is created from large regional sales and inventory centers for modulars, a single U.S. based sales, inventory and operations facility for electronic test equipment, as well as shared senior management and back office functions for financing, human resources, insurance, marketing, information technology and operating and accounting systems. Employees As of December 31, 2019, the Company had 1,099 employees, of whom 91 were primarily administrative and executive personnel, with 597, 186, 136 and 89 in the operations of Mobile Modular, Adler Tanks, TRS-RenTelco and Enviroplex, respectively. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and management believes its relationship with our employees is good.

Modulars vary from simple single-unit construction site offices to multi-floor modular complexes. The Company’s modular rental fleet includes a full range of styles and sizes. The Company considers its modulars to be among the most attractive and well-designed available. The units are constructed with wood or metal siding, sturdily built and physically capable of a long useful life. Modulars are generally provided with installed heat, air conditioning, lighting, electrical outlets and floor covering, and may have customized interiors including partitioning, cabinetry and plumbing facilities. Mobile Modular purchases new modulars from various manufacturers who build to Mobile Modular’s design specifications. During 2019, Mobile Modular purchased 27% of its modular units from one manufacturer. The Company believes that the loss of any of its primary modular manufacturers could have an adverse effect on its operations since Mobile Modular could experience higher prices and longer lead times for delivery of modular units until other manufacturers were able to increase their production capacity. The Company’s modulars are manufactured to comply with state building codes, have a low risk of obsolescence, and can be modified or reconfigured to accommodate a wide variety of customer needs. Historically, as state building codes have changed over the years, Mobile Modular has been able to continue to use existing modulars, with minimal, if any, required upgrades. The Company has no assurance that it will continue to be able to use existing modular equipment with minimal upgrades as building codes change in the future. Mobile Modular currently operates from regional sales and inventory centers in California, Texas, Florida and Georgia, serving large geographic areas in these states, and sales offices serving Louisiana, North Carolina, Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C. The California, Texas, Florida and Georgia regional sales and inventory centers have in-house infrastructure and operational capabilities to support quick and efficient repair, modification, and refurbishment of equipment for the next rental opportunity. The Company believes operating from large regional sales and inventory centers results in better operating margins as operating costs can be spread over a large installed customer base. Mobile Modular actively maintains and repairs its rental equipment, and management believes this ensures the continued use of the modular product over its long life and, when sold, has resulted in higher sale proceeds relative to its capitalized cost. When rental equipment returns from a customer, the necessary repairs and preventative maintenance are performed prior to its next rental. By making these expenditures for repair and maintenance throughout the equipment’s life we believe that older equipment can generally rent for rates similar to those of newer equipment. Management believes the condition of the equipment is a more significant factor in determining the rental rate and sale price than its age. Over the last three years, used equipment sold each year represented approximately 2% of rental equipment, and has been, on average, 15 years old with sale proceeds above its net book value. Competitive Strengths Market Leadership – The Company believes Mobile Modular is the largest supplier in California, and a significant supplier in Florida and Texas, of modular educational facilities for rental to both public and private schools. Management is knowledgeable about the needs of its educational customers and the related regulatory requirements in the states where Mobile Modular operates, which enables Mobile Modular to meet its customers’ specific project requirements. Expertise – The Company believes that over the 40 years during which Mobile Modular has competed in the modular rental industry, it has developed expertise that differentiates it from its competitors. Mobile Modular has dedicated its attention to continuously developing and improving the quality of its modular units. Mobile Modular has expertise in the licensing and regulatory requirements that govern modulars in the states where it operates, and its management, sales and operational staffs are knowledgeable and committed to providing exemplary customer service. Mobile Modular has expertise in project management and complex applications. Operating Structure – Part of the Company’s strategy for Mobile Modular is to create facilities and infrastructure capabilities that its competitors cannot easily duplicate. Mobile Modular achieves this by building regional sales and inventory centers designed to serve a broad geographic area and a large installed customer base under a single overhead structure, thereby reducing its cost per transaction. The Company’s regional facilities and related infrastructure enable Mobile Modular to maximize its modular inventory utilization through efficient and cost effective in-house repair, maintenance and refurbishment for quick redeployment of equipment to meet its customers’ needs. Asset Management – The Company believes Mobile Modular markets high quality, well-constructed and attractive modulars. Mobile Modular requires manufacturers to build to its specifications, which enables Mobile Modular to maintain a standardized 4 quality fleet. In addition, through its ongoing repair, refurbishment and maintenance programs, the Company believes Mobile Modular’s buildings are the best maintained in the industry. The Company depreciates its modular buildings over an 18 year estimated useful life to a 50% residual value. Older buildings continue to be productive primarily because of Mobile Modular’s focus on ongoing fleet maintenance. Also, as a result of Mobile Modular’s maintenance programs, when a modular unit is sold, a high percentage of the equipment’s capitalized cost is recovered. In addition, the fleet’s utilization is regionally optimized by managing inventory through estimates of market demand, fulfillment of current rental and sale order activity, modular returns and capital purchases. Customer Service - The Company believes the modular rental industry to be service intensive and locally based. The Company strives to provide excellent service by meeting its commitments to its customers, being proactive in resolving project issues and seeking to continuously improve the customers’ experience. Mobile Modular is committed to offering quick response to requests for information, providing experienced assistance, on time delivery and preventative maintenance of its units. Mobile Modular’s goal is to continuously improve its procedures, processes and computer systems to enhance internal operational efficiency. The Company believes this dedication to customer service results in high levels of customer loyalty and repeat business. Market Management estimates relocatable modular building rental is an industry that today has equipment on rent or available for rent in the U.S. with an aggregate original cost of over $5.0 billion. Mobile Modular’s largest market segment is for temporary classroom and other educational space needs of public and private schools, colleges and universities in California and Florida, and to a lesser extent in Texas, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C. Management believes the demand for rental classrooms is caused by shifting and fluctuating school populations, the limited state funds for new construction, the need for temporary classroom space during reconstruction of older schools, class size reduction and the phasing out of portable classrooms compliant with older building codes (see “Classroom Rentals and Sales to Public Schools (K-12)” below). Other customer applications include sales offices, construction field offices, health care facilities, church sanctuaries and child care facilities. Industrial, manufacturing, entertainment and utility companies, as well as governmental agencies commonly use large multi-modular complexes to serve their interim administrative and operational space needs. Modulars offer customers quick, cost-effective space solutions while conserving their capital. The Company’s corporate offices, and California, Texas, Florida and Georgia regional sales and inventory center offices are housed in various sizes of modular units. Since most of Mobile Modular’s customer requirements are to fill temporary space needs, Mobile Modular’s marketing emphasis is on rentals rather than sales. Mobile Modular attracts customers through its website at www.mobilemodular.com, internet advertising and direct marketing. Customers are encouraged to visit a regional sales and inventory center to view different models on display and to see a regional office, which is a working example of a modular application. Because service is a major competitive factor in the rental of modulars, Mobile Modular offers quick response to requests for information, assistance in the choice of a suitable size and floor plan, in-house customization services, rapid delivery, timely installation and field service of its units. On Mobile Modular’s website, customers are able to view and select inventory for quotation and request in-field service. Rentals Rental periods range from one month to several years with a typical initial contract term between twelve and twenty-four months. In general, monthly rental rates are determined by a number of factors including length of term, market demand, product availability and product type. Upon expiration of the initial term, or any extensions, rental rates are reviewed, and when appropriate, are adjusted based on current market conditions. Most rental agreements are operating leases that provide no purchase options, and when a rental agreement does provide the customer with a purchase option, it is generally on terms management believes to be attractive to Mobile Modular. The customer is responsible for obtaining the necessary use permits and for the costs of insuring the unit, and is financially responsible for transporting the unit to the site, preparation of the site, installation of the unit, dismantle and return delivery of the unit to Mobile Modular, and certain costs for customization. Mobile Modular maintains the units in good working condition while on rent. Upon return, the units are inspected for damage and customers are billed for items considered beyond normal wear and tear. Generally, the units are then repaired for subsequent use. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred and can include floor repairs, roof maintenance, cleaning, painting and other cosmetic repairs. The costs of major refurbishment of equipment are capitalized to the extent the refurbishment significantly improves the quality and adds value or life to the equipment. At December 31, 2019, Mobile Modular owned 56,207 new or previously rented modulars and portable storage containers with an aggregate cost of $868.8 million including accessories, or an average cost per unit of $15,457. Utilization is calculated at the end of each month by dividing the cost of rental equipment on rent by the total cost of rental equipment, excluding new equipment 5 inventory and accessory equipment. At December 31, 201 9 , fleet utilization was 79.1 % and average fleet utilization during 201 9 was 79.2 %. The Mobile Modular segment includes the results of operations of Mobile Modular Portable Storage, which represented approximately 8 % of the Company’s 201 9 total revenues. Sales In addition to operating its rental fleet, Mobile Modular sells modulars to customers. These sales typically arise out of its marketing efforts for the rental fleet and from existing equipment already on rent. Such sales can be of either new or used units from the rental fleet, which permits some turnover of older units. During 2019 Mobile Modular’s largest sale represented approximately 7% of Mobile Modular’s sales, 3% of the Company’s consolidated sales and less than 1% of the Company’s consolidated revenues. Mobile Modular typically provides limited 90-day warranties on used modulars and passes through the manufacturers’ one-year warranty on new units to its customers. Warranty costs have not been significant to Mobile Modular’s operations to date, and the Company attributes this to its commitment to high quality standards and regular maintenance programs. However, there can be no assurance that warranty costs will continue to be insignificant to Mobile Modular’s operations in the future. Enviroplex manufactures portable classrooms built to the requirements of the California Division of the State Architect (“DSA”) and sells directly to California public school districts and other educational institutions. Seasonality Typically, during each calendar year, our highest numbers of classrooms are shipped for rental and sale orders during the second and third quarters for delivery and installation prior to the start of the upcoming school year. The majority of classrooms shipped in the second and third quarters have rental start dates during the third quarter, thereby making the fourth quarter the first full quarter of rental revenues recognized for these transactions. Competition Competition in the rental and sale of relocatable modular buildings is intense. Some of our competitors in the modular building leasing industry, notably WillScot Corporation, have a greater range of products and services, greater financial and marketing resources, larger customer bases, and greater name recognition than we have. In addition, a number of other smaller companies operate regionally throughout the country. Mobile Modular operates primarily in California, Texas, Florida, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, Maryland and Washington, D.C. Significant competitive factors in the rental business include availability, price, service, reliability, appearance and functionality of the product. Mobile Modular markets high quality, well-constructed and attractive modulars. Part of the Company’s strategy for modulars is to create facilities and infrastructure capabilities that its competitors cannot easily duplicate. The Company's facilities and related infrastructure enable it to modify modulars efficiently and cost effectively to meet its customers’ needs. Management's goal is to be more responsive at less expense. Management believes this strategy, together with its emphasis on prompt and efficient customer service, gives Mobile Modular a competitive advantage. Mobile Modular is determined to respond quickly to requests for information, and provide experienced assistance for the first-time user, rapid delivery and timely repair of its modular units. Mobile Modular’s already high level of efficiency and responsiveness continues to improve as the Company upgrades procedures, processes and computer systems that control its internal operations. The Company anticipates intense competition to continue and believes it must continue to improve its products and services to remain competitive in the market for modulars. Classroom Rentals and Sales to Public Schools (K-12) Mobile Modular and Enviroplex provide classroom and specialty space needs serving public and private schools, colleges and universities. Within the educational market, the rental (by Mobile Modular) and sale (by Enviroplex and Mobile Modular) of modulars to public school districts for use as portable classrooms, restroom buildings and administrative offices for kindergarten through grade twelve (K-12) are a significant portion of the Company’s revenues. Mobile Modular rents and sells classrooms in California, Florida, Texas, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C. Enviroplex sells classrooms in the California market. California is Mobile Modular’s largest educational market. Historically, demand in this market has been fueled by shifting and fluctuating student populations, insufficient funding for new school construction, class size reduction programs, modernization of aging school facilities and the phasing out of portable classrooms no longer compliant with current building codes. The following table shows the approximate percentages of the Company’s modular rental and sales revenues, and of its consolidated rental and sales revenues for the past five years, that rentals and sales to these schools constitute: 6 Rentals and Sales to Public Schools (K-12) as a Percentage of Total Rental and Sales Revenues Percentage of: 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 Modular Rental Revenues (Mobile Modular) 32% 33% 33% 34% 33% Modular Sales Revenues (Mobile Modular & Enviroplex) 64% 70% 76% 67% 43% Modular Rental and Sales Revenues (Mobile Modular & Enviroplex) 42% 44% 47% 43% 35% Consolidated Rental and Sales Revenues 1 25% 24% 26% 23% 16% 1 Consolidated Rental and Sales Revenue percentage is calculated by dividing Modular rental and sales revenues to public schools (K-12) by the Company’s consolidated rental and sales revenues. School Facility Funding Funding for public school facilities is derived from a variety of sources including the passage of both statewide and local facility bond measures, operating budgets, developer fees, various taxes including parcel and sales taxes levied to support school operating budgets, and lottery funds. There is no certainty on the timing of the bond sales and it could take additional years before projects funded by these bonds generate meaningful demand for relocatable classrooms. 7 ELECTRONIC TEST EQUIPMENT Description TRS-RenTelco rents and sells electronic test equipment nationally and internationally from two facilities located in Grapevine, Texas (the “Dallas facility”) and Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Canada (the “Montreal facility”). TRS-RenTelco’s revenues are derived from the rental and sale of general purpose and communications test equipment to a broad range of companies, from Fortune 500 to middle and smaller market companies, in the aerospace, defense, communications, manufacturing and semiconductor industries. Electronic test equipment revenues are primarily affected by the business activity within these industries related to research and development, manufacturing, and communication infrastructure installation and maintenance. The Dallas facility, TRS-RenTelco’s primary operating location, houses the electronic test equipment inventory, sales engineers, calibration laboratories, and operations staff for U.S. and international business. The Montreal facility houses sales engineers and operations staff to serve the Canadian market. As of December 31, 2019, the original cost of electronic test equipment inventory was comprised of 77% general purpose electronic test equipment and 23% communications electronic test equipment. Engineers, technicians and scientists utilize general purpose electronic test equipment in developing products, controlling manufacturing processes, completing field service applications and evaluating the performance of their own electrical and electronic equipment. These instruments are rented primarily to aerospace, defense, electronics, industrial, research and semiconductor industries. To date, Keysight Technologies, Rhode & Schwarz and Tektronix, a division of Fortive Corporation, have manufactured the majority of TRS-RenTelco’s general purpose electronic test equipment with the remainder acquired from over 60 other manufacturers. Communications test equipment, including fiber optic test equipment, is utilized by technicians, engineers and installation contractors to evaluate voice, data and multimedia communications networks, to install fiber optic cabling, and in the development and manufacturing of transmission, network and wireless products. These instruments are rented primarily to manufacturers of communications equipment and products, electrical and communications installation contractors, field technicians, and service providers. To date, Anritsu, Viavi Solutions and Fluke Networks, a division of Fortive Corporation, have manufactured a significant portion of TRS-RenTelco’s communications test equipment, with the remainder acquired from over 40 other manufacturers. TRS-RenTelco’s general purpose test equipment rental inventory includes oscilloscopes, amplifiers, analyzers (spectrum, network and logic), signal source and power source test equipment. The communications test equipment rental inventory includes network and transmission test equipment for various fiber, copper and wireless networks. TRS-RenTelco occasionally rents electronic test equipment from other rental companies and re-rents the equipment to customers. Competitive Strengths Market Leadership - The Company believes that TRS-RenTelco is one of the largest electronic test equipment rental and leasing companies offering a broad and deep selection of general purpose and communications test equipment for rent in North America. Expertise - The Company believes that its knowledge of products, technology and applications expertise provides it with a competitive advantage over others in the industry. Customer requirements are supported by application engineers and technicians that are knowledgeable about the equipment’s uses to ensure the right equipment is selected to meet the customer’s needs. This knowledge can be attributed to the experience of TRS-RenTelco’s management, sales and operational teams. Operating Structure - TRS-RenTelco is supported by a centralized distribution and inventory center on the grounds of the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport in Texas. The Company believes that the centralization of servicing all customers in North America and internationally by TRS-RenTelco’s experienced logistics teams provides a competitive advantage by minimizing transaction costs and enabling TRS-RenTelco to ensure customer requirements are met. Asset Management - TRS-RenTelco’s rental equipment inventory is serviced by an ISO 9001-2015 registered and compliant calibration laboratory that repairs and calibrates equipment ensuring that off rent equipment is ready to ship immediately to meet customers’ needs. TRS-RenTelco’s team of technicians, product managers and sales personnel are continuously monitoring and analyzing the utilization of existing products, new technologies, general economic conditions and estimates of customer demand to ensure the right equipment is purchased and sold, at the right point in the equipment’s technology life cycle. The Company believes this enables it to maximize utilization of equipment and the cash flow generated by the rental and sales revenue of each model of equipment. TRS-RenTelco strives to maintain strong relationships with equipment manufacturers, which enables it to leverage those relationships to gain rental opportunities. Customer Service - The Company believes that its focus on providing excellent service to its customers provides a competitive advantage. TRS-RenTelco strives to provide exemplary service to fulfill its commitments to its customers. TRS-RenTelco prides 8 itself in providing solutions to meet customers’ needs by having equipment available and responding quickly and thoroughly to their requests. TRS-RenTelco’s sophisticated in-house laboratory ensures the equipment is fully functional and meets its customers’ delivery requirements. Service needs of TRS-RenTelco’s customers are supported 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by its customer care specialists. TRS-RenTelco’s goal is to provide service beyond its customers’ expectations, which, the Company believes, results in customer loyalty and repeat business. Market Electronic test equipment rental is a market which we estimate has equipment on rent worldwide or available for rent with an aggregate original cost in excess of $1 billion. There is a broad customer base for the rental of such instruments, including aerospace, communications, defense, electrical contractor, electronics, industrial, installer contractor, network systems and research companies. TRS-RenTelco markets its electronic test equipment throughout the United States, Canada, and, to a limited extent, other countries. TRS-RenTelco attracts customers through its outside sales force, website at www.TRSRenTelco.com, telemarketing program, trade show participation, paid internet search and electronic mail campaigns. A key part of the sales process is TRS-RenTelco’s knowledgeable inside sales engineering team that effectively matches test equipment solutions to meet specific customer’s requirements. The Company believes that customers rent electronic test equipment for many reasons. Customers frequently need equipment for short-term projects, to evaluate new products, and for backup to avoid costly downtime. Delivery times for the purchase of such equipment can be lengthy; thus, renting allows the customer to obtain the equipment expeditiously. The Company also believes that the relative certainty of rental costs can facilitate cost control and be useful in the bidding of and pass-through of contract costs. Finally, renting rather than purchasing may better satisfy the customer’s budgetary constraints. Rentals TRS-RenTelco rents electronic test equipment typically for rental periods of one to six months, although in some instances, rental terms can be up to a year or longer. Monthly rental rates typically are between 2% and 10% of the current manufacturers’ list price. TRS-RenTelco depreciates its equipment over 1 to 8 years with no residual value. At December 31, 2019, TRS-RenTelco had an electronic test equipment rental inventory including accessories with an aggregate cost of $335.3 million. Utilization is calculated each month by dividing the cost of the rental equipment on rent by the total cost of rental equipment, excluding accessory equipment. Utilization was 64.5% as of December 31, 2019 and averaged 66.2% during the year. Sales Profit from equipment sales is a material component of TRS-RenTelco’s overall annual earnings. Gross profit from sales of both used and new equipment over the last five years generally has ranged from approximately 20% to 24% of total annual gross profit for our electronics division. For 2019, gross profit on equipment sales was approximately 20% of total division gross profit. Equipment sales are driven by the turnover of older technology rental equipment, to maintain target utilization at a model number level, and new equipment sales opportunities. In 2019, approximately 17% of the electronic test equipment revenues were derived from sales. The largest electronic test equipment sale during 2019 represented less than 4% of electronic test equipment sales, 1% of the Company’s consolidated sales and less than 1% of consolidated revenues. There is intense competition in the sales of electronic test equipment from a world-wide network of test equipment brokers and resellers, legacy rental companies, and equipment manufacturers. We believe the annual world-wide sale of electronic test equipment is in excess of $8.0 billion per year. Seasonality Rental activity may decline in the fourth quarter month of December and the first quarter months of January and February. These months may have lower rental activity due to holiday closures, particularly by larger companies, inclement weather and its impact on various field related communications equipment rentals, and companies’ operational recovery from holiday closures which may impact the start-up of new projects coming online in the first quarter. These factors may impact the quarterly results of each year’s first and fourth quarter. 9 Competition The electronic test equipment rental business is characterized by intense competition from several competitors, including Electro Rent Corporation, Continental Resources, and TestEquity, some of which may have access to greater financial and other resources than we do. TRS-RenTelco competes with these and other test equipment rental companies on the basis of product availability, price, service and reliability. Although no single competitor holds a dominant market share, we face intense competition from these established entities and new entrants in the market. Some of our competitors may offer similar equipment for lease, rental or sales at lower prices and may offer more extensive servicing, or financing options. 10 LIQUID AND SOLID CONTAINMENT TANKS AND BOXES Description Adler Tanks’ rental inventory is comprised of tanks and boxes used for various containment solutions to store hazardous and non-hazardous liquids and solids in applications such as: oil and gas exploration and field services, refinery, chemical and industrial plant maintenance, environmental remediation and field services, infrastructure building construction, marine services, pipeline construction and maintenance, tank terminals services, wastewater treatment, and waste management and landfill services. The tanks and boxes are comprised of the following products: • fixed axle steel tanks (“tanks”) for the storage of groundwater, wastewater, volatile organic liquids, sewage, slurry and bio sludge, oil and water mixtures and chemicals, which are available in a variety of sizes including 21,000 gallon, 16,000 gallon and 8,000 gallon sizes; • vacuum containers (“boxes”), which provide secure containment of sludge and solid materials and may be used for additional on-site storage or for transporting materials off-site enabling vacuum trucks to remain in operation; • dewatering boxes for the separation of water contained in sludge and slurry; and • roll-off and trash boxes for the temporary storage and transport of solid waste. Adler Tanks purchases tanks and boxes from various manufacturers located throughout the country. Competitive Strengths Market Leadership - The Company believes that Adler Tanks is one of the largest participants in the liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes rental business in North America. Adler Tanks has national reach from branches serving the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, Southeast, Southwest and West. Expertise and Customer Service – The Company believes that Adler Tanks has highly experienced operating management and branch employees. Adler Tanks employees are knowledgeable about the operation of its rental equipment and customer applications. The Company believes that Adler Tanks provides a superior level of customer service due to its strong relationship building skills and the quality of its responsiveness. Asset Management – The Company believes that Adler Tanks markets a high quality, well-constructed and well-maintained rental product. The Company depreciates its tanks and boxes over a 20 year estimated useful life to 0% residual value. We believe that if maintained, older tanks and boxes will continue to produce similar rental rates as newer equipment. The fleet’s utilization is regionally optimized by understanding key vertical market customer demand, seasonality factors, competitor’s product availability, expected equipment returns and manufacturer’s production capacity. Market Liquid and solid containment equipment rental is a market in the U.S with a large and diverse number of market segments including oil and gas exploration and field services, refinery, chemical and industrial plant maintenance, environmental remediation and field services, infrastructure building construction, marine services, pipeline construction and maintenance, electrical grid transformer maintenance, tank terminals services, wastewater treatment, and waste management and landfill services. The tank and box rental products may be utilized throughout the U.S. and are not subject to any local or regional construction code or approval standards. Rentals Adler Tanks rents tanks and boxes typically for rental periods of one to six months, although in some instances, rental terms can be up to a year or longer. Monthly rental rates typically are between 2% and 10% of the equipment’s original acquisition cost. At December 31, 2019, Adler Tanks had rental equipment inventory including accessories with an aggregate cost of $316.3 million. Utilization is calculated each month by dividing the cost of the rental equipment on rent by the total cost of rental equipment, excluding accessory equipment. Utilization was 48.4% at December 31, 2019 and averaged 54.7% during the year. 11 Seasonality Rental activity may decline in the fourth quarter month of December and the first quarter months of January and February. These months may have lower rental activity due to inclement weather in certain regions of the country impacting the industries that we serve. Competition The liquid and solid containment rental industry is highly competitive including national, regional and local companies. Some of our national competitors, notably United Rentals (acquired BakerCorp in July 2018), Rain For Rent and Mobile Mini, may be larger than we are and may have greater financial and other resources than we have. Some of our competitors also have longer operating histories, lower cost basis of rental equipment, lower cost structures and more established relationships with equipment manufacturers than we have. In addition, certain of our competitors are more geographically diverse than we are and have greater name recognition among customers than we do. As a result, our competitors that have these advantages may be better able to attract and retain customers and provide their products and services at lower rental rates. Adler Tanks competes with these companies based upon product availability, product quality, price, service and reliability. We may encounter increased competition in the markets that we serve from existing competitors or from new market entrants in the future.

RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the following discussion of various risks and uncertainties. We believe these risk factors are the most relevant to our business and could cause our results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made by us. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be seriously harmed if any of these risks or uncertainties actually occur or materialize. In that event, the market price for our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Our future operating results may fluctuate, fail to match past performance or fail to meet expectations, which may result in a decrease in our stock price. Our operating results may fluctuate in the future, may fail to match our past performance or fail to meet the expectations of analysts and investors. Our results and related ratios, such as gross margin, operating income percentage and effective tax rate may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control including but not limited to: • general economic conditions in the geographies and industries where we rent and sell our products; • legislative and educational policies where we rent and sell our products; • the budgetary constraints of our customers; • seasonality of our rental businesses and our end-markets; • success of our strategic growth initiatives; • costs associated with the launching or integration of new or acquired businesses; • the timing and type of equipment purchases, rentals and sales; • the nature and duration of the equipment needs of our customers; • the timing of new product introductions by us, our suppliers and our competitors; • the volume, timing and mix of maintenance and repair work on our rental equipment; • our equipment mix, availability, utilization and pricing; • the mix, by state and country, of our revenues, personnel and assets; • rental equipment impairment from excess, obsolete or damaged equipment; • movements in interest rates or tax rates; • changes in, and application of, accounting rules; • changes in the regulations applicable to us; and • litigation matters. As a result of these factors, our historical financial results are not necessarily indicative of our future results or stock price. Our stock price has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate in the future, which may result in a decline in the value of your investment in our common stock. The market price of our common stock fluctuates on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and is likely to be affected by a number of factors including but not limited to: • our operating performance and the performance of our competitors, and in particular any variations in our operating results or dividend rate from our stated guidance or from investors’ expectations; • any changes in general conditions in the global economy, the industries in which we operate or the global financial markets; • investors’ reaction to our press releases, public announcements or filings with the SEC; • the stock price performance of our competitors or other comparable companies; • any changes in research analysts’ coverage, recommendations or earnings estimates for us or for the stocks of other companies in our industry; 15 • any sales of common stock by our directors, executive officers and our other large shareholders, particularly in light of the limited trading volume of our stock; • any merger and acquisition activity that involves us or our competitors; and • other announcements or developments affecting us, our industry, customers, suppliers or competitors. In addition, in recent years the U.S. stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations are often unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. Additionally, the most recent global credit crisis adversely affected the prices of most publicly traded stocks as many stockholders became more willing to divest their stock holdings at lower values to increase their cash flow and reduce exposure to such fluctuations. These broad market fluctuations and any other negative economic trends may cause declines in the market price of our common stock and may be based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our Company or its performance, and these fluctuations and trends could materially reduce our stock price. Our ability to retain our executive management and to recruit, retain and motivate key qualified employees is critical to the success of our business. If we cannot successfully recruit and retain qualified personnel, our operating results and stock price may suffer. We believe that our success is directly linked to the competent people in our organization, including our executive officers, senior managers and other key personnel, and in particular, Joe Hanna, our Chief Executive Officer. Personnel turnover can be costly and could materially and adversely impact our operating results and can potentially jeopardize the success of our current strategic initiatives. We need to attract and retain highly qualified personnel to replace personnel when turnover occurs, as well as add to our staff levels as growth occurs. Our business and stock price likely will suffer if we are unable to fill, or experience delays in filling open positions, or fail to retain key personnel. Failure by third parties to manufacture and deliver our products to our specifications or on a timely basis may harm our reputation and financial condition. We depend on third parties to manufacture our products even though we are able to purchase products from a variety of third-party suppliers. In the future, we may be limited as to the number of third-party suppliers for some of our products. Although in general we make advance purchases of some products to help ensure an adequate supply, currently we do not have any long-term purchase contracts with any third-party supplier. We may experience supply problems as a result of financial or operating difficulties or failure of our suppliers, or shortages and discontinuations resulting from product obsolescence or other shortages or allocations by our suppliers. Unfavorable economic conditions may also adversely affect our suppliers or the terms on which we purchase products. In the future, we may not be able to negotiate arrangements with third parties to secure products that we require in sufficient quantities or on reasonable terms. If we cannot negotiate arrangements with third parties to produce our products or if the third parties fail to produce our products to our specifications or in a timely manner, our reputation and financial condition could be harmed. A breach of our information technology systems could subject us to liability, reputational damage or interrupt the operation of our business. We rely upon our information technology systems and infrastructure for our business. We could experience theft of confidential information or reputational damage from industrial espionage attacks, malware or other cyber-attacks, which may compromise our system infrastructure or lead to data leakage, either internally or at our third-party providers. Similarly, data privacy breaches by those who access our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to us, our employees, customers or other business partners, may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. Cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and have become increasingly difficult to detect. There can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our data and information technology systems will prevent breaches in our systems (or that of our third-party providers) that could adversely affect our business and result in financial and reputational harm to us, theft of trade secrets and other proprietary information, legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties. Disruptions in our information technology systems or failure to protect these systems against security breaches could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Additionally, if these systems fail, become unavailable for any period of time or are not upgraded, this could limit our ability to effectively monitor and control our operations and adversely affect our operations. Our information technology systems facilitate our ability to transact business, monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions. Any disruption in our information technology systems or the failure of these systems to operate as 16 expected could, depending on the magnitude of the problem, adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively transact business, monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions in a timely manner. In addition, because of recent advances in technology and well-known efforts on the part of computer hackers and cyber-terrorists to breach data security of companies, we face risks associated with potential failure to adequately protect critical corporate, customer and employee data, which, if released, could adversely impact our customer relationships, our reputation, and even violate privacy laws. As part of our business, we develop, receive and retain confidential data about our company and our customers. Further, the delay or failure to implement information system upgrades and new systems effectively could disrupt our business, distract management’s focus and attention from our business operations and growth initiatives, and increase our implementation and operating costs, any of which could negatively impact our operations and operating results. We have engaged in acquisitions and may engage in future acquisitions that could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and business. Previously, we acquired Technology Rentals & Services (“TRS”), an electronic test equipment rental business and Adler Tanks, a liquid and solid containment rental business, as well as several smaller acquisitions that were integrated into our current operating segments. We anticipate that we will continue to consider acquisitions in the future that meet our strategic growth plans. We are unable to predict whether or when any prospective acquisition will be completed. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following: • difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired companies; • diversion of management’s attention from normal daily operations of our business; • difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets may have stronger market positions; • difficulties in complying with regulations applicable to any acquired business, such as environmental regulations, and managing risks related to an acquired business; • timely completion of necessary financing and required amendments, if any, to existing agreements; • an inability to implement uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies; • undiscovered and unknown problems, defects, damaged assets liabilities, or other issues related to any acquisition that become known to us only after the acquisition; • negative reactions from our customers to an acquisition; • disruptions among employees related to any acquisition which may erode employee morale; • loss of key employees, including costly litigation resulting from the termination of those employees; • an inability to realize cost efficiencies or synergies that we may anticipate when selecting acquisition candidates; • recording of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to future impairment testing and potential periodic impairment charges; • incurring amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets; and • becoming subject to litigation. Acquisitions are inherently risky, and no assurance can be given that our future acquisitions will be successful or will not adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. The success of our acquisition strategy depends upon our ability to successfully complete acquisitions and integrate any businesses that we acquire into our existing business. The difficulties of integration could be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically dispersed organizations; maintaining acceptable standards, controls, procedures and policies; integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds; combining different corporate cultures; and the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management and other personnel. In addition, if we consummate one or more significant future acquisitions in which the consideration consists of stock or other securities, our existing shareholders’ ownership could be diluted significantly. If we were to proceed with one or more significant future acquisitions in which the consideration included cash, we could be required to use, to the extent available, a substantial portion of our Credit Facility. If we increase the amount borrowed against our available credit line, we would increase the risk of breaching the covenants under our credit facilities with our lenders. In addition, it would limit our ability to make other investments, or we may be required to seek additional debt or equity financing. Any of these items could adversely affect our results of operations. 17 If we determine that our goodwill and intangible assets have become impaired, we may incur impairment charges, which would negatively impact our operating results. At December 31, 2019, we had $35.5 million of goodwill and intangible assets, net, on our consolidated balance sheets. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, we assess potential impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets at least annually, as well as on an interim basis to the extent that factors or indicators become apparent that could reduce the fair value of any of our businesses below book value. Impairment may result from significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired asset, negative industry or economic trends and significant underperformance relative to historic or projected operating results. Our rental equipment is subject to residual value risk upon disposition, and may not sell at the prices or in the quantities we expect. The market value of any given piece of rental equipment could be less than its depreciated value at the time it is sold. The market value of used rental equipment depends on several factors, including: • the market price for new equipment of a like kind; • the age of the equipment at the time it is sold, as well as wear and tear on the equipment relative to its age; • the supply of used equipment on the market; • technological advances relating to the equipment; • worldwide and domestic demand for used equipment; and • general economic conditions. We include in income from operations the difference between the sales price and the depreciated value of an item of equipment sold. Changes in our assumptions regarding depreciation could change our depreciation expense, as well as the gain or loss realized upon disposal of equipment. Sales of our used rental equipment at prices that fall significantly below our projections or in lesser quantities than we anticipate will have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. If we do not effectively manage our credit risk, collect on our accounts receivable or recover our rental equipment from our customers’ sites, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We generally rent and sell to customers on 30 day payment terms, individually perform credit evaluation procedures on our customers for each transaction and require security deposits or other forms of security from our customers when a significant credit risk is identified. Historically, accounts receivable write-offs and write-offs related to equipment not returned by customers have not been significant and have averaged less than 1% of total revenues over the last five years. If economic conditions deteriorate, we may see an increase in bad debt relative to historical levels, which may materially and adversely affect our operations. Business segments that experience significant market disruptions or declines may experience increased customer credit risk and higher bad debt expense. Failure to manage our credit risk and receive timely payments on our customer accounts receivable may result in write-offs and/or loss of equipment, particularly electronic test equipment. If we are not able to effectively manage credit risk issues, or if a large number of our customers should have financial difficulties at the same time, our receivables and equipment losses could increase above historical levels. If this should occur, our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. Effective management of our rental assets is vital to our business. If we are not successful in these efforts, it could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Our modular, electronics and liquid and solid containment rental products have long useful lives and managing those assets is a critical element to each of our rental businesses. Generally, we design units and find manufacturers to build them to our specifications for our modular and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes. Modular asset management requires designing and building the product for a long life that anticipates the needs of our customers, including anticipating potential changes in legislation, regulations, building codes and local permitting in the various markets in which the Company operates. Electronic test equipment asset management requires understanding, selecting and investing in equipment technologies that support market demand, including anticipating technological advances and changes in manufacturers’ selling prices. Liquid and solid containment asset management requires designing and building the product for a long life, using quality components and repairing and maintaining the products to prevent leaks. For each of our modular, electronic test equipment and liquid and solid containment assets, we must successfully maintain and repair this equipment cost-effectively to maximize the useful life of the products and the level of proceeds from the sale of such products. To the extent that we are unable to do so, our result of operations could be materially adversely affected. 18 The nature of our businesses, including the ownership of industrial property, exposes us to the risk of litigation and liability under environmental, health and safety and products liability laws. Violations of environmental or health and safety related laws or associated liability could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to national, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, solid and liquid waste and hazardous substances handling, storage and disposal and employee health and safety. These laws and regulations are complex and frequently change. We could incur unexpected costs, penalties and other civil and criminal liability if we fail to comply with applicable environmental or health and safety laws. We also could incur costs or liabilities related to waste disposal or remediating soil or groundwater contamination at our properties, at our customers’ properties or at third party landfill and disposal sites. These liabilities can be imposed on the parties generating, transporting or disposing of such substances or on the owner or operator of any affected property, often without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous substances. Several aspects of our businesses involve risks of environmental and health and safety liability. For example, our operations involve the use of petroleum products, solvents and other hazardous substances in the construction and maintaining of modular buildings and for fueling and maintaining our delivery trucks and vehicles. We also own, transport and rent tanks and boxes in which waste materials are placed by our customers. The historical operations at some of our previously or currently owned or leased and newly acquired or leased properties may have resulted in undiscovered soil or groundwater contamination or historical non-compliance by third parties for which we could be held liable. Future events, such as changes in existing laws or policies or their enforcement, or the discovery of currently unknown contamination or non-compliance, may also give rise to liabilities or other claims based on these operations that may be material. In addition, compliance with future environmental or health and safety laws and regulations may require significant capital or operational expenditures or changes to our operations. Accordingly, in addition to potential penalties for non-compliance, we may become liable, either contractually or by operation of law, for investigation, remediation and monitoring costs even if the contaminated property is not presently owned or operated by us, or if the contamination was caused by third parties during or prior to our ownership or operation of the property. In addition, certain parties may be held liable for more than their “fair” share of environmental investigation and cleanup costs. Contamination and exposure to hazardous substances or other contaminants such as mold can also result in claims for remediation or damages, including personal injury, property damage, and natural resources damage claims. Although expenses related to environmental compliance, health and safety issues, and related matters have not been material to date, we cannot assure that we will not have to make significant expenditures in the future in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Violations of environmental or health and safety related laws or associated liability could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In general, litigation in the industries in which we operate, including class actions that seek substantial damages, arises with increasing frequency. Enforcement of environmental and health and safety requirements is also frequent. Such proceedings are invariably expensive, regardless of the merit of the plaintiffs’ or prosecutors’ claims. We may be named as a defendant in the future, and there can be no assurance, irrespective of the merit of such future actions, that we will not be required to make substantial settlement payments in the future. Further, a significant portion of our business is conducted in California which is one of the most highly regulated and litigious states in the country. Therefore, our potential exposure to losses and expenses due to new laws, regulations or litigation may be greater than companies with a less significant California presence. The nature of our business also subjects us to property damage and product liability claims, especially in connection with our modular buildings and tank and box rental businesses. Although we maintain liability coverage that we believe is commercially reasonable, an unusually large property damage or product liability claim or a series of claims could exceed our insurance coverage or result in damage to our reputation. Our routine business activities expose us to risk of litigation from employees, vendors and other third parties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We may be subject to claims arising from disputes with employees, vendors and other third parties in the normal course of our business; these risks may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. If the plaintiffs in any suits against us were to successfully prosecute their claims, or if we were to settle any such suits by making significant payments to the plaintiffs, our operating results and financial condition would be harmed. Even if the outcome of a claim proves favorable to us, litigation can be time consuming and costly and may divert management resources. In addition, our organizational documents require us to indemnify our senior executives to the maximum extent permitted by California law. We maintain directors’ and officers’ liability insurance that we believe is commercially reasonable in connection with such obligations, but if our senior executives were named in any lawsuit, our indemnification obligations could magnify the costs of these suits and/or exceed the coverage of such policies. 19 If we suffer loss to our facilities, equipment or distribution system due to catastrophe, our insurance policies could be inadequate or depleted, our operations could be seriously harmed, which could negatively affect our operating results. Our facilities, rental equipment and distribution systems may be subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, hurricane, earthquake, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters. In particular, our headquarters, three operating facilities, and certain of our rental equipment are located in areas of California, with above average seismic activity and could be subject to catastrophic loss caused by an earthquake. Our rental equipment and facilities in Texas, Louisiana, Florida, North Carolina and Georgia are located in areas subject to hurricanes and other tropical storms. In addition to customers’ insurance on rented equipment, we carry property insurance on our rental equipment in inventory and operating facilities as well as business interruption insurance. We believe our insurance policies have adequate limits and deductibles to mitigate the potential loss exposure of our business. We do not maintain financial reserves for policy deductibles and our insurance policies contain exclusions that are customary for our industry, including exclusions for earthquakes, flood and terrorism. If any of our facilities or a significant amount of our rental equipment were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay orders, shipments and revenue recognition and result in expenses to repair or replace the damaged rental equipment and facility not covered by insurance, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our debt instruments contain covenants that restrict or prohibit our ability to enter into a variety of transactions and may limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs. If we have an event of default under these instruments, our indebtedness could be accelerated and we may not be able to refinance such indebtedness or make the required accelerated payments. The agreements governing our Series B and Series C Senior Notes (as defined and more fully described under the heading “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources”) and our Credit Facility contain various covenants that limit our discretion in operating our business. In particular, we are limited in our ability to merge, consolidate, reorganize or transfer substantially all of our assets, make investments, pay dividends or distributions, redeem or repurchase stock, change the nature of our business, enter into transactions with affiliates, incur indebtedness and create liens on our assets to secure debt. In addition, we are required to meet certain financial covenants under these instruments. These restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financing, make strategic acquisitions or needed capital expenditures, withstand economic downturns in our business or the economy in general, conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise. A failure to comply with the restrictions contained in these agreements could lead to an event of default, which could result in an acceleration of our indebtedness. In the event of an acceleration, we may not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to refinance our indebtedness or make any required accelerated payments. If we default on our indebtedness, our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The majority of our indebtedness is subject to variable interest rates, which makes us vulnerable to increases in interest rates, which could negatively affect our net income. Our indebtedness exposes us to interest rate increases because the majority of our indebtedness is subject to variable rates. At present, we do not have any derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps or hedges to mitigate interest rate variability. The interest rates under our credit facilities are reset at varying periods. These interest rate adjustments could cause periodic fluctuations in our operating results and cash flows. Our annual debt service obligations increase by approximately $1.9 million per year for each 1% increase in the average interest rate we pay based on the $193.4 million balance of variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2019. If interest rates rise in the future, and, particularly if they rise significantly, interest expense will increase and our net income will be negatively affected. Our effective tax rate may change and become less predictable as our business expands, making our future earnings less predictable. We continue to consider expansion opportunities domestically and internationally for our rental businesses. Since the Company’s effective tax rate depends on business levels, personnel and assets located in various jurisdictions, further expansion into new markets or acquisitions may change the effective tax rate in the future and may make it, and consequently our earnings, less predictable going forward. In addition, the enactment of future tax law changes by federal and state taxing authorities may impact the Company’s current period tax provision and its deferred tax liabilities. 20 Changes in financial accounting standards may cause lower than expected operating results and affect our reported results of operations. Changes in accounting standards and their application may have a significant effect on our reported results on a going-forward basis and may also affect the recording and disclosure of previously reported transactions. New accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred in the past and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business. Failure to comply with internal control attestation requirements could lead to loss of public confidence in our financial statements and negatively impact our stock price. As a public reporting company, we are required to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, including Section 404, and the related rules and regulations of the SEC, including expanded disclosures and accelerated reporting requirements. Compliance with Section 404 and other related requirements has increased our costs and will continue to require additional management resources. We may need to continue to implement additional finance and accounting systems, procedures and controls to satisfy new reporting requirements. While our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 was effective, there is no assurance that future assessments of the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting will be favorable. If we are unable to obtain future unqualified reports as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our internal control over financial reporting, which could adversely affect our stock price. SPECIFIC RISKS RELATED TO OUR RELOCATABLE MODULAR BUILDINGS BUSINESS SEGMENT: Significant reductions of, or delays in, funding to public schools have caused the demand and pricing for our modular classroom units to decline, which has in the past caused, and may cause in the future, a reduction in our revenues and profitability. Rentals and sales of modular buildings to public school districts for use as classrooms, restroom buildings, and administrative offices for K-12 represent a significant portion of Mobile Modular’s rental and sales revenues. Funding for public school facilities is derived from a variety of sources including the passage of both statewide and local facility bond measures, developer fees and various taxes levied to support school operating budgets. Many of these funding sources are subject to financial and political considerations, which vary from district to district and are not tied to demand. Historically, we have benefited from the passage of statewide and local facility bond measures and believe these are essential to our business. The state of California is our largest market for classroom rentals. The strength of this market depends heavily on public funding from voter passage of both state and local facility bond measures, and the ability of the state to sell such bonds in the public market. A lack of passage of state and local facility bond measures, or the inability to sell bonds in the public markets in the future could reduce our revenues and operating income, and consequently have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition. Furthermore, even if voters have approved facility bond measures and the state has raised bond funds, there is no guarantee that individual school projects will be funded in a timely manner. As a consequence of the most recent economic recession, many states and local governments experienced large budget deficits resulting in severe budgetary constraints among public school districts. To the extent public school districts’ funding is reduced for the rental and purchase of modular buildings, our business could be harmed and our results of operations negatively impacted. We believe that interruptions or delays in the passage of facility bond measures or completion of state budgets, an insufficient amount of state funding, a significant reduction of funding to public schools, or changes negatively impacting enrollment may reduce the rental and sale demand for our educational products. Any reductions in funding available to the school districts from the states in which we do business may cause school districts to experience budget shortfalls and to reduce their demand for our products despite growing student populations, class size reduction initiatives and modernization and reconstruction project needs, which could reduce our revenues and operating income and consequently have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition. Public policies that create demand for our products and services may change, resulting in decreased demand for or the pricing of our products and services, which could negatively affect our revenues and operating income. Various states that we operate enacted laws and constitutional amendments to provide funding for school districts to limit the number of students that may be grouped in a single classroom. School districts with class sizes in excess of state limits have been and continue to be a significant source of our demand for modular classrooms. In California, efforts to address aging infrastructure and deferred maintenance have resulted in modernization and reconstruction projects by public school districts including seismic retrofitting, asbestos abatement and various building repairs and upgrades, which has been another source of demand for our modular classrooms. The most recent economic recession caused state and local budget shortfalls, which reduced school districts’ funding and their ability to comply with state class size reduction requirements. If educational priorities and policies shift away from class-size 21 reduction or modernization and reconstruction projects, demand and pricing for our products and services may decline, not grow as quickly as, or not reach the levels that we anticipate. Significant equipment returns may result in lower utilization until equipment can be redeployed or sold, which may cause rental rates to decline and negatively affect our revenues and operating income. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could harm our business and financial condition, resulting in lower operating results and cash flows. Similar to conventionally constructed buildings, the modular building industry, including the manufacturers and lessors of portable classrooms, are subject to regulations by multiple governmental agencies at the federal, state and local level relating to environmental, zoning, health, safety, energy efficiency, labor and transportation matters, among other matters. Failure to comply with these laws or regulations could impact our business or harm our reputation and result in higher capital or operating expenditures or the imposition of penalties or restrictions on our operations. As with conventional construction, typically new codes and regulations are not retroactively applied. Nonetheless, new governmental regulations in these or other areas may increase our acquisition cost of new rental equipment, limit the use of or make obsolete some of our existing equipment, or increase our costs of rental operations. Building codes are generally reviewed every three years. All aspects of a given code are subject to change including, but not limited to, such items as structural specifications for earthquake safety, energy efficiency and environmental standards, fire and life safety, transportation, lighting and noise limits. On occasion, state agencies have undertaken studies of indoor air quality and noise levels with a focus on permanent and modular classrooms. These results could impact our existing modular equipment and affect the future construction of our modular product. Compliance with building codes and regulations entails a certain amount of risk as state and local government authorities do not necessarily interpret building codes and regulations in a consistent manner, particularly where applicable regulations may be unclear and subject to interpretation. These regulations often provide broad discretion to governmental authorities that oversee these matters, which can result in unanticipated delays or increases in the cost of compliance in particular markets. The construction and modular industries have developed many “best practices” which are constantly evolving. Some of our peers and competitors may adopt practices that are more or less stringent than the Company’s. When, and if, regulatory standards are clarified, the effect of the clarification may be to impose rules on our business and practices retroactively, at which time, we may not be in compliance with such regulations and we may be required to incur costly remediation. If we are unable to pass these increased costs on to our customers, our profitability, operating cash flows and financial condition could be negatively impacted. Expansions of our modular operations into new markets may negatively affect our operating results. In the past we have expanded our modular operations into new geographies and states. There are risks inherent in the undertaking of such expansion, including the risk of revenue from the business in any new markets not meeting our expectations, higher than expected costs in entering these new markets, risk associated with compliance with applicable state and local laws and regulations, response by competitors and unanticipated consequences of expansion. In addition, expansion into new markets may be affected by local economic and market conditions. Expansion of our operations into new markets will require a significant amount of attention from our management, a commitment of financial resources and will require us to add qualified management in these markets, which may negatively impact our operating results. We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts. These laws and regulations make these government contracts more favorable to government entities than other third parties and any changes in these laws and regulations, or our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business. We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. For example, many government contracts contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts such as clauses that allow government entities not to perform on contractual obligations in the case of a lack of fiscal funding. Also, in the educational markets we serve, we are able to utilize “piggyback” contracts in marketing our products and services and ultimately to book business. The term “piggyback” contract refers to contracts for portable classrooms or other products entered into by public school districts following a formal bid process that allows for the use of the same contract terms and conditions with the successful vendor by other public school districts. As a result, “piggyback” contracts allow us to more readily book orders from our government customers, primarily public school districts, and to reduce the administrative expense associated with booking these orders. The governmental statutes and regulations that allow for use of “piggyback” contracts are subject to change or elimination in their entirety. A change in the manner of use or the elimination of “piggyback” contracts would likely negatively impact our ability to book new business from these government customers and could cause our administrative expenses related to processing these orders to increase significantly. In addition, any failure to comply with these laws and regulations might result in 22 administrative penalties or even in the suspension of these contracts and as a result, the loss of the related revenues which would harm our business and results from operations. Seasonality of our educational business may have adverse consequences for our business. A significant portion of the modular sale and rental revenues is derived from the educational market. Typically, during each calendar year, our highest numbers of classrooms are shipped for rental and sale orders during the second and third quarters for delivery and installation prior to the start of the upcoming school year. The majority of classrooms shipped in the second and third quarters have rental start dates during the third quarter, thereby making the fourth quarter the first full quarter of rental revenues recognized for these transactions. Although this is the historical seasonality of our business, it is subject to change or may not meet our expectations, which may have adverse consequences for our business. We face strong competition in our modular building markets and we may not be able to effectively compete. The modular building leasing industry is highly competitive in our states of operation and we expect it to remain so. The competitive market in which we operate may prevent us from raising rental fees or sales prices to pass any increased costs on to our customers. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including equipment availability, quality, price, service, reliability, appearance, functionality and delivery terms. We may experience pricing pressures in our areas of operation in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing prices. Some of our competitors in the modular building leasing industry, notably WillScot Corporation, have a greater range of products and services, greater financial and marketing resources, larger customer bases, and greater name recognition than we have. In August 2018, WillScot Corporation completed the acquisition of Modspace. These combined competitors may be better able to respond to changes in the relocatable modular building market, to finance acquisitions, to fund internal growth and to compete for market share, any of which could harm our business. We may not be able to quickly redeploy modular units returning from leases, which could negatively affect our financial performance and our ability to expand, or utilize, our rental fleet. As of December 31, 2019, 63% of our modular portfolio had equipment on rent for periods exceeding the original committed term. Generally, when a customer continues to rent the modular units beyond the contractual term, the equipment rents on a month-to-month basis. If a significant number of our rented modular units were returned during a short period of time, particularly those units that are rented on a month-to-month basis, a large supply of units would need to be remarketed. Our failure to effectively remarket a large influx of units returning from leases could negatively affect our financial performance and our ability to continue expanding our rental fleet. In addition, if returned units stay off rent for an extended period of time, we may incur additional costs to securely store and maintain them. Significant increases in raw material and labor costs could increase our acquisition cost of new modular rental units and repair and maintenance costs of our fleet, which would increase our operating costs and harm our profitability. We incur labor costs and purchase raw materials, including lumber, siding and roofing and other products to perform periodic repairs, modifications and refurbishments to maintain physical conditions of our modular units. The volume, timing and mix of maintenance and repair work on our rental equipment may vary quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. Generally, increases in labor and raw material costs will also increase the acquisition cost of new modular units and increase the repair and maintenance costs of our fleet. We also maintain a fleet of service trucks and use subcontractor companies for the delivery, set-up, return delivery and dismantle of modulars for our customers. We rely on our subcontractor service companies to meet customer demands for timely shipment and return, and the loss or inadequate number of subcontractor service companies may cause prices to increase, while negatively impacting our reputation and operating performance. During periods of rising prices for labor, raw materials or fuel, and in particular, when the prices increase rapidly or to levels significantly higher than normal, we may incur significant increases in our acquisition costs for new modular units and incur higher operating costs that we may not be able to recoup from our customers, which would reduce our profitability. Failure by third parties to manufacture our products timely or properly may harm our reputation and financial condition. We are dependent on third parties to manufacture our products even though we are able to purchase products from a variety of third-party suppliers. Mobile Modular purchases new modulars from various manufacturers who build to Mobile Modular’s design specifications. With the exception of Enviroplex, none of the principal suppliers are affiliated with the Company. During 2019, Mobile Modular purchased 27% of its modular product from one manufacturer. The Company believes that the loss of any of its primary manufacturers of modulars could have an adverse effect on its operations since Mobile Modular could experience higher prices and longer delivery lead times for modular product until other manufacturers were able to increase their production capacity. 23 Failure to properly design, manufacture, repair and maintain the modular product may result in impairment charges, potential litigation and reduction of our operating results and cash flows. We estimate the useful life of the modular product to be 18 years with a residual value of 50%. However, proper design, manufacture, repairs and maintenance of the modular product during our ownership is required for the product to reach the estimated useful life of 18 years with a residual value of 50%. If we do not appropriately manage the design, manufacture, repair and maintenance of our modular product, or otherwise delay or defer such repair or maintenance, we may be required to incur impairment charges for equipment that is beyond economic repair costs or incur significant capital expenditures to acquire new modular product to serve demand. In addition, such failures may result in personal injury or property damage claims, including claims based on presence of mold, and termination of leases or contracts by customers. Costs of contract performance, potential litigation, and profits lost from termination could accordingly reduce our future operating results and cash flows. Our warranty costs may increase and warranty claims could damage our reputation and negatively impact our revenues and operating income. Sales of new relocatable modular buildings not manufactured by us are typically covered by warranties provided by the manufacturer of the products sold. We provide ninety-day warranties on certain modular sales of used rental units and one-year warranties on equipment manufactured by our Enviroplex subsidiary. Historically, our warranty costs have not been significant, and we monitor the quality of our products closely. If a defect were to arise in the installation of our equipment at the customer’s facilities or in the equipment acquired from our suppliers or by our Enviroplex subsidiary, we may experience increased warranty claims. Such claims could disrupt our sales operations, damage our reputation and require costly repairs or other remedies, negatively impacting revenues and operating income. SPECIFIC RISKS RELATED TO OUR ELECTRONIC TEST EQUIPMENT BUSINESS SEGMENT: Market risk and cyclical downturns in the industries using test equipment may result in periods of low demand for our product resulting in excess inventory, impairment charges and reduction of our operating results and cash flows. TRS-RenTelco’s revenues are derived from the rental and sale of general purpose and communications test equipment to a broad range of companies, from Fortune 500 to middle and smaller market companies, in the aerospace, defense, communications, manufacturing and semiconductor industries. Electronic test equipment rental and sales revenues are primarily affected by the business activity within these industries related to research and development, manufacturing, and communication infrastructure installation and maintenance. Historically, these industries have been cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns, which can have a material adverse impact on the industry’s demand for equipment, including our rental electronic test equipment. In addition, the severity and length of any downturn in an industry may also affect overall access to capital, which could adversely affect our customers and result in excess inventory and impairment charges. During periods of reduced and declining demand for test equipment, we are exposed to additional receivable risk from non-payment and may need to rapidly align our cost structure with prevailing market conditions, which may negatively impact our operating results and cash flows. Seasonality of our electronic test equipment business may impact quarterly results. Generally, rental activity declines in the fourth quarter month of December and the first quarter months of January and February. These months may have lower rental activity due to holiday closures, particularly by larger companies, inclement weather and its impact on various field related communications equipment rentals, and companies’ operational recovery from holiday closures which may impact the start-up of new projects coming online in the first quarter. These seasonal factors historically have impacted quarterly results in each year’s first and fourth quarter, but we are unable to predict how such factors may impact future periods. Our rental test equipment may become obsolete or may no longer be supported by a manufacturer, which could result in an impairment charge. Electronic test equipment is characterized by changing technology and evolving industry standards that may render our existing equipment obsolete through new product introductions, or enhancements, before the end of its anticipated useful life, causing us to incur impairment charges. We must anticipate and keep pace with the introduction of new hardware, software and networking technologies and acquire equipment that will be marketable to our current and prospective customers. Additionally, some manufacturers of our equipment may be acquired or cease to exist, resulting in a future lack of support for equipment purchased from those manufacturers. This could result in the remaining useful life becoming shorter, causing us to incur an impairment charge. We monitor our manufacturers’ capacity to support their products and the introduction of new technologies, and we acquire equipment that will be marketable to our current and prospective customers. However, any prolonged economic downturn could result in unexpected bankruptcies or reduced support from our manufacturers. Failure to properly select, manage and respond to the technological needs of our customers and changes to our products through their technology life cycle may cause certain 24 electronic test equipment to become obsolete, resulting in impairment charges, which may negatively impact operating results and cash flows. If we do not effectively compete in the rental equipment market, our operating results will be materially and adversely affected. The electronic test equipment rental business is characterized by intense competition from several competitors, including Electro Rent Corporation, Continental Resources and TestEquity, some of which may have access to greater financial and other resources than we do. Although no single competitor holds a dominant market share, we face competition from these established entities and new entrants in the market. We believe that we anticipate and keep pace with the introduction of new products and acquire equipment that will be marketable to our current and prospective customers. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including product availability, price, service and reliability. Some of our competitors may offer similar equipment for lease, rental or sale at lower prices and may offer more extensive servicing, or financing options. Failure to adequately forecast the adoption of, and demand for, new or existing products may cause us not to meet our customers’ equipment requirements and may materially and adversely affect our operating results. If we are not able to obtain equipment at favorable rates, there could be a material adverse effect on our operating results and reputation. The majority of our rental equipment portfolio is comprised of general purpose test and measurement instruments purchased from leading manufacturers such as Keysight Technologies, Rhode & Schwarz and Tektronix, a division of Fortive Corporation. We depend on purchasing equipment from these manufacturers and suppliers for use as our rental equipment. If, in the future, we are not able to purchase necessary equipment from one or more of these suppliers on favorable terms, we may not be able to meet our customers’ demands in a timely manner or for a rental rate that generates a profit. If this should occur, we may not be able to secure necessary equipment from an alternative source on acceptable terms and our business and reputation may be materially and adversely affected. If we are not able to anticipate and mitigate the risks associated with operating internationally, there could be a material adverse effect on our operating results. Currently, total foreign country customers and operations account for less than 10% of the Company’s revenues. In recent years some of our customers have expanded their international operations faster than domestic operations, and this trend may continue. Over time, the amount of our international business may increase if we focus on international market opportunities. Operating in foreign countries subjects the Company to additional risks, any of which may adversely impact our future operating results, including: • international political, economic and legal conditions including tariffs and trade barriers; • our ability to comply with customs, anti-corruption, import/export and other trade compliance regulations, together with any unexpected changes in such regulations; • greater difficulty in our ability to recover rental equipment and obtain payment of the related trade receivables; • additional costs to establish and maintain international subsidiaries and related operations; • difficulties in attracting and retaining staff and business partners to operate internationally; • language and cultural barriers; • seasonal reductions in business activities in the countries where our international customers are located; • difficulty with the integration of foreign operations; • longer payment cycles; • currency fluctuations; and • potential adverse tax consequences. Unfavorable currency exchange rates may negatively impact our financial results in U.S. dollar terms. We receive revenues in Canadian dollars from our business activities in Canada. Conducting business in currencies other than U.S. dollars subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. If the currency exchange rates change unfavorably, the value of net receivables we receive in foreign currencies and later convert to U.S. dollars after the unfavorable change would be diminished. This could have a negative impact on our reported operating results. We currently do not engage in hedging strategies to mitigate this risk. 25 The impact of the coronavirus on our operations, and the operations of our customers, suppliers and logistics providers, may harm our business. We are monitoring the potential impact of the coronavirus outbreak in China. This includes evaluating the impact on our customers, suppliers, and logistics providers as well as evaluating governmental actions being taken to curtail the spread of the virus. The significance of the impact on us is yet uncertain; however, a material adverse effect on our customers, suppliers, or logistics providers could impact our operating results. SPECIFIC RISKS RELATED TO OUR LIQUID AND SOLID CONTAINMENT TANKS AND BOXES BUSINESS SEGMENT: We may be brought into tort or environmental litigation or held responsible for cleanup of spills if the customer fails to perform, or an accident occurs in the use of our rental products, which could materially adversely affect our business, future operating results or financial position. Our rental tanks and boxes are used by our customers to store non-hazardous and certain hazardous liquids and solids on the customer’s site. Our customers are generally responsible for proper operation of our tank and box rental equipment while on rent and returning a cleaned and undamaged container upon completion of use, but exceptions may be granted and we cannot always assure that these responsibilities are fully met in all cases. Although we require the customer to carry commercial general liability insurance in a minimum amount of $5,000,000, such policies often contain pollution exclusions and other exceptions. Furthermore, we cannot be certain our liability insurance will always be sufficient. In addition, if an accident were to occur involving our rental equipment or a spill of substances were to occur when the tank or box was in transport or on rent with our customer, a claim could be made against us as owner of the rental equipment. In the event of a spill or accident, we may be brought into a lawsuit or enforcement action by either our customer or a third party on numerous potential grounds, including an allegation that an inherent flaw in a tank or box contributed to an accident or that the tank had suffered some undiscovered harm from a previous customer’s prior use. In the event of a spill caused by our customers, we may be held responsible for cleanup under environmental laws and regulations concerning obligations of suppliers of rental products to effect remediation. In addition, applicable environmental laws and regulations may impose liability on us for the conduct of third parties, or for actions that complied with applicable regulations when taken, regardless of negligence or fault. Substantial damage awards have also been made in certain jurisdictions against lessors of industrial equipment based upon claims of personal injury, property damage, and resource damage caused by the use of various products. While we take what we believe are reasonable precautions that our rental equipment is in good and safe condition prior to rental and carry insurance to protect against certain risks of loss or accidents, such liability could adversely impact our profitability. The liquid and solid containment rental industry is highly competitive, and competitive pressures could lead to a decrease in our market share or in rental rates and our ability to rent, or sell, equipment at favorable prices, which could adversely affect our operating results. The liquid and solid containment rental industry is highly competitive. We compete against national, regional and local companies, including United Rentals, Rain For Rent and Mobile Mini, all of which may be larger than we are, may offer a wider range of products and services and may have greater financial and marketing resources than we have. Some of our competitors also have longer operating histories, lower cost basis of rental equipment, lower cost structures and more established relationships with equipment manufacturers than we have. In addition, certain of our competitors are more geographically diverse than we are and have greater name recognition among customers than we do. As a result, our competitors that have these advantages may be better able to attract customers and provide their products and services at lower rental rates. Some competitors offer different approaches to liquid storage, such as large-volume modular tanks that may have better economics and compete with conventional frac tanks in certain oil and gas field applications. We may in the future encounter increased competition in the markets that we serve from existing competitors or from new market entrants. In July 2018, United Rentals, Inc. completed the acquisition of BakerCorp. This acquisition may create additional competition for customers and provide the combined entity access to greater financial resources than we have. We believe that equipment quality, service levels, rental rates and fleet size are key competitive factors in the liquid and solid containment rental industry. From time to time, we or our competitors may attempt to compete aggressively by lowering rental rates or prices. Competitive pressures could adversely affect our revenues and operating results by decreasing our market share or depressing rental rates. To the extent we lower rental rates or increase our fleet in order to retain or increase market share, our operating margins would be adversely impacted. In addition, we may not be able to match a larger competitor’s price reductions or fleet investment because of its greater financial resources, all of which could adversely impact our operating results through a combination of a decrease in our market share, revenues and operating income. 26 Market risk, commodity price volatility, regulatory changes or interruptions and cyclical downturns in the industries using tanks and boxes may result in periods of low demand for our products resulting in excess inventory, impairment charges and reduction of our operating results and cash flows. Adler Tanks’ revenues are derived from the rental of tanks and boxes to companies involved in oil and gas exploration, extraction and refinement, environmental remediation and wastewater/groundwater treatment, infrastructure and building construction and various industrial services, among others. We expect tank and box rental revenues will primarily be affected by the business activity within these industries. Historically, these industries have been cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns, which have a material adverse impact on the industry’s demand for equipment, including the tanks and boxes rented by us. Lower oil or gas prices may have an adverse effect on our liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes business. Any steep decline in both domestic and international oil and gas prices driven by materially higher supply levels and weak demand could have a significant negative impact on the industry’s demand for equipment, especially if such market conditions continue for an extended period of time. If the price reduction causes customers to limit or stop exploration, extraction or refinement activities, resulting in lower demand and pricing for renting Adler Tank’s products, our financial results could be adversely impacted. Also, a weak U.S. economy may negatively impact infrastructure construction and industrial activity. Any of these factors may result in excess inventory or impairment charges and reduce our operating results and cash flows. Changes in regulatory, or governmental, oversight of hydraulic fracturing could materially adversely affect the demand for our rental products and reduce our operating results and cash flows. We believe that demand related to hydraulic fracturing has increased the total rental revenues and market size in recent years. Oil and gas exploration and extraction (including use of tanks for hydraulic fracturing to obtain shale oil and shale gas) are subject to numerous local, state and federal regulations. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, oil and gas exploration and production accounted for approximately 10% of Adler Tanks’ rental revenues, and approximately 2% of the Company’s total revenues. The hydraulic fracturing method of extraction has come under scrutiny in several states and by the Federal government due to the potential adverse effects that hydraulic fracturing, and the liquids and chemicals used, may have on water quality and public health. In addition, the disposal of wastewater from the hydraulic fracturing process into injection wells may increase the rate of seismic activity near drill sites and could result in regulatory changes, delays or interruption of future activity. Changes in these regulations could limit, interrupt, or stop exploration and extraction activities, which would negatively impact the demand for our rental products. Finally, it is possible that changes in the technology utilized in hydraulic fracturing could make it less dependent on liquids and therefore lower the related requirements for the use of our rental products, which would reduce our operating results and cash flows. Seasonality of the liquid and solid containment rental industry may impact quarterly results. Rental activity may decline in the fourth quarter month of December and the first quarter months of January and February. These months may have lower rental activity in parts of the country where inclement weather may delay, or suspend, a company’s project. The impact of these delays may be to decrease the number of tanks, or boxes, on rent until companies are able to resume their projects when weather improves. These seasonal factors historically have impacted quarterly results in each year’s first and fourth quarter, but we are unable to predict how such factors may impact future periods. Significant increases in raw material, fuel and labor costs could increase our acquisition and operating costs of rental equipment, which would increase operating costs and decrease profitability. Increases in raw material costs such as steel and labor to manufacture liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes would increase the cost of acquiring new equipment. These price increases could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations if we are not able to recoup these increases through higher rental revenues. In addition, a significant amount of revenues are generated from the transport of rental equipment to and from customers. We own delivery trucks, employ drivers and utilize subcontractors to provide these services. The price of fuel can be unpredictable and beyond our control. During periods of rising fuel and labor costs, and in particular when prices increase rapidly, we may not be able recoup these costs from our customers, which would reduce our profitability. Failure by third parties to manufacture our products timely or properly may harm our ability to meet customer demand and harm our financial condition. We are dependent on a variety of third party companies to manufacture equipment to be used in our rental fleet. In some cases, we may not be able to procure equipment on a timely basis to the extent that manufacturers for the quantities of equipment we need are not able to produce sufficient inventory on schedules that meet our delivery requirements. If demand for new equipment increases significantly, especially during a seasonal manufacturing slowdown, manufacturers may not be able to meet customer orders on a timely basis. As a result, we at times may experience long lead-times for certain types of new equipment and we cannot assure that 27 we will be able to acquire the types or sufficient numbers of the equipment we need to grow our rental fleet as quickly as we would like and this could harm our ability to meet customer demand and harm our financial condition. We derive a meaningful amount of our revenue in our liquid and solid containment tank and boxes business from a limited number of customers, the loss of one or more of which could have an adverse effect on our business. Periodically, a meaningful portion of our revenue in our liquid and solid containment tank and boxes business may be generated from a few major customers. Although we have some long-term relationships with our major customers, we cannot be assured that our customers will continue to use our products or services or that they will continue to do so at historical levels. The loss of any meaningful customer, the failure to collect a material receivable from a meaningful customer, any material reduction in orders by a meaningful customer or the cancellation of a meaningful customer order could significantly reduce our revenues and consequently harm our financial condition and our ability to fund our operations. We may not be able to quickly redeploy equipment returning from leases at equivalent prices. Many of our rental transactions are short-term in nature with pricing established on a daily basis. The length of time that a customer needs equipment can often be difficult to determine and can be impacted by a number of factors such as weather, customer funding and project delays. In addition, our equipment is primarily used in the oil and gas, industrial plant services, environmental remediation and infrastructure and building construction industries. Changes in the economic conditions facing any of those industries could result in a significant number of units returning off rent, both for us and our competitors. If the supply of rental equipment available on the market significantly increases due to units coming off rent, demand for and pricing of our rental products could be adversely impacted. We may experience delays in remarketing our off-rent units to new customers and incur cost to move the units to other regions where demand is stronger. Actions in these circumstances by our competitors may also depress the market price for rental units. These delays and price pressures would adversely affect equipment utilization levels and total revenues, which would reduce our profitability. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES. The Company’s corporate and administrative offices are located in Livermore, California in approximately 26,000 square feet. The Company’s four reportable business segments currently conduct operations from the following locations: Mobile Modular – Five inventory centers, at which relocatable modular buildings and storage containers are displayed, refurbished and stored are located in Livermore, California (137 acres in the San Francisco Bay Area), Mira Loma, California (79 acres in the Los Angeles area), Pasadena, Texas (50 acres in the Houston area), in Grand Prairie, Texas (43 acres in Dallas area), Auburndale, Florida (123 acres in the Orlando area) and Arcade, Georgia (48 acres in the Atlanta area). The inventory centers conduct rental and sales operations from modular buildings, serving as working models of the Company’s modular product. The Company also has a leased modular sales office in Charlotte, North Carolina from which the states of North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia and Maryland are served. TRS-RenTelco – Electronic test equipment rental and sales operations are conducted from a 117,000 square foot leased facility in Grapevine, Texas (Dallas area) and a sales office in Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Quebec (Montreal, Canada area). Adler Tanks – Adler Tanks operates from branch offices serving the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, Southeast, Southwest and West. A number of our branch offices are leased and have remaining lease terms of one to three years, or are leased on a month to month basis. We believe satisfactory alternative properties can be found in all of our markets if we do not renew our existing leased properties. Enviroplex – The Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Enviroplex, manufactures modular buildings used primarily as classrooms in California from its 108,000 square foot facility in Stockton, California (San Francisco Bay Area). ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. The Company is involved in various lawsuits and routine claims arising out of the normal course of its business. The Company maintains insurance coverage for its operations and employees with appropriate aggregate, per occurrence and deductible limits as the 28 Company reasonably determines necessary or prudent with current operations and historical experience. The major policies include coverage for property, general liability, auto, directors and officers, health, and workers’ compensation insurances. In the opinion of management, the ultimate amount of liability not covered by insurance, if any, under any pending litigation and claims, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position or operating results of the Company.

The Company presents Adjusted EBITDA as a financial measure as management believes it provides useful information to investors regarding the Company’s liquidity and financial condition and because management, as well as the Company’s lenders, use this measure in evaluating the performance of the Company. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a supplement to GAAP measures to further evaluate period-to-period operating performance, compliance with financial covenants in the Company’s revolving lines of credit and senior notes and the Company’s ability to meet future capital expenditure and working capital requirements. Management believes the exclusion of non-cash charges, including share-based compensation, is useful in measuring the Company’s cash available for operations and performance of the Company. Because management finds Adjusted EBITDA useful, the Company believes its investors will also find Adjusted EBITDA useful in evaluating the Company’s performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, cash flows, or other consolidated income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of the Company’s profitability or liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA is not in accordance with or an alternative for GAAP, and may be different from non−GAAP measures used by other companies. Unlike EBITDA, which may be used by other companies or investors, Adjusted EBITDA does not include share-based compensation charges. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is of limited use in that it does not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and does not accurately reflect real cash flow. In addition, other companies may not use Adjusted EBITDA or may use other non-GAAP measures, limiting the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA for purposes of comparison. The Company’s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that the Company will not incur expenses that are the same as or similar to the adjustments in this presentation. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA should only be used to evaluate the Company’s results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. The Company compensates for the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA by relying upon GAAP results to gain a complete picture of the Company’s performance. Because Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure, as defined by the SEC, the Company includes in the tables below reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.

Adjusted EBITDA is a component of two restrictive financial covenants for the Company’s unsecured Credit Facility, Series B Senior Notes and Series C Senior Notes (as defined and more fully described under the heading “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources”). These instruments contain financial covenants requiring the Company to not: • Permit the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility and the Note Purchase Agreement (as defined and more fully described under the heading “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Liquidity and Capital Resources” in this MD&A)) of Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility and the Note Purchase Agreement) to fixed charges as of the end of any fiscal quarter to be less than 2.50 to 1. At December 31, 2019, the actual ratio was 4.27 to 1. • Permit the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of funded debt (as defined in the Credit Facility and the Note Purchase Agreement) to Adjusted EBITDA at any time during any period of four consecutive quarters to be greater than 2.75 to 1. At December 31, 2019, the actual ratio was 1.24 to 1. At December 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with each of these aforementioned covenants. There are no anticipated trends that the Company is aware of that would indicate non-compliance with these covenants, though, significant deterioration in our financial performance could impact the Company's ability to comply with these covenants. 32 ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company’s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth in this section as well as those discussed under Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this document. This discussion should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes thereto set forth in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Results of Operations General The Company, incorporated in 1979, is a leading rental provider of relocatable modular buildings for classroom and office space, electronic test equipment for general purpose and communications needs, and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes. The Company’s primary emphasis is on equipment rentals. The Company is comprised of four reportable business segments: (1) its modular building and portable storage container rental segment (“Mobile Modular”); (2) its electronic test equipment rental segment (“TRS-RenTelco”); (3) its containment solutions for the storage of hazardous and non-hazardous liquids and solids segment (“Adler Tanks”); and (4) its classroom manufacturing segment selling modular buildings used primarily as classrooms in California (“Enviroplex”). In 2019, Mobile Modular, TRS-RenTelco, Adler Tanks and Enviroplex contributed 54%, 27%, 11% and 8%, respectively, of the Company’s income before provision for taxes (the equivalent of “pre-tax income”), compared to 53%, 28%, 14% and 5%, respectively, for 2018. The Company generates its revenues primarily from the rental of its equipment on operating leases with sales of equipment occurring in the normal course of business. The Company requires significant capital outlay to purchase its rental inventory and recovers its investment through rental and sales revenues. Rental revenue and certain other service revenues negotiated as part of the lease agreements with customers and related costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the lease. Sales revenue and related costs are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment to the customers. Sales revenues are less predictable and can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer demands and requirements. Generally, rental revenues less cash operating costs recover the equipment’s capitalized cost in a shorter period of time relative to the equipment’s potential rental life and when sold, sale proceeds are usually above its net book value. The Company’s rental operations include rental and rental related services revenues which comprised approximately 80% of the Company’s total revenues in 2019 and for the three years ended December 31, 2019. Over the past three years, modulars, electronic test equipment and tanks and boxes comprised approximately 54%, 23% and 23%, respectively, of the cumulative rental operations revenues. The Company’s direct costs of rental operations include depreciation of rental equipment, rental related service costs, impairment of rental equipment, and other direct costs of rental operations (which include direct labor, supplies, repairs, insurance, property taxes, license fees and amortization of certain lease costs). The Company sells modular, electronic test equipment and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes that are new, or previously rented. The Company’s Enviroplex subsidiary manufactures and sells modular classrooms. The renting and selling of some modular equipment requires a dealer’s license, which the Company has obtained from the appropriate governmental agencies. Sales and other revenues of modulars, electronic test equipment and tanks and boxes have comprised approximately 20% of the Company’s consolidated revenues in 2019 and for the three years ended December 31, 2019. Over the past three years, modulars, electronic test equipment and tanks and boxes comprised approximately 74%, 24% and 2% of sales and other revenues, respectively. The Company’s cost of sales includes the carrying value of the equipment sold and the direct costs associated with the equipment sold such as delivery, installation, modifications and related site work. The rental and sale of modulars to public school districts comprised 25%, 24% and 26% of the Company’s consolidated rental and sales revenues for 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. (For more information, see “Item 1. Business – Relocatable Modular Buildings – Classroom Rentals and Sales to Public Schools (K-12)” above.) Selling and administrative expenses primarily include personnel and benefit costs, which includes share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, bad debt expense, advertising costs, and professional service fees. The Company believes that sharing of common facilities, financing, senior management, and operating and accounting systems by all of the Company’s operations, results in an efficient use of overhead. Historically, the Company’s operating margins have been impacted favorably to the extent its costs and expenses are leveraged over a large installed customer base. However, there can be no assurance as to the Company’s ability to maintain a large installed customer base or ability to sustain its historical operating margins. 33 Recent Developments In February 2020, the Company announced that its board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.42 per common share for the quarter ending March 31, 2020, an increase of 12% over the prior year’s comparable quarter.

Consolidated net income in 2019 increased to $96.8 million, or $3.93 per diluted share in 2019, compared to $79.4 million, or $3.24 per diluted share, in 2018. The Company’s year over year total revenue increase was primarily due to higher rental, rental related services and sales revenues as more fully described below. For 2019 compared to 2018, on a consolidated basis: • Gross profit increased $32.9 million, or 14%, to $266.2 million. Mobile Modular’s gross profit increased $22.9 million, or 19%, due to higher gross profit on rental, rental related services and sales revenues. TRS-RenTelco’s gross profit increased $6.0 million, or 11%, primarily due to higher gross profit on rental revenues. Enviroplex’s gross profit increased $5.0 million, or 53%, due to $10.8 million higher sales revenues and higher gross margins of 37.1% compared to 33.3% in 2018. Adler Tanks’ gross profit decreased $1.0 million, or 2%, due to lower gross profit on rental revenues, partly offset by higher gross profit on rental related services and sales revenues. • Selling and administrative expenses increased $9.0 million, or 8%, to $124.8 million, primarily due to increased salaries and employee benefit costs. • Interest expense was flat at $12.3 million, as 3% higher net average interest rate was offset by 3% lower average debt levels of the Company. • Pre-tax income contribution was 54%, 27% and 11% by Mobile Modular, TRS-RenTelco and Adler Tanks, respectively, in 2019, compared to 53%, 28% and 14%, respectively, in 2018. These results are discussed on a segment basis below. Pre-tax income contribution by Enviroplex was 8% and 5% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. • The provision for income taxes resulted in an effective tax rate of 25.0% and 24.2% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. • Adjusted EBITDA increased $33.7 million, or 17%, to $236.8 million in 2019. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash impairment costs and share-based compensation.

For the year ended December 31, 201 9 compared to the year ended December 31, 201 8 : • Gross Profit on Rental Revenues – Rental revenues increased $23.2 million, or 15%, due to 6% higher average rental equipment on rent and 8% higher average monthly rental rates. As a percentage of rental revenues, depreciation was 12% in 2019 compared to 13% in 2018 and other direct costs were 28% in 2019 and 27% in 2018, which resulted in gross margin percentage of 60% in 2019 and 2018. The higher rental revenues and comparable rental margins resulted in gross profit on rental revenues increasing $14.0 million, or 15%, to $109.1 million in 2019. • Gross Profit on Rental Related Services – Rental related services revenues increased $14.7 million, or 27%, compared to 2018. Most of these service revenues are negotiated with the initial lease and are recognized on a straight-line basis with the associated costs over the initial term of the lease. The increase in rental related services revenues was primarily attributable to higher amortization of modular building delivery and return delivery and dismantle revenues and increased services performed during the lease. The higher revenues and higher gross margin percentage of 25% in 2019 compared to 24% in 2018 resulted in rental related services gross profit increasing $4.6 million, or 35%, to $17.6 million in 2019. • Gross Profit on Sales – Sales revenues increased $7.6 million, or 19%, primarily due to higher new and used equipment sales. The higher sales revenues, together with higher gross margins of 31% in 2019 compared to 29% in 2018, resulted in sales gross profit increasing $3.3 million, or 29%, to $14.6 million in 2019. Sales occur routinely as a normal part of Mobile Modular’s rental business; however, these sales can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer requirements, equipment availability and funding. For 2019, Mobile Modular’s selling and administrative expenses increased $7.7 million, or 13%, to $65.7 million, primarily due to increased employee headcount, salaries and benefit costs and higher allocated corporate expenses. 37 TRS-RenTelco For 2019, TRS-RenTelco’s total revenues increased $12.8 million, or 11%, to $131.5 million compared to 2018, primarily due to higher rental revenues, partly offset by lower sales revenues. Pre-tax income increased $5.5 million, or 19%, to $34.2 million for 2019, primarily due to higher gross profit on rental revenues, partly offset by higher selling and administrative expenses.

For the year ended December 31, 201 9 compared to year ended December 31, 201 8 : • Gross Profit on Rental Revenues – Rental revenues decreased $1.8 million, or 3%, to $67.9 million, due to 8% lower average rental equipment on rent, partly offset by 5% higher average monthly rental rates in 2019 as compared to 2018. As a percentage of rental revenues, depreciation was 24% and 23% in 2019 and 2018, respectively, and other direct costs were 18% and 16% in 2019 and 2018, respectively, which resulted in gross margin percentages of 58% in 2019 compared to 61% in 2018. The lower rental revenues, together with lower rental margins resulted in gross profit on rental revenues decreasing $3.0 million, or 7%, to $39.6 million in 2019. • Gross Profit on Rental Related Services – Rental related services revenues increased $3.5 million, or 14%, compared to 2018, primarily due to increased cleaning and repair revenues. The higher revenues together with higher gross margin percentage of 24% in 2019 compared to 20% in 2018 resulted in rental related services gross profit increasing $1.7 million, or 34%, to $6.7 million in 2019. For 2019, Adler Tanks’ selling and administrative expenses decreased $0.7 million, or 2%, to $29.3 million, primarily due to decreased employee headcount, salaries and benefit costs. 41 Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2018 Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 Overview Consolidated revenues in 2018 increased 8%, to $498.3 million from $462.0 million in 2017. Consolidated net income in 2018 decreased to $79.4 million, or $3.24 per diluted share in 2018, compared to $153.9 million, or $6.34 per diluted share, in 2017. 2017 results included an increase to net income of $102.5 million, or $4.23 per diluted share, due to the tax benefit associated with the enactment by the U.S. government of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 on December 22, 2017 (the “Tax Act”), which is discussed below. The Company’s year over year total revenue increase was primarily due to higher rental and rental related services revenues as more fully described below. For 2018 compared to 2017, on a consolidated basis: • Gross profit increased $26.9 million, or 13%, to $233.3 million. Mobile Modular’s gross profit increased $16.8 million, or 16%, due to higher gross profit on rental, sales and rental related services revenues. Adler Tanks’ gross profit increased $4.8 million, or 11%, due to higher gross profit on rental revenues, partly offset by lower gross profit on sales and rental related services revenues. TRS-RenTelco’s gross profit increased $4.5 million, or 9%, due to higher gross profit on rental and sales revenues. Enviroplex’s gross profit increased $0.8 million, or 9%, primarily due to higher gross margin on sales revenues. • Selling and administrative expenses increased $4.2 million, or 4%, to $115.8 million, primarily due to increased salaries and employee benefit costs across all divisions. • Interest expense increased $0.7 million, or 6%, to $12.3 million, primarily due to 11% higher net average interest rate, partly offset by 5% lower average debt levels of the Company. • Pre-tax income contribution was 53%, 28% and 14% by Mobile Modular, TRS-RenTelco and Adler Tanks, respectively, in 2018, compared to 50%, 31% and 13%, respectively, in 2017. These results are discussed on a segment basis below. Pre-tax income contribution by Enviroplex was 5% and 6% in 2018 and 2017, respectively. • The Tax Act, among other things, reduced the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, and required a one-time mandatory repatriation of foreign earnings. As a result of the Tax Act, the Company re-measured its net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a net benefit of $102.8 million. In addition, a one-time transition income tax estimated at $0.3 million related to repatriation of foreign earnings was recorded. The provision for income taxes resulted in a tax benefit of 84.4% in 2017 compared to a tax provision of 24.2% in 2018. The tax benefit in 2017 was primarily due to the $102.5 million net impact of the Tax Act. In addition, in 2018 the Company benefited from the recording of $2.0 million excess tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation as a reduction to the provision for income taxes compared to $0.9 million in 2017. These tax benefits, or shortfalls, were recorded in equity prior to 2017. • Adjusted EBITDA increased $24.8 million, or 14%, to $203.1 million compared to $178.3 million in 2017. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash impairment costs and share-based compensation. A reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net cash provided by operating activities and net income to Adjusted EBITDA can be found in “Item 6. Selected Financial Data.” on page 33. 42 Mobile Modular For 2018, Mobile Modular’s total revenues increased $23.3 million, or 10%, to $254.6 million compared to 2017, primarily due to higher rental, rental related services and sales revenues. The revenue increase, together with higher gross profit on rental and sales revenues, partly offset by higher selling and administrative expenses, resulted in an increase in pre-tax income of $13.9 million, or 33%, to $55.6 million in 2018. The following table summarizes year-to-year results for each revenue and gross profit category, income from operations, pre-tax income, and other selected information.

For the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017: • Gross Profit on Rental Revenues – Rental revenues increased $16.6 million, or 12%, compared to 2017, due to 3% higher average rental equipment on rent and 8% higher average monthly rental rates. As a percentage of rental revenues, depreciation was 13% in 2018 compared to 15% in 2017 and other direct costs were 27% in 2018 and 29% in 2017, which resulted in gross margin percentage of 60% in 2018 compared to 56% in 2017. Other direct costs in 2017 included a $1.6 million impairment of rental assets, deemed beyond economic repair in the Southern California region. The higher rental revenues and higher rental margins resulted in gross profit on rental revenues increasing 19%, to $95.1 million from $80.0 million in 2017. • Gross Profit on Rental Related Services – Rental related services revenues increased $4.2 million, or 8%, compared to 2017. Most of these service revenues are negotiated with the initial lease and are recognized on a straight-line basis with the associated costs over the initial term of the lease. The increase in rental related services revenues was primarily attributable to higher repair revenue and increased services performed during the lease. The higher revenues, partly offset by lower gross margin percentage of 24% in 2018 compared to 25% in 2017 resulted in rental related services gross profit increasing 2%, to $13.0 million from $12.7 million in 2017. • Gross Profit on Sales – Sales revenues increased $2.0 million, or 5%, compared to 2017. Gross profit on sales increased $1.0 million, or 9%, due to higher used equipment sales revenues and higher gross margins of 29% in 2018 compared to 28% in 2017. Sales occur routinely as a normal part of Mobile Modular’s rental business; however, these sales can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer requirements, equipment availability and funding. For 2018, Mobile Modular’s selling and administrative expenses increased $2.4 million, or 4%, to $58.0 million, primarily due to increased employee salaries and benefit costs and higher allocated corporate expenses. 44 TRS-RenTelco For 2018, TRS-RenTelco’s total revenues increased $10.6 million, or 10%, to $118.7 million compared to 2017, primarily due to higher rental and sales revenues. Pre-tax income increased $2.6 million, or 10%, to $28.8 million for 2018, primarily due to higher gross profit on rental and sales revenues, partly offset by foreign currency exchange loss in 2018 and higher selling and administrative expenses. The following table summarizes year-to-year results for each revenue and gross profit category, income from operations, pre-tax income, and other selected information.

For the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to the year ended December 31, 2017: • Gross Profit on Rental Revenues – Rental revenues increased $7.1 million, or 9%, to $89.9 million with depreciation expense increasing $3.1 million, or 9%, and other direct costs increasing $1.2 million, or 9%, resulting in an increase in gross profit on rental revenues of $2.8 million, or 8%, to $39.2 million in 2018. As a percentage of rental revenues, depreciation was 40% in 2018 and 2017 and other direct costs was 16% in 2018 and 2017, which resulted in gross margin percentage of 44% in 2018 and 2017. The rental revenues increase was due to 9% higher average rental equipment on rent. • Gross Profit on Sales – Sales revenues increased $2.7 million, or 13%, compared to 2017. The lower gross margin percentage of 55% in 2018, compared to 57% in 2017 was primarily due to lower gross margin on new and used equipment sales. The higher sales revenues, partly offset by lower gross margin, resulted in gross profit on sales increasing 9%, to $12.6 million from $11.6 million in 2017. Sales occur routinely as a normal part of TRS-RenTelco’s rental business; however, these sales and related gross margins can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer requirements, equipment availability and funding. For 2018, TRS-RenTelco’s selling and administrative expenses increased $0.7 million, or 3%, to $22.8 million, primarily due to higher salaries and employee benefit costs and higher allocated corporate expenses. 46 Adler Tanks For 2018, Adler Tanks’ total revenues increased $4.7 million, or 5%, to $96.1 million compared to 2017, primarily due to higher rental revenues, partly offset by lower sales revenues during 2018. The revenue increase together with higher gross profit on rental revenues, partly offset by lower gross profit on sales and rental related services revenues, and higher selling and administrative expenses resulted in a pre-tax income increase of $4.2 million, or 39%, to $14.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The following table summarizes year-to-year results for each revenue and gross profit category, income from operations, pre-tax income and other selected information.

For the year ended December 31, 2018 compared to year ended December 31, 2017: • Gross Profit on Rental Revenues – Rental revenues increased $5.7 million, or 9%, to $69.7 million, due to 8% higher average rental equipment on rent and 1% higher average rental rates in 2018 as compared to 2017. As a percentage of rental revenues, depreciation was 23% and 25% in 2018 and 2017, respectively, and other direct costs were 16% and 17% in 2018 and 2017, respectively, which resulted in gross margin percentages of 61% in 2018 compared to 59% in 2017. The higher rental revenues, together with higher rental margins resulted in gross profit on rental revenues increasing $5.0 million, or 13%, to $42.6 million in 2018. • Gross Profit on Rental Related Services – Rental related services revenues increased $0.1 million, or 1%, compared to 2017. Lower gross margin percentage of 20% in 2018 compared to 21% in 2017, partly offset by higher revenue, resulted in rental related services gross profit decreasing $0.1 million, or 1%, to $5.0 million from $5.1 million in 2017. For 2018, Adler Tanks’ selling and administrative expenses increased $0.5 million, or 2% to $30.0 million from $29.5 million in the same period in 2017, primarily due to increased employee headcount, salaries and benefit costs. 48 Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company’s rental businesses are capital intensive and generate significant cash flows. Cash flows for the Company in 2019 as compared to 2018 are summarized as follows: Cash Flows from Operating Activities: The Company’s operations provided net cash flow of $188.0 million for 2019 as compared to $142.7 million in 2018. The 32% increase was primarily attributable to higher operating profit, increased accounts payable and accrued liabilities and other balance sheet changes. Cash Flows from Investing Activities: Net cash used in investing activities was $143.1 million for 2019 as compared to $104.5 million in 2018. The $38.6 million increase was primarily due to $44.6 million higher purchases of rental equipment of $167.7 million in 2019, compared to $123.1 million in 2018, partly offset by $3.6 million lower purchases of property, plant and equipment and $2.7 million higher proceeds from sales of used rental equipment. Cash Flows from Financing Activities: Net cash used in financing activities was $44.0 million in 2019 as compared to $39.1 million in 2018. The $4.9 million increase was primarily due to $20.3 million lower net borrowings under bank lines of credit and $4.6 million higher dividend payments, partly offset by $20.0 million lower payment of principal Series A Senior Notes. Significant capital expenditures are required to maintain and grow the Company’s rental assets. During the last three years, the Company has financed its working capital and capital expenditure requirements through cash flow from operations, proceeds from the sale of rental equipment and from bank borrowings. Sales occur routinely as a normal part of the Company’s rental businesses. However, these sales can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer requirements and funding. Although the net proceeds received from sales may fluctuate from period to period, the Company believes its liquidity will not be adversely impacted from lower sales in any given year because it believes it has the ability to increase its bank borrowings, offer additional notes and conserve its cash in the future by reducing the amount of cash it uses to purchase rental equipment, pay dividends, or repurchase the Company’s common stock. As the following table indicates, cash flow provided by operating activities and proceeds from sales of used rental equipment have been greater than rental equipment purchases over the past three years. Funding of Rental Asset Growth (amounts in thousands) Year Ended December 31, Three Year 2019 2018 2017 Totals Cash provided by operating activities $ 187,994 $ 142,667 $ 122,389 $ 453,050 Proceeds from sales of used rental equipment 44,447 41,786 38,344 124,577 Cash available for purchase of rental equipment 232,441 184,453 160,733 577,627 Purchases of rental equipment (167,703 ) (123,071 ) (94,579 ) (385,353 ) Cash paid for acquisition of business assets (7,808 ) (7,543 ) — (15,351 ) Cash available for other uses $ 56,930 $ 53,839 $ 66,154 $ 176,923 In addition to increasing its rental assets, the Company had other capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment of $12.1 million in 2019, $15.7 million in 2018 and $14.6 million in 2017, and has used cash to provide returns to its shareholders in the form of cash dividends. The Company paid cash dividends of $35.5 million, $30.9 million and $24.9 million in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The Company has in the past made repurchases of shares of its common stock from time to time in the over-the-counter market (NASDAQ) and/or through privately negotiated, block transactions under an authorization from the Board of Directors. Shares repurchased by the Company are canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued stock. There were no repurchases of common stock during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. As of February 25, 2020, 1,592,026 shares remain authorized for repurchase. Unsecured Revolving Lines of Credit In March 2016, the Company renewed its credit agreement with a syndicate of banks (the “Credit Facility”). The five-year facility matures on March 31, 2021 and replaced the Company’s prior $420.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility. The Credit Facility provides for a $420.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (which may be increased to $620.0 million with $200.0 million of additional commitments), which includes a $25.0 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a $10.0 million sublimit for swingline loans. 49 In March 2016, the Company entered into a Credit Facility Letter Agreement and a Credit Line Note in favor of MUFG Union Bank, N.A., extending its line of credit facility related to its cash management services (“Sweep Service Facility”) and increasing the facility size from $10.0 million to $12.0 million. The Sweep Service Facility matures on the earlier of March 31, 2021, or the date the Company ceases to utilize MUFG Union Bank, N.A. for its cash management services. At December 31, 2019, under the Credit Facility and Sweep Service Facility, the Company had unsecured lines of credit that permit it to borrow up to $432.0 million of which $193.5 million was outstanding, and had capacity to borrow up to an additional $238.5 million. The Credit Facility contains financial covenants requiring the Company to not (all defined terms used below not otherwise defined herein have the meaning assigned to such terms in the Amended Credit Facility): • Permit the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges as of the end of any fiscal quarter to be less than 2.50 to 1. At December 31, 2019, the actual ratio was 4.27 to 1. • Permit the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of funded debt to EBITDA at any time during any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters to be greater than 2.75 to 1. At December 31, 2019, the actual ratio was 1.24 to 1. • Permit Tangible Net Worth as of the end of any fiscal quarter of the Company to be less than the sum of (i) $246.1 million plus (ii) 25% of the Company’s Consolidated Net Income (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility) (but only if a positive number) for each fiscal quarter ended subsequent to December 31, 2011 plus (iii) 90% of the net cash proceeds from the issuance of the Company’s capital stock after December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2019, such sum was $388.1 million and the actual Tangible Net Worth of the Company was $598.5 million. At December 31, 2019, the Company was in compliance with each of the aforementioned covenants. There are no anticipated trends that the Company is aware of that would indicate non-compliance with these covenants, although significant deterioration in our financial performance could impact the Company’s ability to comply with these covenants. 3.68% Senior Notes Due in 2021 On March 17, 2014, the Company issued and sold to the Purchasers a $40.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.68% Series B Senior Notes (the “Series B Senior Notes”) pursuant to the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement, as amended. The Series B Senior Notes are an unsecured obligation of the Company and bear interest at a rate of 3.68% per annum and mature on March 17, 2021. Interest on the Series B Senior Notes is payable semi-annually beginning on September 17, 2014 and continuing thereafter on March 17 and September 17 of each year until maturity. The principal balance is due when the notes mature in 2021. The full net proceeds from the Series B Senior Notes were used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2019, the principal balance outstanding under the Series B Senior Notes was $40.0 million. 3.84% Senior Notes Due in 2022 On November 5, 2015, the Company issued and sold to the Purchasers a $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.84% Series C Senior Notes (the “Series C Senior Notes”) pursuant to the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement, as amended. The Series C Senior Notes are an unsecured obligation of the Company and bear interest at a rate of 3.84% per annum and mature on November 5, 2022. Interest on the Series C Senior Notes is payable semi-annually beginning on May 5, 2016 and continuing thereafter on November 5 and May 5 of each year until maturity. The principal balance is due when the notes mature in 2022. The full net proceeds from the Series C Senior Notes were used to reduce the outstanding balance on the Company’s revolving credit line. At December 31, 2019, the principal balance outstanding under the Series C Senior Notes was $60.0 million. Among other restrictions, the Note Purchase Agreement, under which the Series B Senior Notes and Series C Senior Notes were sold, contains financial covenants requiring the Company to not (all defined terms used below not otherwise defined herein have the meaning assigned to such terms in the Note Purchase Agreement): • Permit the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of EBITDA (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) to fixed charges as of the end of any fiscal quarter to be less than 2.50 to 1. At December 31, 2019, the actual ratio was 4.27 to 1. • Permit the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of funded debt to EBITDA (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) at any time during any period of four consecutive quarters to be greater than 2.75 to 1. At December 31, 2019, the actual ratio was 1.24 to 1. • Permit tangible net worth, calculated as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, to be less than the sum of (i) $229.0 million, plus (ii) 25% of net income for such fiscal quarter subsequent to December 31, 2010, plus (iii) 90% of the net cash proceeds from the issuance of the Company’s capital stock after December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2019, such sum was $388.1 million and the actual tangible net worth of the Company was $598.5 million. 50 At December 31, 201 9 , the Company was in compliance with each of the aforementioned covenants. There are no anticipated trends that the Company is aware of that would indicate non-compliance with these covenants, although significant deterioration in our financial performance could impact the Company’s ability to comply with these covenants. Although no assurance can be given, the Company believes it will continue to be able to negotiate general bank lines of credit and issue senior notes adequate to meet capital requirements not otherwise met by operational cash flows and proceeds from sales of rental equipment. Contractual Obligations and Commitments At December 31, 2019, the Company’s material contractual obligations and commitments consisted of outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities expiring in 2021, outstanding amounts under our 3.68% and 3.84% senior notes due in 2021 and 2022, respectively, and operating leases for facilities. The operating lease amounts exclude property taxes and insurance. The table below provides a summary of the Company’s contractual obligations and reflects expected payments due as of December 31, 2019 and does not reflect changes that could arise after that date. Payments Due by Period (dollar amounts in thousands) Total Within 1 Year Within 2 to 3 Years Within 4 to 5 Years More than 5 Years Revolving lines of credit $ 193,459 $ — $ 193,459 $ — $ — 3.68% Series B senior notes due in 2021 42,944 1,472 41,472 — — 3.84% Series C senior notes due in 2022 66,918 2,310 64,608 — — Operating leases for facilities 9,495 2,732 4,175 2,295 293 Total contractual obligations $ 312,816 $ 6,514 $ 303,714 $ 2,295 $ 293 The Company believes that its needs for working capital and capital expenditures through 2019 and beyond will be adequately met by operating cash flow, proceeds from the sale of rental equipment, and bank borrowings.

Critical Accounting Policies In response to the SEC’s Release No. 33-8040, “Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies,” the Company has identified the most critical accounting policies upon which its financial status depends. The Company determined its critical accounting policies by considering those policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments. The Company has identified that its most critical accounting policies are those related to revenue recognition, depreciation, maintenance, repair and refurbishment, impairment of rental equipment and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. Descriptions of these accounting policies are found in both the notes to the consolidated financial statements and at relevant sections in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis. Revenue recognition: Lease revenue - Rental revenues from operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease for all operating segments. Rental billings for periods extending beyond period end are recorded as deferred income and are recognized in the period earned. Rental related services revenues are primarily associated with relocatable modular building and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes leases. For modular building leases, rental related services revenues for modifications, delivery, installation, dismantle and return delivery are lease related because the payments are considered minimum lease payments that are an integral part of the negotiated lease agreement with the customer. These revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain leases are accounted for as sales-type leases. For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment. Other revenues include interest income on sales-type leases and rental income on facility leases. Non-lease revenue - Sales revenue is recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment to customers. Certain leases are accounted for as sales-type leases. For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment. The Company typically recognizes non-lease related revenues at a point in time because the customer does not simultaneously consume the benefits of the Company’s promised goods and services, or 51 performance obligations, and obtain control when delivery and installation are complete. For contracts that have multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in the contract based on the Company’s best estimate of the standalone selling prices of each distinct performance obligation in the contract. The standalone selling price is typically determined based upon the expected cost plus an estimated margin of each performance obligation. Depreciation - The estimated useful lives and estimated residual values used for rental equipment are based on the Company’s experience as to the economic useful life and sale value of its products. Additionally, to the extent information is publicly available, the Company also compares its depreciation policies to other companies with similar rental products for reasonableness. The lives and residual values of rental equipment are subject to periodic evaluation. For modular equipment, external factors to consider may include, but are not limited to, changes in legislation, regulations, building codes, local permitting, and supply or demand. Internal factors for modulars may include, but are not limited to, change in equipment specifications, condition of equipment, or maintenance policies. For electronic test equipment, external factors to consider may include, but are not limited to, technological advances, changes in manufacturers’ selling prices, and supply or demand. Internal factors for electronic test equipment may include, but are not limited to, change in equipment specifications, condition of equipment or maintenance policies. For liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes, external factors to consider may include, but are not limited to, changes in Federal and State legislation, the types of materials stored and the frequency of movements and uses. Internal factors for liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes may include, but are not limited to, change in equipment specifications and maintenance policies. Changes in useful lives or residual values will impact depreciation expense and any gain or loss from the sale of used equipment. Depending on the magnitude of such changes, the impact on the financial statements could be significant. Maintenance, repair and refurbishment - Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The direct material and labor costs of value-added additions or major refurbishment of modular buildings are capitalized to the extent the refurbishment significantly improves the quality and adds value or life to the equipment. Judgment is involved as to when these costs should be capitalized. The Company’s policies narrowly limit the capitalization of value-added items to specific additions such as restrooms, sidewalls and ventilation upgrades. In addition, only major refurbishment costs incurred near the end of the estimated useful life of the rental equipment, which extend its useful life, and are subject to certain limitations, are capitalized. Changes in these policies could impact the Company’s financial results. Impairment of rental equipment - The carrying value of the Company’s rental equipment is its capitalized cost less accumulated depreciation. To the extent events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value cannot be recovered, an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carrying value to fair value. The Company determines fair value based upon the condition of the equipment and the projected net cash flows from its rental and sale considering current market conditions. Additionally, if the Company decides to sell or otherwise dispose of the rental equipment, it is carried at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell or dispose. Due to uncertainties inherent in the valuation process and market conditions, it is reasonably possible that actual results of operating and disposing of rental equipment could be materially different than current expectations. Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets - The Company assesses the carrying amount of its recorded goodwill and intangible assets annually or in interim periods if circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. The impairment review is performed by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. The two-step process requires management to make certain judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation. The first step in the evaluation consists of estimating the fair value of the reporting unit based on discounted cash flows using revenue and after tax profit estimates. Management then compares its estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit with the reporting unit’s carrying amount, which includes goodwill and intangible assets. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, then goodwill and intangible assets are not impaired and no further testing is required. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit were to exceed its fair value, then the second step is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill and intangible assets and an impairment loss is recorded for an amount equal to the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the goodwill and intangible assets. Impact of Inflation Although the Company cannot precisely determine the effect of inflation, from time to time it has experienced increases in costs of rental equipment, manufacturing costs, operating expenses and interest. Because a majority of its rentals are relatively short-term, the Company has generally been able to pass on such increased costs through increases in rental rates and selling prices, but there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to pass on increased costs to customers in the future. 52 Off Balance Sheet Transactions As of December 31, 2019, the Company did not have any “off-balance-sheet arrangements,” as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. The Company is exposed to cash flow and fair value risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to its 3.68% and 3.84% senior notes due in 2021 and 2022, respectively, and its revolving lines of credit. Weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at December 31, 2019.

The Company commenced the closure of its Indian operations during 2017. The Canadian operations of the Company subject it to foreign currency risks (i.e. the possibility that the financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates). Currently, the Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge its economic exposure with respect to assets, liabilities and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In 2019, the Company experienced minimal impact on net income due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Although there can be no assurances, given the size of the Canadian operations, the Company does not expect future foreign exchange gains and losses to be significant. The Company has no derivative financial instruments that expose the Company to significant market risk. 53 ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA. Index Page Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting 55 Reports of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm 56 Consolidated Financial Statements Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 59 Consolidated Statements of Income for the Years Ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 60 Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the Years Ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 61 Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity for the Years Ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 62 Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the Years Ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 63 Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 64 54 Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting The Company’s management is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the consolidated financial statements appearing in our Annual Report filed on Form 10-K. The consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles and include amounts based on management’s estimates and judgments. All other financial information in this report has been presented on a basis consistent with the information included in the financial statements. The Company’s management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company maintains a system of internal control that is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliable preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements, as well as to safeguard assets from unauthorized use or disposition. The Company’s system of internal control over financial reporting is embodied in the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. It sets the tone of our organization and includes factors such as integrity and ethical values. Our internal control over financial reporting is supported by formal policies and procedures, which are reviewed, modified and improved as changes occur in business conditions and operations. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed solely of outside directors, meets periodically with members of management and the independent auditors to review and discuss internal control over financial reporting, as well as accounting and financial reporting matters. The independent auditors report to the Audit Committee and accordingly have full and free access to the Audit Committee at any time. The Company’s management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 based on the criteria set forth in the 2013 Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on its evaluation, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2019, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. 55 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Board of Directors and Shareholders McGrath RentCorp Opinion on internal control over financial reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of McGrath RentCorp (a California corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by COSO. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements of the Company as of and for the year ended December 31, 2019, and our report dated February 25, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and limitations of internal control over financial reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP San Jose, California February 25, 2020 56 Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm Board of Directors and Shareholders McGrath RentCorp Opinion on the financial statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of McGrath RentCorp (a California corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”), and our report dated February 25, 2020 expressed an unqualified opinion. Basis for opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical audit matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Valuation of TRS-RenTelco rental equipment As described further in note 1 to the financial statements, the Company evaluates the carrying value of rental equipment for impairment whenever events and circumstances have occurred that would indicate the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. We identified the valuation of the Company’s TRS-RenTelco rental equipment as a critical audit matter. The principal consideration for our determination of the valuation of the TRS-RenTelco rental equipment as a critical audit matter is that the TRS-RenTelco rental equipment can be sensitive to new developments in technology, which creates the risk that equipment could become obsolete or impaired. Management’s impairment analysis relies on estimates of future financial performance of its rental equipment. These estimates include assumptions based upon historical and projected results including utilization, rental pricing and the equipment’s useful life and expected sales proceeds. The failure to achieve these projections might be indicators of potential impairment. Our audit procedures related to the impairment of TRS-RenTelco rental equipment included the following, among others. • We tested the design and operating effectiveness of controls relating to the impairment process, determination of the assumptions, and review of equipment that didn’t meet assumed performance thresholds. • We evaluated the appropriateness of useful lives assigned to the rental equipment. 57 • We analyzed trends in utilization and yield at a disaggregated product level, both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter to evaluate if indicators of impairment were present for any particular product. • For a sample of assets, we inspected underlying documents and compared to the information in management’s analysis for accuracy. • We independently identified any underperforming assets by recalculating management’s analysis performed by using actual margins on sales proceeds. • For assets discussed above, we inquired of management with respect to the assets and factors driving assessment of realizability and corroborated explanations received. /s/ GRANT THORNTON LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Organization McGrath RentCorp and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the “Company”) is a California corporation organized in 1979. The Company is a diversified business to business rental company with four rental divisions; relocatable modular buildings, portable storage containers, electronic test equipment and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes. Although the Company’s primary emphasis is on equipment rentals, sales of equipment occur in the normal course of business. The Company is comprised of four reportable business segments: modular building and portable storage segment (“Mobile Modular”), electronic test equipment segment (“TRS-RenTelco”), containment solutions for the storage of hazardous and non-hazardous liquids and solids segment (“Adler Tanks”) and classroom manufacturing division selling modular classrooms in California (“Enviroplex”). Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of McGrath RentCorp and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Revenue Recognition Lease revenues - Rental revenues from operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease for all operating segments. Rental billings for periods extending beyond period end are recorded as deferred income and are recognized in the period earned. Rental related services revenues are primarily associated with relocatable modular building and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes leases. For modular building leases, rental related services revenues for modifications, delivery, installation, dismantle and return delivery are lease related because the payments are considered minimum lease payments that are an integral part of the negotiated lease agreement with the customer. These revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain leases are accounted for as sales-type leases. For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment. Other revenues include interest income on sales-type leases and rental income on facility leases. Non-lease revenues - Sales revenue is recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment to customers. Certain leases are accounted for as sales-type leases. For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment. Other revenue is recognized when earned and primarily includes interest income on sales-type leases, rental income on facility leases and certain logistics services. Sales taxes charged to customers are reported on a net basis and are excluded from revenues and expenses. Depreciation of Rental Equipment Rental equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis for financial reporting purposes and on an accelerated basis for income tax purposes. The costs of major refurbishment of relocatable modular buildings, portable storage containers and tanks and boxes are capitalized to the extent the refurbishment significantly adds value to, or extends the life of the equipment. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The estimated useful lives and residual values of the Company’s rental equipment used for financial reporting purposes are as follows: Relocatable modular buildings 18 years, 50% residual value Relocatable modular accessories 3 to 18 years, no residual value Blast resistant modules 20 years, no residual value Portable storage containers 25 years, 62.5% residual value Electronic test equipment and accessories 1 to 8 years, no residual value Liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes and accessories 3 to 20 years, no residual value -64- Costs of Rental Related Services Costs of rental related services are primarily associated with relocatable modular building leases and liquid and solid containment tank and boxes. Modular building leases primarily consist of costs for services to be provided under the negotiated lease agreement for delivery, installation, modifications, skirting, additional site-related work, and dismantle and return delivery. Costs related to these services are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Costs of rental related services associated with liquid and solid containment solutions consists of costs of delivery, removal and cleaning of the tanks and boxes. These costs are recognized in the period the service is performed. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company evaluates the carrying value of rental equipment and identifiable definite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances have occurred that would indicate the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. A key element in determining the recoverability of long-lived assets is the Company’s outlook as to the future market conditions for its rental equipment. If the carrying amount is not fully recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carrying amount to fair value. The Company determines fair value based upon the condition of the rental equipment and the projected net cash flows from its rental and sale considering current market conditions. Goodwill and identifiable indefinite lived assets are evaluated for potential impairment annually or when circumstances indicate potential impairment may have occurred. Impairment losses, if any, are determined based upon the excess of carrying value over the estimated fair value of the asset. There were no impairments of long-lived assets during the year ended December 31, 2019. The Company recorded an impairment of modular rental equipment of $ 0.1 million and $ 1.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Other Direct Costs of Rental Operations Other direct costs of rental operations include direct labor, supplies, repairs, insurance, property taxes, license fees, impairment of rental equipment and certain modular lease costs charged to customers in the negotiated rental rate, which are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Cost of Sales Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income includes the carrying value of the equipment sold and all direct costs associated with the sale. Warranty Reserves Sales of new relocatable modular buildings, portable storage containers, electronic test equipment and related accessories and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes not manufactured by the Company are typically covered by warranties provided by the manufacturer of the products sold. The Company typically provides limited 90 -day warranties for certain sales of used rental equipment and one-year warranties on equipment manufactured by Enviroplex. Although the Company’s policy is to provide reserves for warranties when required for specific circumstances, the Company has not found it necessary to establish such reserves to date as warranty costs have not been significant. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis for financial reporting purposes, and on an accelerated basis for income tax purposes. Depreciation expense for property, plant and equipment is included in “Selling and administrative expenses” and “Rental related services” in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. -65- Property, plant and equipment consist of the following: (dollar amounts in thousands) Estimated useful life December 31, in years 2019 2018 Land Indefinite $ 54,423 $ 50,689 Land improvements 20 – 50 52,325 50,064 Buildings 30 29,848 29,359 Furniture, office and computer equipment 3 – 10 36,610 33,081 Vehicles and machinery 5 – 25 41,877 38,199 215,083 201,392 Less accumulated depreciation ( 84,308 ) ( 77,118 ) 130,775 124,274 Construction in progress 272 2,625 $ 131,047 $ 126,899 Property, plant and equipment depreciation expense was $ 8.2 million, $ 8.0 million and $ 7.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Construction in progress at December 31, 2019 and 2018 consisted primarily of costs related to acquisition of land and land improvements and information technology upgrades. Capitalized Software Costs The Company capitalizes certain development costs incurred in connection with its internal use software. Costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as incurred. Once an application has reached the development stage, direct internal and external costs are capitalized until the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. These costs generally include external direct costs of materials and services consumed in the project and internal costs, such as payroll and benefits of those employees directly associated with the development of the software. Maintenance, training and post implementation costs are expensed as incurred. The Company also capitalizes costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality. Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and equipment. The Company capitalized $ 3.0 million and $ 0.1 million in internal use software during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Total advertising expenses were $ 3.6 million, $ 3.2 million and $ 2.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the effect of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are adjusted to the extent necessary to reflect tax rates expected to be in effect when temporary differences reverse. Adjustments may be required to deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities due to changes in tax laws and audit adjustments by tax authorities. A valuation allowance would be established if, based on the weight of available evidence, management believes that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a recorded deferred tax asset would not be realized in future periods. To the extent adjustments are required in any given period, the adjustments would be included within the “Provision for income taxes” in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Purchase prices of acquired businesses are allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based on the estimated fair values on the respective acquisition dates. Based on these values, the excess purchase prices over the fair value of the net assets acquired are allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets. Intangible assets related to customer relationships are amortized over eleven years . At December 31, 2019 and 2018, goodwill and trade name intangible assets which have indefinite lives totaled $ 34.1 million and $ 33.7 million, respectively. The Company assesses potential impairment of its goodwill and intangible assets when there is evidence that events or circumstances have occurred that would indicate the recovery of an asset’s carrying value is unlikely. The Company also assesses -66- potential impairment of its goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives on an annual basis regardless of whether there is evidence of impairment. If indicators of impairment were to be present in intangible assets used in operations and future discounted cash flows were not expected to be sufficient to recover the assets’ carrying amount, an impairment loss would be charged to expense in the period identified. The amount of an impairment loss would be recognized as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. Factors the Company considers important, which may cause impairment include, among others, significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired asset, negative industry or economic trends, and significant underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results. The impairment review of the Company’s goodwill is performed by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step impairment test. In the first step, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value to determine if the goodwill is impaired. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, then goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is required. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit were to exceed its fair value, then the second step is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill and an impairment loss is recorded for an amount equal to the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the goodwill. The Company conducted its annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of its fiscal year. The impairment analysis did no t result in an impairment charge for the fiscal years ended 2019, 2018 or 2017. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The Company based its fair value estimates on assumptions that it believes are reasonable but are uncertain and subject to changes in market conditions. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed as net income divided by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is computed assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive securities including the dilutive effects of stock options, unvested restricted stock awards and other potentially dilutive securities. The table below presents the weighted-average common stock used to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share: (in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Weighted-average common stock for calculating basic earnings per share 24,250 24,141 23,999 Effect of potentially dilutive securities from equity-based compensation 373 399 270 Weighted-average common stock for calculating diluted earnings per share 24,623 24,540 24,269 In 2017, there were 7,000 options to purchase common stock that were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share, as their effect would have been anti-dilutive. There were no shares excluded in 2019 and 2018. The Company has in the past made purchases of shares of its common stock from time to time in over-the-counter market (NASDAQ) transactions, through privately negotiated, large block transactions and through a share repurchase plan, in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In August 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase 2,000,000 shares of the Company's outstanding common stock. The amount and time of the specific repurchases are subject to prevailing market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors, including management’s discretion. All shares repurchased by the Company are canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares of common stock. There can be no assurance that any authorized shares will be repurchased and the repurchase program may be modified, extended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. There were no repurchases of common stock during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. As of December 31, 2019, 1,592,026 shares remain authorized for repurchase. Accounts Receivable and Concentration of Credit Risk The Company’s accounts receivable consist of amounts due from customers for rentals, sales, financed sales and unbilled amounts for the portion of modular building end-of-lease services earned, which were negotiated as part of the lease agreement. Unbilled receivables related to end-of-lease services, which consists of dismantle and return delivery of buildings, were $ 37.2 million at December 31, 2019 and $ 32.3 million at December 31, 2018. The Company sells primarily on 30 -day terms, individually performs -67- credit evaluation procedures on its customers on each transaction and will require security deposits from its customers when a significant credit risk is identified. The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts in amounts equal to the estimated losses expected to be incurred in the collection of the accounts receivable. The estimated losses are based on historical collection experience in conjunction with an evaluation of the current status of the existing accounts. Customer accounts are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when an account is determined to be uncollectable. The allowance for doubtful accounts activity was as follows: (in thousands) 2019 2018 Beginning balance, January 1 $ 1,883 $ 1,920 Provision for doubtful accounts 1,013 581 Write-offs, net of recoveries ( 1,013 ) ( 618 ) Ending balance, December 31 $ 1,883 $ 1,883 Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts receivable. From time to time, the Company maintains cash balances in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company believes that the carrying amounts for cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and notes payable approximate their fair values except for fixed rate debt included in notes payable which has an estimated fair value of $ 101.4 million and $ 99.0 million compared to the recorded value of $ 100.0 million as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The estimates of fair value of the Company’s fixed rate debt are based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for bank loans with similar terms and average maturities. Foreign Currency Transactions and Translation The Company's Canadian subsidiary, TRS-RenTelco Inc., a British Columbia corporation (“TRS-Canada”), functions as a branch sales office for TRS-RenTelco in Canada. The functional currency for TRS-Canada is the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses of TRS-Canada are reported in the results of operations in the period in which they occur. The Company’s Indian subsidiary, TRS-RenTelco India Private Limited (“TRS-India”), functioned as a rental and sales office for TRS-RenTelco in India, which commenced its closure during 2017. The functional currency for TRS-India is the Indian Rupee. All assets and liabilities of TRS-India are translated into U.S. dollars at period-end exchange rates and all income statement amounts are translated at the average exchange rate for each month within the year. Currently, the Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge its economic exposure with respect to assets, liabilities and firm commitments as the foreign currency transactions and risks to date have not been significant. Share-Based Compensation The Company measures and recognizes the compensation expense for all share-based awards made to employees and directors, including stock options, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) and restricted stock units (“RSUs”), based upon estimated fair values. The fair value of stock options and SARs is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and for RSUs based upon the fair market value of the underlying shares of common stock as of the date of grant. The Company recognizes share-based compensation cost ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which generally equals the vesting period. For performance-based RSUs, compensation costs are recognized when vesting conditions are met. In addition, the Company estimates the probable number of shares of common stock that will be earned and the corresponding compensation cost until the achievement of the performance goal is known. The Company records share-based compensation costs in “Selling and administrative expenses” in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company recognizes a benefit from share-based compensation in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity if an incremental tax benefit is realized. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in “Note 6 –Benefit Plans”. Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions in determining reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each period presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The most significant estimates included in the financial statements are the future cash flows and fair values used to determine the recoverability of the rental equipment and -68- identifiable definite lived intangible assets carrying value, the various assets’ useful lives and residual values, and the allowance for doubtful accounts. NOTE 2. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) 2016-13, Financial Instruments – Credit Losses (Topic 326), requiring companies to present assets held at amortized cost and available for sale debt securities net of the amount expected to be collected. This new guidance requires the measurement of expected credit losses to be based on relevant information from past events, including historical experiences, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect collectability. This guidance does not apply to receivables arising from operating leases and will be effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after December 15, 2019. The Company does not expect the adoption of this ASU to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, expected to reduce cost and complexity related to the accounting for income taxes. The ASU removes specific exceptions to the general principles in Topic 740 in Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). It eliminates the need for an organization to analyze whether the following apply in a given period: exception to the incremental approach for intra-period tax allocation; exceptions to accounting for basis differences when there are ownership changes in foreign investments; and exception in interim period income tax accounting for year-to-date losses that exceed anticipated losses. The ASU also improves financial statement preparers’ application of income tax-related guidance and simplifies GAAP for: franchise taxes that are partially based on income; transactions with a government that result in a step up in the tax basis of goodwill; separate financial statements of legal entities that are not subject to tax; and enacted changes in tax laws in interim periods. The Company is evaluating the impact of this guidance on its consolidated financial statements. NOTE 3. IMPLEMENTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Lessee The Company adopted ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Subtopic 842-10) effective January 1, 2019. Under the new guidance, lessees are required to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) on the commencement date: a) lease liability, which is a lessee’s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and b) right-of-use (“ROU”) asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee’s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. The Company adopted the new guidance using the transition method that allowed it to initially apply this guidance on the adoption date. The adoption did not result in a cumulative-effect adjustment to the Company’s opening retained earnings. Because of the transition method the Company used to adopt the new guidance, historical financial information was not updated and the financial disclosures required under the new standard are not provided for periods prior to January 1, 2019. The new guidance contains additional optional transition practical expedients intended to simplify adoption. The Company elected the package of practical expedients that allows for not reassessing: (1) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (2) the lease classification for any expired or existing leases and (3) initial direct costs for any expired or existing leases. The Company leases real estate for certain of its branch offices and rental equipment storage yards, vehicles and equipment used in its rental operations. The Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. The Company has leases with lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for separately. ROU assets and liabilities are recognized on the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Variable lease payments are excluded from the ROU assets and lease liabilities and are recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred, which are not material. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. The Company uses the interest rate stated in the lease as the discount rate. If the interest rate is not stated, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on information available on lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Many of the Company’s real estate lease agreements include options to extend the lease, which are not included in the minimum lease terms unless they are reasonably certain to be exercised. These leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that may extend the lease term from one to three years . The amount of payments associated with such options is not material. Short-term leases are leases having a term of twelve months or less and exclude leases with a lease term of one month or less. The Company recognizes short-term leases on a straight-line basis and does not record a related ROU asset or liability for such leases. The adoption of the new guidance resulted in the recording of $ 10.0 million of ROU assets and operating lease liabilities, which were recorded in Prepaid expenses and other assets and Accounts payable and accrued liabilities on the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet. During the year ended December 31, 2019, operating lease expense was $ 3.8 million, which includes short term lease expense of $ 0.2 million. At December 31, 2019, the weighted-average remaining lease term for operating leases was 3.8 years and the -69- weighted average discount rate was 4.38 %. The Company had no sub-lease income during the year ended December 31 , 2019, and did no t have any finance leases as of December 31 , 2019. Supplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows: (in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2019 Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities: Operating cash flows from operating leases $ 3,568 Right of use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations: Operating leases $ 2,728 As of December 31, 2019, maturities of operating lease liabilities were as follows: (in thousands) Year ended December 31, 2020 $ 3,350 2021 2,794 2022 1,958 2023 1,458 2024 915 Thereafter 293 Total lease payments 10,768 Less imputed interest ( 823 ) $ 9,945 Lessor As a lessor, the Company’s recognition of lease revenue remained consistent with previous guidance. As a result, the adoption of the lease standard did not have an impact on the Company’s current and previously reported results in the Company’s Condensed Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company’s equipment rentals for each of its operating segments are governed by agreements that detail the lease terms and conditions. The determination of whether these contracts with customers contain a lease generally does not require significant judgement. The Company accounts for these rentals as operating leases. These leases do not include material amounts of variable payments and the Company has made the accounting policy election to exclude all taxes assessed by a governmental authority. The Company generally does not provide an option for the lessee to purchase the rented equipment at the end of the lease term, thus, does not generate material revenue from sales of equipment under such options. Initial lease terms vary in length based upon customer needs and generally range from one to sixty months . Customers have the option to keep equipment on rent beyond the initial lease term on a month-to month basis based upon their needs. All of the Company’s rental products have long useful lives relative to the typical rental term with the original investment typically recovered in approximately three to five years . The rental products are typically rented for a majority of the time owned and a significant portion of the original investment is recovered when sold from inventory. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain residual value guarantees or restrictive covenants. As of December 31, 2019, maturities of operating lease payments to be received in 2020 and thereafter were as follows: (in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2020 $ 92,821 2021 30,926 2022 8,922 2023 2,145 2024 877 Thereafter 37 $ 135,728 -70- In the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company’s lease revenues were $ 411.0 million, consisting of $ 407.6 of operating lease revenues and $ 3.4 million of finance lease revenues. The Company has entered into finance leases to finance certain equipment sales to customers. The lease agreements have a bargain purchase option at the end of the lease term. For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis, which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment. For the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company’s finance lease revenues included $ 3.1 million of sales revenues and $ 0.3 million of interest income. The minimum lease payments receivable and the net investment are included in Accounts receivable on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet for such leases, which were as follows: (in thousands) December 31, 2019 Gross minimum lease payments receivable $ 3,218 Less – unearned interest ( 289 ) Net investment in finance lease receivables $ 2,929 As of December 31, 2019, the future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable finance leases to be received in 2020 and thereafter were as follows: (in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2020 $ 2,345 2021 629 2022 184 2023 50 2024 10 Thereafter — Total minimum future lease payments to be received $ 3,218 NOTE 4. REVENUE RECOGNITION The Company’s accounting for revenues is governed by two accounting standards. The majority of the Company’s revenues are considered lease or lease related and are accounted for in accordance with Topic 840, Leases. Revenues determined to be non-lease related are accounted for in accordance with ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2018. The Company utilized the modified retrospective method of adoption and there was no impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements, nor was there a cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard. The Company accounts for revenues when approval and commitment from both parties have been obtained, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. The Company typically recognizes non-lease related revenues at a point in time because the customer does not simultaneously consume the benefits of the Company’s promised goods and services, or performance obligations, and obtain control when delivery and installation are complete. For contracts that have multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in the contract based on the Company’s best estimate of the standalone selling prices of each distinct performance obligation in the contract. The standalone selling price is typically determined based upon the expected cost plus an estimated margin of each performance obligation. The Company generally rents and sells to customers on 30 day payment terms. The Company does not typically offer variable payment terms, or accept non-monetary consideration. Amounts billed and due from the Company’s customers are classified as Accounts receivable on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. For certain sales of modular buildings, progress payments from the customer are received during the manufacturing of new equipment, or the preparation of used equipment. The advance payments are not considered a significant financing component because the payments are used to meet working capital needs during the contract and to protect the Company from the customer failing to adequately complete their obligations under the contract. These contract liabilities are included in Deferred income on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet and totaled $ 17.5 million and $ 15.7 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Sales revenues totaling $ 10.2 million were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019, which were included in the contract liability balance at December 31, 2018. For certain modular building sales, the customer retains a small portion of the contract price until full completion of the contract, which results in revenue earned in excess of billings. These unbilled contract assets are included in Accounts receivable on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet and totaled $ 1.0 million and $ 1.4 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. -71- Lease Revenues Rental revenues from operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease for all operating segments. Rental billings for periods extending beyond period end are recorded as deferred income and are recognized in the period earned. Rental related services revenues are primarily associated with relocatable modular building and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes leases. For modular building leases, rental related services revenues for modifications, delivery, installation, dismantle and return delivery are lease related because the payments are considered minimum lease payments that are an integral part of the negotiated lease agreement with the customer. These revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain leases are accounted for as sales-type leases. For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment. Other revenues include interest income on sales-type leases and rental income on facility leases. Non-Lease Revenues Non-lease revenues are recognized in the period when control of the performance obligation is transferred, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services. For liquid and solid containment solutions, portable storage containers and electronic test equipment, rental related services revenues for delivery and return delivery are considered non-lease revenues. Sales revenues are typically recognized at a point in time, which occurs upon the completion of delivery, installation and acceptance of the equipment by the customer. Accounting for non-lease revenues requires judgment in determining the point in time the customer gains control of the equipment and the appropriate accounting period to recognize revenue. Sales taxes charged to customers are reported on a net basis and are excluded from revenues and expenses. -72- The following table disaggregates the Company’s revenues by lease (within the scope of Topic 840) and non-lease revenues (within the scope of Topic 606) and the underlying service provided for the three years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017: (in thousands) Mobile Modular TRS- RenTelco Adler Tanks Enviroplex Consolidated Year Ended December 31, 2019 Leasing $ 234,032 $ 108,044 $ 68,917 $ — $ 410,993 Non-lease: Rental related services 18,964 2,599 27,634 — 49,197 Sales 47,045 18,995 1,266 39,814 107,120 Other 969 1,845 106 — 2,920 Total non-lease 66,978 23,439 29,006 39,814 159,237 Total revenues $ 301,010 $ 131,483 $ 97,923 $ 39,814 $ 570,230 2018 Leasing $ 200,214 $ 94,345 $ 70,653 $ — $ 365,212 Non-lease: Rental related services 14,870 2,607 24,276 — 41,753 Sales 39,467 19,895 1,044 29,046 89,452 Other 23 1,810 80 — 1,913 Total non-lease 54,360 24,312 25,400 29,046 133,118 Total revenues $ 254,574 $ 118,657 $ 96,053 $ 29,046 $ 498,330 2017 Leasing $ 180,612 $ 85,930 $ 64,676 $ — $ 331,218 Non-lease: Rental related services 13,331 2,358 24,322 — 40,011 Sales 37,434 18,137 2,362 31,369 89,302 Other ( 111 ) 1,619 ( 5 ) — 1,503 Total non-lease 50,654 22,114 26,679 31,369 130,816 Total revenues $ 231,266 $ 108,044 $ 91,355 $ 31,369 $ 462,034 Customer returns of rental equipment prior to the end of the rental contract term are typically billed a cancellation fee, which is recorded as rental revenue in the period billed. Sales of new relocatable modular buildings, portable storage containers, electronic test equipment and related accessories and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes not manufactured by the Company are typically covered by warranties provided by the manufacturer of the products sold. The Company typically provides limited 90 -day warranties for certain sales of used rental equipment and one-year warranties on equipment manufactured by Enviroplex. Although the Company’s policy is to provide reserves for warranties when required for specific circumstances, the Company has not found it necessary to establish such reserves to date as warranty costs have not been significant. The Company’s incremental cost of obtaining lease contracts, which consists of salesperson commissions, are deferred and amortized over the initial lease term for modular building leases. Incremental costs for obtaining a contract for all other operating segments are expensed in the period incurred because the lease term is typically less than 12 months. -73- NOTE 5. NOTES PAYABLE Notes payable consists of the following: (in thousands) December 31, 2019 2018 Unsecured revolving lines of credit $ 193,459 $ 198,603 3.68% Series B senior notes due in 2021 40,000 40,000 3.84% Series C senior notes due in 2022 60,000 60,000 293,459 298,603 Unamortized debt issuance cost ( 28 ) ( 39 ) $ 293,431 $ 298,564 As of December 31, 2019, the future minimum payments under the unsecured revolving lines of credit, 3.68 % Series B senior notes due in 2021 and 3.84 % Series C senior notes due in 2022 are as follows: (in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2020 $ — 2021 233,459 2022 60,000 $ 293,459 Unsecured Revolving Lines of Credit In March 2016, the Company renewed its credit agreement with a syndicate of banks (the “Credit Facility”). The five-year facility matures on March 31, 2021 and replaced the Company’s prior $ 420.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility. The Credit Facility provides for a $ 420.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (which may be increased to $ 620.0 million with $ 200.0 million of additional commitments), which includes a $ 25.0 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a $ 10.0 million sublimit for swing-line loans. In March 2016, the Company entered into a Credit Facility Letter Agreement and a Credit Line Note in favor of MUFG Union Bank, N.A., extending its line of credit facility related to its cash management services (“Sweep Service Facility”) and increasing the facility size from $ 10.0 million to $ 12.0 million. The Sweep Service Facility matures on the earlier of March 31, 2021, or the date the Company ceases to utilize MUFG Union Bank, N.A. for its cash management services. At December 31, 2019, under the Credit Facility and Sweep Service Facility, the Company had unsecured lines of credit that permit it to borrow up to $ 432.0 million of which $ 193.5 million was outstanding, and had capacity to borrow up to an additional $ 238.5 million. The Amended Credit Facility contains financial covenants requiring the Company to not (all defined terms used below not otherwise defined herein have the meaning assigned to such terms in the Amended Credit Facility): • Permit the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges as of the end of any fiscal quarter to be less than 2.50 to 1. At December 31, 2019, the actual ratio was 4.27 to 1. • Permit the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of funded debt to EBITDA at any time during any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters to be greater than 2.75 to 1. At December 31, 2019, the actual ratio was 1.24 to 1. • Permit Tangible Net Worth as of the end of any fiscal quarter of the Company to be less than the sum of (i) $ 246.1 million plus (ii) 25 % of the Company’s Consolidated Net Income (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility) (but only if a positive number) for each fiscal quarter ended subsequent to December 31, 2011 plus (iii) 90 % of the net cash proceeds from the issuance of the Company’s capital stock after December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2019, such sum was $ 388.1 million and the actual Tangible Net Worth of the Company was $ 598.5 million. -74- unused fees. Amounts borrowed under the Sweep Service Facility are based upon the MUFG Union Bank, N.A. base rate plus an applicable margin and an unused commitment fee for the portion of the $ 12.0 million facility not used. The applicable base rate margin and unused commitment fee rates for the Sweep Service Facility are the same as for the Amended Credit Facility.

Among other provisions, the Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 % to 21 % in 2018, required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and created new taxes on certain foreign-source earnings. As of December 31, 2019, the Company completed its accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the Tax Act without any material adjustments to its previous estimates. As of December 31, 2019 the Company did no t have a deferred tax liability related to its foreign earnings because it did not have any specific plans to repatriate funds from its international subsidiaries. The Company may do so in the future if a dividend can be remitted with no material tax impact. -76- In December 2016, the Company decided to exit the Bangalore, India branch operations of its TRS-RenTelco electronics division. The wind down of operations in India began in 2017. As a result, a valuation allowance was recorded against the deferred tax assets that resulted primarily from accumulated net operating loss carry forwards in India that management estimated the benefit of which will not be realized. As of December 31, 2019, the Company’s foreign net operating losses for tax purposes were $ 0.6 million. If not realized, these carry forwards will begin to expire in 2023 . For income tax purposes, deductible compensation related to share-based awards is based on the value of the award when realized, which may be different than the compensation expense recognized by the company for financial statement purposes which is based on the award value on the date of grant. The difference between the value of the award upon grant, and the value of the award when ultimately realized, creates either additional tax expense or benefit. In 2019, 2018 and 2017 exercise of share-based awards by employees resulted in an excess tax benefit of $ 2.1 million, $ 2.0 million and $ 0.9 million, respectively. The Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. The Company evaluated all of its tax positions for which the statute of limitations remained open and determined there were no material unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. In addition, there have been no material changes in unrecognized benefits during 2019, 2018 and 2017. The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various states and foreign jurisdictions. Tax regulations within each jurisdiction are subject to interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and require the application of significant judgment. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for the years before 2015. Our income tax returns are subject to examination by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. There may be differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations, and as a result, disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of income. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision (benefit) for income taxes in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income for all periods presented. Such interest and penalties were not significant for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. NOTE 7. BENEFIT PLANS Stock Plans The Company adopted the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2016 Plan”), effective June 8, 2016, under which 2,000,000 shares of the common stock of the Company, plus the number of shares that remain available for grants of awards under the Company's 2007 Stock Option Plan (the “2007 Plan”) and become available as a result of forfeiture, termination, or expiration of awards previously granted under the 2007 Plan, were reserved for the grant of equity awards to its employees, directors and consultants. The equity awards have a maximum term of 7 years at an exercise price of not less than 100 % of the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date the equity award is granted. The 2016 Plan replaced the 2007 Plan. The 2016 Plan provides for the grant of awards in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units (“RSUs”), the vesting of which may be performance-based or service-based, and other rights and benefits. Each RSU issued reduces the number of shares of the Company’s common stock available for grant under the 2016 Plan by two shares. There were no modifications to the 2016 Plan and no awards classified as liabilities in the year ended December 31, 2019. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, the share-based compensation expense was $ 5.9 million, $ 4.1 million and $ 3.2 million, respectively, before provision for income taxes. The Company recorded a tax benefit of approximately $ 1.6 million, $ 1.1 million and $ 1.3 million, respectively, related to the aforementioned share-based compensation expenses. There was no capitalized share-based compensation expense in the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017. Stock Options As of December 31, 2019, a cumulative total of 8,458,600 shares subject to options have been granted with exercise prices ranging from $ 3.47 to $ 40.37 . Of these, options have been exercised for the purchase of 6,214,548 shares, while options for 1,663,912 shares have been terminated, and options for 580,140 shares with exercise prices ranging from $ 24.60 to $ 40.37 remained outstanding under the stock plans. These options vest over five years and expire seven years after grant. To date, no options have been issued to -77- any of the Company’s non-employee advisors. As of December 31, 201 9 , 1,708,914 shares remained available for issuance of awards under the stock plans. A summary of the Company’s option activity and related information for the three years ended December 31, 2019 is as follows: Number of options Weighted- average price Weighted- average remaining contractual term (in years) Aggregate intrinsic value (in millions) Balance at December 31, 2016 1,584,435 $ 28.14 Options granted 299,600 34.66 Options exercised ( 398,275 ) 28.94 Options cancelled/forfeited/expired ( 276,900 ) 28.04 Balance at December 31, 2017 1,208,860 28.14 Options granted — — Options exercised ( 332,810 ) 29.49 Options cancelled/forfeited/expired ( 30,450 ) 28.27 Balance at December 31, 2018 845,600 28.14 Options granted — — Options exercised ( 260,860 ) 29.55 Options cancelled/forfeited/expired ( 4,600 ) 30.59 Balance at December 31, 2019 580,140 $ 29.57 3.31 $ 27.2 Exercisable at December 31, 2019 289,350 $ 29.35 3.00 $ 13.6 Expected to vest after December 31, 2019 289,003 $ 29.80 3.61 $ 13.5 The intrinsic value of stock options at any point in time is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying awards and the quoted price of the Company’s common stock. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised and sold under the Company’s stock option plans was $ 9.1 million, $ 9.0 million and $ 5.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, determined as of the date of option exercise. As of December 31, 2019, there was approximately $ 1.4 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation option arrangements granted under the Company’s stock plans, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.1 years. The following table indicates the options outstanding and options exercisable by exercise price with the weighted-average remaining contractual life for the options outstanding and the weighted-average exercise price at December 31, 2019: Options Outstanding Options Exercisable Exercise price Number outstanding at December 31, 2019 Weighted-average remaining contractual life (Years) Weighted-average grant date value Number exercisable at December 31, 2019 Weighted-average grant date value $20 – 25 256,640 3.17 $ 24.60 128,440 $ 24.60 $25 – 30 6,150 3.13 $ 25.13 1,120 $ 25.14 $30 – 35 306,810 3.40 $ 33.48 155,710 $ 33.04 $35 – 40 6,800 4.00 $ 39.19 4,080 $ 39.19 $40 – 45 3,740 4.67 $ 40.37 — $ — $20 – 45 580,140 3.31 $ 29.57 289,350 $ 29.35 The Company utilizes the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of share-based compensation at the date of grant, which requires the use of accounting judgment and financial estimates, including estimates of the expected term option holders will retain their vested stock options before exercising them, the estimated volatility of the Company’s stock price over the expected term and the expected number of options that will be forfeited prior to the completion of their vesting requirements. Application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different estimates of the fair value of share-based compensation amounts recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. -78- The fair value of each option granted was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model using the following weighted-average assumptions: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Expected term (in years) — — 5.0 Expected volatility — — 26.1 % Expected dividend yields — — 3.0 % Risk-free interest rates — — 2.0 % The Company monitors option exercise behavior to determine the appropriate homogenous groups for estimation purposes. The Company’s option activity is separated into two categories: directors and employees. The expected term of the options represents the estimated period of time until exercise and is based on historical experience, giving consideration to the option terms, vesting schedules and expectations of future behavior. Expected stock volatility was based on historical stock price volatility of the Company and the risk-free interest rates were based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect on the date of the option grant for the estimated period the options will be outstanding. The expected dividend yield was based upon the current dividend annualized as a percentage of the grant exercise price. No options were granted in 2019 and 2018. The weighted average grant date fair value per share was $ 6.28 during the year ended December 31, 2017. Restricted Stock Units The following table summarizes the activity of the Company’s RSUs, which includes service-based and performance-based awards, for the three years ended December 31, 2019: Weighted- Aggregate average intrinsic Number grant date value of shares fair value (in millions) Balance at December 31, 2016 125,240 30.66 RSUs granted 70,960 34.53 RSUs vested ( 36,336 ) 26.99 RSUs cancelled/forfeited/expired ( 66,200 ) 32.63 Balance at December 31, 2017 93,664 33.62 RSUs granted 97,260 49.47 RSUs vested ( 30,214 ) 33.16 RSUs cancelled/forfeited/expired ( 21,200 ) 33.88 Balance at December 31, 2018 139,510 44.73 RSUs granted 83,440 59.98 RSUs vested ( 25,862 ) 48.31 RSUs cancelled/forfeited/expired ( 840 ) 59.84 Balance at December 31, 2019 196,248 $ 50.68 $ 15.0 Performance-based RSUs issued prior to 2018 vest over five years , with 60 % of the shares immediately vesting after three years when the performance criteria has been determined to have been met and 20 % of the remaining shares vesting annually at the anniversary of the performance determination date, subject to continuous employment of the participant. The 2018 and 2019 performance-based RSU grants vest after three years with 100 % of the shares vesting immediately when performance criteria has been determined to have been met. There were 200,839 performance-based RSUs expected to vest as of December 31, 2019. Service-based RSUs issued to the Company’s directors generally vest over twelve to fourteen months . Service–based RSUs issued to the Company’s management vest over three years. There were 81,984 service-based RSUs expected to vest as of December 31, 2019. No forfeitures are currently expected. The total fair value of RSUs that vested during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 based on the weighted average grant date values was $ 1.2 million, $ 1.0 million and $ 1.0 million, respectively. Share-based compensation expense for RSUs for the year ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $ 4.7 million, $ 2.6 million and $ 1.4 , respectively. As of December 31, 2019, the total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSUs was $ 6.9 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.1 years. -79- Employee Stock Ownership and 401(k) Plans The McGrath RentCorp Employee Stock Ownership and 401(k) Plan (the “KSOP”) provides that each participant may annually contribute an elected percentage of his or her salary, not to exceed the statutory limit. Each employee who has at least three months of service with the Company and is 21 years or older, is eligible to participate in the KSOP. The Company, at its discretion, may make matching contributions. Contributions are expensed in the year approved by the Board of Directors. Dividends on the Company’s stock held by the KSOP are treated as ordinary dividends and, in accordance with existing tax laws, are deducted by the Company in the year paid. For the year ended December 31, 2019 dividends deducted by the Company were $ 0.4 million, which resulted in a tax benefit of approximately $ 0.1 million in 2019. At December 31, 2019, the KSOP held 241,956 shares, or 1 % of the Company’s total common shares outstanding. These shares are included in basic and diluted earnings per share calculations. NOTE 8. SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY The Company has in the past made purchases of shares of its common stock from time to time in over-the-counter market (NASDAQ) transactions, through privately negotiated, large block transactions and through a share repurchase plan, in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In August 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase 2,000,000 shares of the Company's outstanding common stock. The amount and time of the specific repurchases are subject to prevailing market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors, including management’s discretion. All shares repurchased by the Company are canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares of common stock. There can be no assurance that any authorized shares will be repurchased and the repurchase program may be modified, extended or terminated by the board of directors at any time. There were no repurchases of common stock during the twelve months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. As of December 31, 2019, 1,592,026 shares remain authorized for repurchase under this authorization. NOTE 9. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company leases certain facilities under various operating leases. Most of the lease agreements provide the Company with the option of renewing its lease at the end of the lease term, at the fair rental value. In most cases, management expects that in the normal course of business, facility leases will be renewed or replaced by other leases. Minimum payments under these leases, exclusive of property taxes and insurance, are as follows: (in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2020 $ 2,732 2021 2,370 2022 1,805 2023 1,290 2024 1,005 Thereafter 293 $ 9,495 Facility rent expense was $ 3.9 million in 2019 and $ 3.5 million in 2018 and 2017. The Company is involved in various lawsuits and routine claims arising out of the normal course of its business. The Company maintains insurance coverage for its operations and employees with appropriate aggregate, per occurrence and deductible limits as the Company reasonably determines necessary or prudent with current operations and historical experience. The major policies include coverage for property, general liability, auto, directors and officers, health, and workers’ compensation insurances. The Company records a provision for a liability when it believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. The Company reviews these provisions at least quarterly and adjusts these provisions to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Litigation is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Company’s control. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility that the ultimate amount of liability not covered by insurance, if any, under any pending litigation and claims, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the financial position or operating results of the Company. -80- The Company’s health plans is self-funded high deductible plans with annual stop-loss insurance of $ 200,000 per claim. Beginning in 2019, the Company’s workers compensation insurance is underwritten by an insurance company with no stop-loss value and $ 350,000 for prior claim years. Insurance providers are responsible for making claim payments that exceed these amounts on an individual claim basis. In addition, the Company has stop loss insurance that pays for claim payments made during a twelve month coverage period that exceeds certain specified thresholds in the aggregate. The Company records an expense when health and workers compensation claim payments are made and accrues for the portion of claims incurred, but not yet paid at period end. The Company makes these accruals based upon a combination of historical claim payments, loss development experience and actuarial estimates. A high degree of judgment is required in developing the underlying assumptions and the resulting amounts to be accrued. In addition, our assumptions will change as the Company’s loss experience develops. All of these factors have the potential for impacting the amounts previously accrued and the Company may be required to increase or decrease the amounts previously accrued. At December 31, 2019 and 2018, accruals for the Company’s health and workers’ compensation high deductible plans were $ 2.8 million and $ 3.0 million, respectively. NOTE 10. INTANGIBLE ASSETS Intangible assets consist of the following: (dollar amounts in thousands) Estimated useful life in years December 31, 2019 December 31, 2018 Trade name Indefinite $ 5,871 $ 5,871 Customer relationships 11 10,644 9,849 Non-compete agreements 5 157 — 16,672 15,720 Less accumulated amortization ( 9,338 ) ( 8,466 ) $ 7,334 $ 7,254 Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their respective useful lives. Amortization expense in each of the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was $ 0.9 million. Based on the carrying values at December 31, 2019 and assuming no subsequent impairment of the underlying assets, the annual amortization is expected to be $ 0.2 million in 2020 and $ 0.2 million in 2021 through 2026. NOTE 11. ACQUISITION On August 15, 2019, the Company completed the purchase of the container rental business of ATP Containers LLC, dba TuffBox Container (“TuffBox”) for $ 7.8 million. The Company accounted for this transaction as a business combination and the initial assessment of the fair value of the purchased assets was allocated primarily to rental equipment totaling $ 5.5 million and intangible assets totaling $ 1.3 million, which included $ 0.4 million allocated to goodwill. The goodwill represents the future economic benefits to be derived from the geographic market expansion of the Company’s portable storage division. The goodwill was recorded in the Mobile Modular segment and is fully deductible for income tax purposes. The TuffBox operating results are included in the Mobile Modular segment results since the date of acquisition. Supplemental pro forma prior year information has not been provided as the historical financial results of TuffBox were not significant. Incremental transaction costs associated with the acquisition were not significant. NOTE 12. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS There were no related party transactions in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, or amounts owed to related parties at such dates. -81- NOTE 13. SEGMENT REPORTING FASB guidelines establish annual and interim reporting standards for an enterprise’s operating segments and related disclosures about its products, services, geographic areas and major customers. In accordance with these guidelines the Company’s four reportable segments are Mobile Modular, TRS-RenTelco, Adler Tanks and Enviroplex. Management focuses on several key measures to evaluate and assess each segment’s performance including rental revenue growth, gross margin, and income before provision for income taxes. Excluding interest expense, allocations of revenue and expense not directly associated with one of these segments are generally allocated to Mobile Modular, TRS-RenTelco and Adler Tanks, based on their pro-rata share of direct revenues.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE. None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Company’s management under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in rules promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) for the Company. Based on their evaluation the CEO and CFO have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2019. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. During the last quarter of the Company’s fiscal year ended December 31, 2019, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and the CEO and CFO have concluded that these controls and procedures are effective at the “reasonable assurance” level. Management’s Assessment of Internal Control. Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019, is discussed in the Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting included on page 55. The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 has been audited by Grant Thornton LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, and its report is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

PART I ITEM 1. BUSINESS. General Overview McGrath RentCorp (the “Company”) is a California corporation organized in 1979 with corporate offices located in Livermore, California. The Company’s common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Select Market under the symbol “MGRC”. References in this report to the “Company”, “we”, “us”, and “ours” refer to McGrath RentCorp and its subsidiaries, unless the context requires otherwise. The Company is a diversified business-to-business rental company with four rental divisions: relocatable modular buildings, portable storage containers, electronic test equipment, and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes. Although the Company’s primary emphasis is on equipment rentals, sales of equipment occur in the normal course of business. The Company is comprised of four reportable business segments: (1) its modular building and portable storage segment (“Mobile Modular”); (2) its electronic test equipment segment (“TRS-RenTelco”); (3) its containment solutions for the storage of hazardous and non-hazardous liquids and solids segment (“Adler Tanks”); and (4) its classroom manufacturing business selling modular buildings used primarily as classrooms in California (“Enviroplex”). The Mobile Modular business segment includes the Mobile Modular Portable Storage division, which represented approximately 8% of the Company’s 2018 total revenues. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues during 2018, 2017 and 2016. Revenue from foreign country customers accounted for 4% of the Company’s revenues in 2018 and 2017, and 5% in 2016. Business Model The Company invests capital in rental products and generally has recovered its original investment through rents less cash operating expenses in a relatively short period of time compared to the product’s rental life. When the Company’s rental products are sold, the proceeds generally have covered a high percentage of the original investment. With these characteristics, a significant base of rental assets on rent generates a considerable amount of operating cash flows to support continued rental asset growth. The Company’s rental products have the following characteristics: • The product required by the customer tends to be expensive compared to the Company’s monthly rental charge, with the interim rental solution typically evaluated as a less costly alternative. • Generally, we believe the Company’s customers have a short-term need for our rental products. The customer’s rental requirement may be driven by a number of factors including time, budget or capital constraints, future uncertainty impacting their ongoing requirements, equipment availability, specific project requirements, peak periods of demand or the customer may want to eliminate the burdens and risks of ownership. -2- • All of the Company’s rental products have long useful lives relative to the typical r ental term. Modular buildings (“modulars”) have an estimated life of eighteen years compared to the typical rental term of twelve to twenty-four months, electronic test equipment has an estimated life range of one to eight years (depending on the type of product) compared to a typical rental term of one to six months, and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes have an estimated life of twenty years compared to typical rental terms of one to six months. • We believe short-term rental rates typically recover the Company’s original investment quickly based on the respective product’s annual yield, or annual rental revenues divided by the average cost of rental equipment. For modulars the original investment is recovered in approximately five years, in approximately three years for electronic test equipment and in approximately four years for liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes. • When a product is sold from our rental inventory, a significant portion of the original investment is usually recovered. Effective asset management is a critical element to each of the rental businesses and the residuals realized when product is sold from inventory. Modular asset management requires designing and building the product for a long life, coupled with ongoing repair and maintenance investments, to ensure its long useful rental life and generally higher residuals upon sale. Electronic test equipment asset management requires understanding, selecting and investing in equipment technologies that support market demand and, once invested, proactively managing the equipment at the model level for optimum utilization through its technology life cycle to maximize the rental revenues and residuals realized. Liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes asset management requires selecting and purchasing quality product and making ongoing repair and maintenance investments to ensure its long rental life. The Company believes that rental revenue growth from an increasing base of rental assets and improved gross profits on rents are the best measures of the health of each of our rental businesses. Additionally, we believe our business model and results are enhanced by operational leverage that is created from large regional sales and inventory centers for modulars, a single U.S. based sales, inventory and operations facility for electronic test equipment, as well as shared senior management and back office functions for financing, human resources, insurance, and operating and accounting systems. Employees As of December 31, 2018, the Company had 1,066 employees, of whom 87 were primarily administrative and executive personnel, with 577, 199, 127 and 76 in the operations of Mobile Modular, Adler Tanks, TRS-RenTelco and Enviroplex, respectively. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and management believes its relationship with our employees is good.

Modulars vary from simple single-unit construction site offices to multi-floor modular complexes. The Company’s modular rental fleet includes a full range of styles and sizes. The Company considers its modulars to be among the most attractive and well-designed available. The units are constructed with wood or metal siding, sturdily built and physically capable of a long useful life. Modulars are generally provided with installed heat, air conditioning, lighting, electrical outlets and floor covering, and may have customized interiors including partitioning, cabinetry and plumbing facilities. Mobile Modular purchases new modulars from various manufacturers who build to Mobile Modular’s design specifications. During 2018, Mobile Modular purchased 33% of its modular units from one manufacturer. The Company believes that the loss of any of its primary modular manufacturers could have an adverse effect on its operations since Mobile Modular could experience higher prices and longer lead times for delivery of modular units until other manufacturers were able to increase their production capacity. The Company’s modulars are manufactured to comply with state building codes, have a low risk of obsolescence, and can be modified or reconfigured to accommodate a wide variety of customer needs. Historically, as state building codes have changed over the years, Mobile Modular has been able to continue to use existing modulars, with minimal, if any, required upgrades. The Company has no assurance that it will continue to be able to use existing modular equipment with minimal upgrades as building codes change in the future. Mobile Modular currently operates from regional sales and inventory centers in California, Texas, Florida and Georgia, serving large geographic areas in these states, and sales offices serving North Carolina, Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C. The California, Texas, Florida and Georgia regional sales and inventory centers have in-house infrastructure and operational capabilities to support quick and efficient repair, modification, and refurbishment of equipment for the next rental opportunity. The Company believes operating from large regional sales and inventory centers results in better operating margins as operating costs can be spread over a large installed customer base. Mobile Modular actively maintains and repairs its rental equipment, and management believes this ensures the continued use of the modular product over its long life and, when sold, has resulted in higher sale proceeds relative to its capitalized cost. When rental equipment returns from a customer, the necessary repairs and preventative maintenance are performed prior to its next rental. By making these expenditures for repair and maintenance throughout the equipment’s life we believe that older equipment can generally rent for rates similar to those of newer equipment. Management believes the condition of the equipment is a more significant factor in determining the rental rate and sale price than its age. Over the last three years, used equipment sold each year represented less than 2% of rental equipment, and has been, on average, 14 years old with sale proceeds above its net book value. Competitive Strengths Market Leadership – The Company believes Mobile Modular is the largest supplier in California, and a significant supplier in Florida and Texas, of modular educational facilities for rental to both public and private schools. Management is knowledgeable about the needs of its educational customers and the related regulatory requirements in the states where Mobile Modular operates, which enables Mobile Modular to meet its customers’ specific project requirements. Expertise – The Company believes that over the more than 35 years during which Mobile Modular has competed in the modular rental industry, it has developed expertise that differentiates it from its competitors. Mobile Modular has dedicated its attention to continuously developing and improving the quality of its modular units. Mobile Modular has expertise in the licensing and regulatory requirements that govern modulars in the states where it operates, and its management, sales and operational staffs are knowledgeable and committed to providing exemplary customer service. Mobile Modular has expertise in project management and complex applications. Operating Structure – Part of the Company’s strategy for Mobile Modular is to create facilities and infrastructure capabilities that its competitors cannot easily duplicate. Mobile Modular achieves this by building regional sales and inventory centers designed to serve a broad geographic area and a large installed customer base under a single overhead structure, thereby reducing its cost per transaction. The Company’s regional facilities and related infrastructure enable Mobile Modular to maximize its modular inventory utilization through efficient and cost effective in-house repair, maintenance and refurbishment for quick redeployment of equipment to meet its customers’ needs. -4- Ass et Management – The Company believes Mobile Modular markets high quality, well-constructed and attractive modulars. Mobile Modular requires manufacturers to build to its specifications, which enables Mobile Modular to maintain a standardized quality fleet. In addition, through its ongoing repair, refurbishment and maintenance programs, the Company believes Mobile Modular’s buildings are the best maintained in the industry. The Company depreciates its modular buildings over an 18 year estimated useful life to a 50% residual value. Older buildings continue to be productive primarily because of Mobile Modular’s focus on ongoing fleet maintenance. Also, as a result of Mobile Modular’s maintenance programs, when a modular unit is sold, a high percentage of the equipment’s capitalized cost is recovered. In addition, the fleet’s utilization is regionally optimized by managing inventory through estimates of market demand, fulfillment of current rental and sale order activity, modular returns and capital purchases. Customer Service - The Company believes the modular rental industry to be service intensive and locally based. The Company strives to provide excellent service by meeting its commitments to its customers, being proactive in resolving project issues and seeking to continuously improve the customers’ experience. Mobile Modular is committed to offering quick response to requests for information, providing experienced assistance, on time delivery and preventative maintenance of its units. Mobile Modular’s goal is to continuously improve its procedures, processes and computer systems to enhance internal operational efficiency. The Company believes this dedication to customer service results in high levels of customer loyalty and repeat business. Market Management estimates relocatable modular building rental is an industry that today has equipment on rent or available for rent in the U.S. with an aggregate original cost of over $5.0 billion. Mobile Modular’s largest market segment is for temporary classroom and other educational space needs of public and private schools, colleges and universities in California and Florida, and to a lesser extent in Texas, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C. Management believes the demand for rental classrooms is caused by shifting and fluctuating school populations, the limited state funds for new construction, the need for temporary classroom space during reconstruction of older schools, class size reduction and the phasing out of portable classrooms compliant with older building codes (see “Classroom Rentals and Sales to Public Schools (K-12)” below). Other customer applications include sales offices, construction field offices, health care facilities, church sanctuaries and child care facilities. Industrial, manufacturing, entertainment and utility companies, as well as governmental agencies commonly use large multi-modular complexes to serve their interim administrative and operational space needs. Modulars offer customers quick, cost-effective space solutions while conserving their capital. The Company’s corporate offices, and California, Texas, Florida and Georgia regional sales and inventory center offices are housed in various sizes of modular units. Since most of Mobile Modular’s customer requirements are to fill temporary space needs, Mobile Modular’s marketing emphasis is on rentals rather than sales. Mobile Modular attracts customers through its website at www.mobilemodular.com, internet advertising and direct marketing. Customers are encouraged to visit a regional sales and inventory center to view different models on display and to see a regional office, which is a working example of a modular application. Because service is a major competitive factor in the rental of modulars, Mobile Modular offers quick response to requests for information, assistance in the choice of a suitable size and floor plan, in-house customization services, rapid delivery, timely installation and field service of its units. On Mobile Modular’s website, customers are able to view and select inventory for quotation and request in-field service. Rentals Rental periods range from one month to several years with a typical initial contract term between twelve and twenty-four months. In general, monthly rental rates are determined by a number of factors including length of term, market demand, product availability and product type. Upon expiration of the initial term, or any extensions, rental rates are reviewed, and when appropriate, are adjusted based on current market conditions. Most rental agreements are operating leases that provide no purchase options, and when a rental agreement does provide the customer with a purchase option, it is generally on terms management believes to be attractive to Mobile Modular. The customer is responsible for obtaining the necessary use permits and for the costs of insuring the unit, and is financially responsible for transporting the unit to the site, preparation of the site, installation of the unit, dismantle and return delivery of the unit to Mobile Modular, and certain costs for customization. Mobile Modular maintains the units in good working condition while on rent. Upon return, the units are inspected for damage and customers are billed for items considered beyond normal wear and tear. Generally, the units are then repaired for subsequent use. Repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred and can include floor repairs, roof maintenance, cleaning, painting and other cosmetic repairs. The costs of major refurbishment of equipment are capitalized to the extent the refurbishment significantly improves the quality and adds value or life to the equipment. -5- At December 31, 201 8 , Mobile Modular owned 53,035 new or previously rented modulars and portable storage containers with an aggregate cost of $ 817,375 million including accessories, or an average cost per unit of $ 15,411 . Utilization is calculated at the end of each month by dividing the cost of rental equipment on rent by the total cost of rental equipment, excluding new equipment inventory and accessory equipment. At December 31, 201 8 , fleet utilization was 79.3 % and average fleet utilization during 201 8 was 78.2 %. The Mobile Modular segment includes the results of operations of Mobile Modular Portable Storage, which represented approximately 8 % of the Company’s 201 8 total revenues. Sales In addition to operating its rental fleet, Mobile Modular sells modulars to customers. These sales typically arise out of its marketing efforts for the rental fleet and from existing equipment already on rent. Such sales can be of either new or used units from the rental fleet, which permits some turnover of older units. During 2018 Mobile Modular’s largest sale represented approximately 5% of Mobile Modular’s sales, 2% of the Company’s consolidated sales and less than 1% of the Company’s consolidated revenues. Mobile Modular typically provides limited 90-day warranties on used modulars and passes through the manufacturers’ one-year warranty on new units to its customers. Warranty costs have not been significant to Mobile Modular’s operations to date, and the Company attributes this to its commitment to high quality standards and regular maintenance programs. However, there can be no assurance that warranty costs will continue to be insignificant to Mobile Modular’s operations in the future. Enviroplex manufactures portable classrooms built to the requirements of the California Division of the State Architect (“DSA”) and sells directly to California public school districts and other educational institutions. Seasonality Typically, during each calendar year, our highest numbers of classrooms are shipped for rental and sale orders during the second and third quarters for delivery and installation prior to the start of the upcoming school year. The majority of classrooms shipped in the second and third quarters have rental start dates during the third quarter, thereby making the fourth quarter the first full quarter of rental revenues recognized for these transactions. Competition Competition in the rental and sale of relocatable modular buildings is intense. Some of our larger national competitors in the modular building leasing industry, notably WillScot Corporation, have a greater range of products and services, greater financial and marketing resources, larger customer bases, and greater name recognition than we have. In addition, a number of other smaller companies operate regionally throughout the country. Mobile Modular operates primarily in California, Texas, Florida, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, Maryland and Washington, D.C. Significant competitive factors in the rental business include availability, price, service, reliability, appearance and functionality of the product. Mobile Modular markets high quality, well-constructed and attractive modulars. Part of the Company’s strategy for modulars is to create facilities and infrastructure capabilities that its competitors cannot easily duplicate. The Company's facilities and related infrastructure enable it to modify modulars efficiently and cost effectively to meet its customers’ needs. Management's goal is to be more responsive at less expense. Management believes this strategy, together with its emphasis on prompt and efficient customer service, gives Mobile Modular a competitive advantage. Mobile Modular is determined to respond quickly to requests for information, and provide experienced assistance for the first-time user, rapid delivery and timely repair of its modular units. Mobile Modular’s already high level of efficiency and responsiveness continues to improve as the Company upgrades procedures, processes and computer systems that control its internal operations. The Company anticipates intense competition to continue and believes it must continue to improve its products and services to remain competitive in the market for modulars. Classroom Rentals and Sales to Public Schools (K-12) Mobile Modular and Enviroplex provide classroom and specialty space needs serving public and private schools, colleges and universities. Within the educational market, the rental (by Mobile Modular) and sale (by Enviroplex and Mobile Modular) of modulars to public school districts for use as portable classrooms, restroom buildings and administrative offices for kindergarten through grade twelve (K-12) are a significant portion of the Company’s revenues. Mobile Modular rents and sells classrooms in California, Florida, Texas, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C. Enviroplex sells classrooms in the California market. California is Mobile Modular’s largest educational market. Historically, demand in this market has been fueled by shifting and fluctuating student populations, insufficient funding for new school construction, class size reduction programs, modernization of aging school facilities and the phasing out of portable classrooms no longer compliant with current building codes. The following table shows the approximate percentages of the Company’s modular rental and sales revenues, and of its consolidated rental and sales revenues for the past five years, that rentals and sales to these schools constitute: -6- Rentals and Sales to Public Schools (K-12) as a Percentage of Total Rental and Sales Revenues Percentage of: 2018 2017 2016 2015 2014 Modular Rental Revenues (Mobile Modular) 33% 33% 34% 33% 32% Modular Sales Revenues (Mobile Modular & Enviroplex) 70% 76% 67% 43% 49% Modular Rental and Sales Revenues (Mobile Modular & Enviroplex) 44% 47% 43% 35% 37% Consolidated Rental and Sales Revenues 1 24% 26% 23% 16% 16% 1 Consolidated Rental and Sales Revenue percentage is calculated by dividing Modular rental and sales revenues to public schools (K-12) by the Company’s consolidated rental and sales revenues. School Facility Funding Funding for public school facilities is derived from a variety of sources including the passage of both statewide and local facility bond measures, operating budgets, developer fees, various taxes including parcel and sales taxes levied to support school operating budgets, and lottery funds. There is no certainty on the timing of the bond sales and it could take additional years before projects funded by these bonds generate meaningful demand for relocatable classrooms. -7- ELECTRONIC TEST EQUIPMENT Description TRS-RenTelco rents and sells electronic test equipment nationally and internationally from two facilities located in Grapevine, Texas (the “Dallas facility”) and Dollard-des-Ormeaux, Canada (the “Montreal facility”). TRS-RenTelco’s revenues are derived from the rental and sale of general purpose and communications test equipment to a broad range of companies, from Fortune 500 to middle and smaller market companies, in the aerospace, defense, communications, manufacturing and semiconductor industries. Electronic test equipment revenues are primarily affected by the business activity within these industries related to research and development, manufacturing, and communication infrastructure installation and maintenance. The Dallas facility, TRS-RenTelco’s primary operating location, houses the electronic test equipment inventory, sales engineers, calibration laboratories, and operations staff for U.S. and international business. The Montreal facility houses sales engineers and operations staff to serve the Canadian market. As of December 31, 2018, the original cost of electronic test equipment inventory was comprised of 75% general purpose electronic test equipment and 25% communications electronic test equipment. Engineers, technicians and scientists utilize general purpose electronic test equipment in developing products, controlling manufacturing processes, completing field service applications and evaluating the performance of their own electrical and electronic equipment. These instruments are rented primarily to aerospace, defense, electronics, industrial, research and semiconductor industries. To date, Keysight Technologies (formerly Agilent Technologies) and Tektronix, a division of Fortive Corporation, have manufactured the majority of TRS-RenTelco’s general purpose electronic test equipment with the remainder acquired from over 60 other manufacturers. Communications test equipment, including fiber optic test equipment, is utilized by technicians, engineers and installation contractors to evaluate voice, data and multimedia communications networks, to install fiber optic cabling, and in the development and manufacturing of transmission, network and wireless products. These instruments are rented primarily to manufacturers of communications equipment and products, electrical and communications installation contractors, field technicians, and service providers. To date, Anritsu and Viavi Solutions (formerly JDS Uniphase Corporation) have manufactured a significant portion of TRS-RenTelco’s communications test equipment, with the remainder acquired from over 40 other manufacturers. TRS-RenTelco’s general purpose test equipment rental inventory includes oscilloscopes, amplifiers, analyzers (spectrum, network and logic), signal source and power source test equipment. The communications test equipment rental inventory includes network and transmission test equipment for various fiber, copper and wireless networks. TRS-RenTelco occasionally rents electronic test equipment from other rental companies and re-rents the equipment to customers. Competitive Strengths Market Leadership - The Company believes that TRS-RenTelco is one of the largest electronic test equipment rental and leasing companies offering a broad and deep selection of general purpose and communications test equipment for rent in North America. Expertise - The Company believes that its knowledge of products, technology and applications expertise provides it with a competitive advantage over others in the industry. Customer requirements are supported by application engineers and technicians that are knowledgeable about the equipment’s uses to ensure the right equipment is selected to meet the customer’s needs. This knowledge can be attributed to the experience of TRS-RenTelco’s management, sales and operational teams. Operating Structure - TRS-RenTelco is supported by a centralized distribution and inventory center on the grounds of the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport in Texas. The Company believes that the centralization of servicing all customers in North America and internationally by TRS-RenTelco’s experienced logistics teams provides a competitive advantage by minimizing transaction costs and enabling TRS-RenTelco to ensure customer requirements are met. Asset Management - TRS-RenTelco’s rental equipment inventory is serviced by an ISO 9001-2015 registered and compliant calibration laboratory that repairs and calibrates equipment ensuring that off rent equipment is ready to ship immediately to meet customers’ needs. TRS-RenTelco’s team of technicians, product managers and sales personnel are continuously monitoring and analyzing the utilization of existing products, new technologies, general economic conditions and estimates of customer demand to ensure the right equipment is purchased and sold, at the right point in the equipment’s technology life cycle. The Company believes this enables it to maximize utilization of equipment and the cash flow generated by the rental and sales revenue of each model of equipment. TRS-RenTelco strives to maintain strong relationships with equipment manufacturers, which enables it to leverage those relationships to gain rental opportunities. -8- Customer Service - The Company believes that its focus on providing excellent service to its customers provides a competitive advantage. TRS-RenTelco strives to provide exemplary service to fulfill its commitments to its customers. TRS-RenTelco prides itself in providing solutions to meet customers’ needs by having equipment available and responding quickly and thoroughly to their requests. TRS-RenTelco’s sophisticated in-house laboratory ensures t he equipment is fully functional and meets its customers’ delivery requirements. Service needs of TRS-RenTelco’s customers are supported 24 hours a day, 7 days a week by its customer care specialists. TRS-RenTelco’s goal is to provide service beyond its c ustomers’ expectations, which, the Company believes, results in customer loyalty and repeat business. Market Electronic test equipment rental is a market which we estimate has equipment on rent worldwide or available for rent with an aggregate original cost in excess of $1 billion. There is a broad customer base for the rental of such instruments, including aerospace, communications, defense, electrical contractor, electronics, industrial, installer contractor, network systems and research companies. TRS-RenTelco markets its electronic test equipment throughout the United States, Canada, and, to a limited extent, other countries. TRS-RenTelco attracts customers through its outside sales force, website at www.TRSRenTelco.com, telemarketing program, trade show participation, paid internet search and electronic mail campaigns. A key part of the sales process is TRS-RenTelco’s knowledgeable inside sales engineering team that effectively matches test equipment solutions to meet specific customer’s requirements. The Company believes that customers rent electronic test equipment for many reasons. Customers frequently need equipment for short-term projects, to evaluate new products, and for backup to avoid costly downtime. Delivery times for the purchase of such equipment can be lengthy; thus, renting allows the customer to obtain the equipment expeditiously. The Company also believes that the relative certainty of rental costs can facilitate cost control and be useful in the bidding of and pass-through of contract costs. Finally, renting rather than purchasing may better satisfy the customer’s budgetary constraints. Rentals TRS-RenTelco rents electronic test equipment typically for rental periods of one to six months, although in some instances, rental terms can be up to a year or longer. Monthly rental rates typically are between 2% and 10% of the current manufacturers’ list price. TRS-RenTelco depreciates its equipment over 1 to 8 years with no residual value. At December 31, 2018, TRS-RenTelco had an electronic test equipment rental inventory including accessories with an aggregate cost of $285.1 million. Utilization is calculated each month by dividing the cost of the rental equipment on rent by the total cost of rental equipment, excluding accessory equipment. Utilization was 62.1% as of December 31, 2018 and averaged 62.7% during the year. Sales Profit from equipment sales is a material component of TRS-RenTelco’s overall annual earnings. Gross profit from sales of both used and new equipment over the last five years generally has ranged from approximately 20% to 23% of total annual gross profit for our electronics division. For 2018, gross profit on equipment sales was approximately 23% of total division gross profit. Equipment sales are driven by the turnover of older technology rental equipment, to maintain target utilization at a model number level, and new equipment sales opportunities. In 2018, approximately 19% of the electronic test equipment revenues were derived from sales. The largest electronic test equipment sale during 2018 represented approximately 5% of electronic test equipment sales, 1% of the Company’s consolidated sales and less than 1% of consolidated revenues. There is intense competition in the sales of electronic test equipment from a world-wide network of test equipment brokers and resellers, legacy rental companies, and equipment manufacturers. We believe the annual world-wide sale of electronic test equipment is in excess of $8.0 billion per year. Seasonality Rental activity may decline in the fourth quarter month of December and the first quarter months of January and February. These months may have lower rental activity due to holiday closures, particularly by larger companies, inclement weather and its impact on various field related communications equipment rentals, and companies’ operational recovery from holiday closures which may impact the start-up of new projects coming online in the first quarter. These factors may impact the quarterly results of each year’s first and fourth quarter. -9- Competition The electronic test equipment rental business is characterized by intense competition from several competitors, including Electro Rent Corporation, Continental Resources, and TestEquity, some of which may have access to greater financial and other resources than we do. TRS-RenTelco competes with these and other test equipment rental companies on the basis of product availability, price, service and reliability. Although no single competitor holds a dominant market share, we face intense competition from these established entities and new entrants in the market. Some of our competitors may offer similar equipment for lease, rental or sales at lower prices and may offer more extensive servicing, or financing options. -10- LIQUID AND SOLID CONTAINMENT TANKS AND B OXES Description Adler Tanks’ rental inventory is comprised of tanks and boxes used for various containment solutions to store hazardous and non-hazardous liquids and solids in applications such as: oil and gas exploration and field services, refinery, chemical and industrial plant maintenance, environmental remediation and field services, infrastructure building construction, marine services, pipeline construction and maintenance, tank terminals services, wastewater treatment, and waste management and landfill services. The tanks and boxes are comprised of the following products: • fixed axle steel tanks (“tanks”) for the storage of groundwater, wastewater, volatile organic liquids, sewage, slurry and bio sludge, oil and water mixtures and chemicals, which are available in a variety of sizes including 21,000 gallon, 16,000 gallon and 8,000 gallon sizes; • vacuum containers (“boxes”), which provide secure containment of sludge and solid materials and may be used for additional on-site storage or for transporting materials off-site enabling vacuum trucks to remain in operation; • dewatering boxes for the separation of water contained in sludge and slurry; and • roll-off and trash boxes for the temporary storage and transport of solid waste. Adler Tanks purchases tanks and boxes from various manufacturers located throughout the country. Competitive Strengths Market Leadership - The Company believes that Adler Tanks is one of the largest participants in the liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes rental business in North America. Adler Tanks has national reach from branches serving the Northeast, Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, Southeast, Southwest and West. Expertise and Customer Service – The Company believes that Adler Tanks has highly experienced operating management and branch employees. Adler Tanks employees are knowledgeable about the operation of its rental equipment and customer applications. The Company believes that Adler Tanks provides a superior level of customer service due to its strong relationship building skills and the quality of its responsiveness. Asset Management – The Company believes that Adler Tanks markets a high quality, well-constructed and well-maintained rental product. The Company depreciates its tanks and boxes over a 20 year estimated useful life to 0% residual value. We believe that if maintained, older tanks and boxes will continue to produce similar rental rates as newer equipment. The fleet’s utilization is regionally optimized by understanding key vertical market customer demand, seasonality factors, competitor’s product availability, expected equipment returns and manufacturer’s production capacity. Market Liquid and solid containment equipment rental is a market in the U.S with a large and diverse number of market segments including oil and gas exploration and field services, refinery, chemical and industrial plant maintenance, environmental remediation and field services, infrastructure building construction, marine services, pipeline construction and maintenance, electrical grid transformer maintenance, tank terminals services, wastewater treatment, and waste management and landfill services. The tank and box rental products that Adler Tanks builds may be utilized throughout the U.S. and are not subject to any local or regional construction code or approval standards. Rentals Adler Tanks rents tanks and boxes typically for rental periods of one to six months, although in some instances, rental terms can be up to a year or longer. Monthly rental rates typically are between 2% and 10% of the equipment’s original acquisition cost. At December 31, 2018, Adler Tanks had rental equipment inventory including accessories with an aggregate cost of $313.6 million. Utilization is calculated each month by dividing the cost of the rental equipment on rent by the total cost of rental equipment, excluding accessory equipment. Utilization was 56.4% at December 31, 2018 and averaged 59.9% during the year. -11- Seasonality Rental activity may decline in the fourth quarter month of December and the first quarter months of January and February. These months may have lower rental activity due to inclement weather in certain regions of the country impacting the industries that we serve. Competition The liquid and solid containment rental industry is highly competitive including national, regional and local companies. Some of our national competitors, notably BakerCorp (acquired by United Rentals in July 2018), Rain For Rent and Mobile Mini, may be larger than we are and may have greater financial and other resources than we have. Some of our competitors also have longer operating histories, lower cost basis of rental equipment, lower cost structures and more established relationships with equipment manufacturers than we have. In addition, certain of our competitors are more geographically diverse than we are and have greater name recognition among customers than we do. As a result, our competitors that have these advantages may be better able to attract and retain customers and provide their products and services at lower rental rates. Adler Tanks competes with these companies based upon product availability, product quality, price, service and reliability. We may encounter increased competition in the markets that we serve from existing competitors or from new market entrants in the future.

RISK FACTORS You should carefully consider the following discussion of various risks and uncertainties. We believe these risk factors are the most relevant to our business and could cause our results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements made by us. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be seriously harmed if any of these risks or uncertainties actually occur or materialize. In that event, the market price for our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment. Our future operating results may fluctuate, fail to match past performance or fail to meet expectations, which may result in a decrease in our stock price. Our operating results may fluctuate in the future, may fail to match our past performance or fail to meet the expectations of analysts and investors. Our results and related ratios, such as gross margin, operating income percentage and effective tax rate may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control including but not limited to: • general economic conditions in the geographies and industries where we rent and sell our products; • legislative and educational policies where we rent and sell our products; • the budgetary constraints of our customers; • seasonality of our rental businesses and our end-markets; • success of our strategic growth initiatives; • costs associated with the launching or integration of new or acquired businesses; • the timing and type of equipment purchases, rentals and sales; • the nature and duration of the equipment needs of our customers; • the timing of new product introductions by us, our suppliers and our competitors; • the volume, timing and mix of maintenance and repair work on our rental equipment; • our equipment mix, availability, utilization and pricing; • the mix, by state and country, of our revenues, personnel and assets; • rental equipment impairment from excess, obsolete or damaged equipment; • movements in interest rates or tax rates; • changes in, and application of, accounting rules; • changes in the regulations applicable to us; and • litigation matters. As a result of these factors, our historical financial results are not necessarily indicative of our future results or stock price. Our stock price has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate in the future, which may result in a decline in the value of your investment in our common stock. The market price of our common stock fluctuates on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and is likely to be affected by a number of factors including but not limited to: • our operating performance and the performance of our competitors, and in particular any variations in our operating results or dividend rate from our stated guidance or from investors’ expectations; • any changes in general conditions in the global economy, the industries in which we operate or the global financial markets; • investors’ reaction to our press releases, public announcements or filings with the SEC; • the stock price performance of our competitors or other comparable companies; • any changes in research analysts’ coverage, recommendations or earnings estimates for us or for the stocks of other companies in our industry; -15- • any sales of common stock by our directors, executive officers and our other large shareholders, particularly in light of the limi ted trading volume of our stock; • any merger and acquisition activity that involves us or our competitors; and • other announcements or developments affecting us, our industry, customers, suppliers or competitors. In addition, in recent years the U.S. stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations are often unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. Additionally, the most recent global credit crisis adversely affected the prices of most publicly traded stocks as many stockholders became more willing to divest their stock holdings at lower values to increase their cash flow and reduce exposure to such fluctuations. These broad market fluctuations and any other negative economic trends may cause declines in the market price of our common stock and may be based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our Company or its performance, and these fluctuations and trends could materially reduce our stock price. Our ability to retain our executive management and to recruit, retain and motivate key employees is critical to the success of our business. If we cannot successfully recruit and retain qualified personnel, our operating results and stock price may suffer. We believe that our success is directly linked to the competent people in our organization, including our executive officers, senior managers and other key personnel, and in particular, Joe Hanna, our Chief Executive Officer. Personnel turnover can be costly and could materially and adversely impact our operating results and can potentially jeopardize the success of our current strategic initiatives. We need to attract and retain highly qualified personnel to replace personnel when turnover occurs, as well as add to our staff levels as growth occurs. Our business and stock price likely will suffer if we are unable to fill, or experience delays in filling open positions, or fail to retain key personnel. Failure by third parties to manufacture and deliver our products to our specifications or on a timely basis may harm our reputation and financial condition. We depend on third parties to manufacture our products even though we are able to purchase products from a variety of third-party suppliers. In the future, we may be limited as to the number of third-party suppliers for some of our products. Although in general we make advance purchases of some products to help ensure an adequate supply, currently we do not have any long-term purchase contracts with any third-party supplier. We may experience supply problems as a result of financial or operating difficulties or failure of our suppliers, or shortages and discontinuations resulting from product obsolescence or other shortages or allocations by our suppliers. Unfavorable economic conditions may also adversely affect our suppliers or the terms on which we purchase products. In the future, we may not be able to negotiate arrangements with third parties to secure products that we require in sufficient quantities or on reasonable terms. If we cannot negotiate arrangements with third parties to produce our products or if the third parties fail to produce our products to our specifications or in a timely manner, our reputation and financial condition could be harmed. A breach of our information technology systems could subject us to liability, reputational damage or interrupt the operation of our business. We rely upon our information technology systems and infrastructure for our business. We could experience theft of confidential information or reputational damage from industrial espionage attacks, malware or other cyber-attacks, which may compromise our system infrastructure or lead to data leakage, either internally or at our third-party providers. Similarly, data privacy breaches by those who access our systems may pose a risk that sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information belonging to us, our employees, customers or other business partners, may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. Cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and have become increasingly difficult to detect. There can be no assurance that our efforts to protect our data and information technology systems will prevent breaches in our systems (or that of our third-party providers) that could adversely affect our business and result in financial and reputational harm to us, theft of trade secrets and other proprietary information, legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties. Disruptions in our information technology systems could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Additionally, if these systems fail, become unavailable for any period of time or are not upgraded, this could limit our ability to effectively monitor and control our operations and adversely affect our operations. Our information technology systems facilitate our ability to transact business, monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions. Any disruption in our information technology systems or the failure of these systems to operate as -16- expected could, depending on the magnitude of the problem, adversely affect our operating results by limitin g our capacity to effectively transact business, monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions in a timely manner. Further, the delay or failure to implement information system upgrades and new systems effectively could disrupt our business, distract management’s focus and attention from our business operations and growth initiatives, and increase our implementation and operating costs, any of which could negatively impact our operations and operating results. We have engaged in acquisitions and may engage in future acquisitions that could negatively impact our results of operations, financial condition and business. Previously, we acquired Technology Rentals & Services (“TRS”), an electronic test equipment rental business and Adler Tanks, a liquid and solid containment rental business. We anticipate that we will continue to consider acquisitions in the future that meet our strategic growth plans. We are unable to predict whether or when any prospective acquisition will be completed. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including the following: • difficulties in integrating the operations, technologies, products and personnel of the acquired companies; • diversion of management’s attention from normal daily operations of our business; • difficulties in entering markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors in such markets may have stronger market positions; • difficulties in complying with regulations applicable to any acquired business, such as environmental regulations, and managing risks related to an acquired business; • timely completion of necessary financing and required amendments, if any, to existing agreements; • an inability to implement uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies; • undiscovered and unknown problems, defects, damaged assets liabilities, or other issues related to any acquisition that become known to us only after the acquisition; • negative reactions from our customers to an acquisition; • disruptions among employees related to any acquisition which may erode employee morale; • loss of key employees, including costly litigation resulting from the termination of those employees; • an inability to realize cost efficiencies or synergies that we may anticipate when selecting acquisition candidates; • recording of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to future impairment testing and potential periodic impairment charges; • incurring amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets; and • becoming subject to litigation. Acquisitions are inherently risky, and no assurance can be given that our future acquisitions will be successful or will not adversely affect our business, operating results, or financial condition. The success of our acquisition strategy depends upon our ability to successfully complete acquisitions and integrate any businesses that we acquire into our existing business. The difficulties of integration could be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically dispersed organizations; maintaining acceptable standards, controls, procedures and policies; integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds; combining different corporate cultures; and the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management and other personnel. In addition, if we consummate one or more significant future acquisitions in which the consideration consists of stock or other securities, our existing shareholders’ ownership could be diluted significantly. If we were to proceed with one or more significant future acquisitions in which the consideration included cash, we could be required to use, to the extent available, a substantial portion of our Credit Facility. If we increase the amount borrowed against our available credit line, we would increase the risk of breaching the covenants under our credit facilities with our lenders. In addition, it would limit our ability to make other investments, or we may be required to seek additional debt or equity financing. Any of these items could adversely affect our results of operations. -17- If we determine that our goodwill and intangible assets have become impaired, we may incur impairment charges, which would negatively impact our operating results. At December 31, 2018, we had $35.1 million of goodwill and intangible assets, net, on our consolidated balance sheets. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, we assess potential impairment of our goodwill and intangible assets at least annually, as well as on an interim basis to the extent that factors or indicators become apparent that could reduce the fair value of any of our businesses below book value. Impairment may result from significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired asset, negative industry or economic trends and significant underperformance relative to historic or projected operating results. Our rental equipment is subject to residual value risk upon disposition, and may not sell at the prices or in the quantities we expect. The market value of any given piece of rental equipment could be less than its depreciated value at the time it is sold. The market value of used rental equipment depends on several factors, including: • the market price for new equipment of a like kind; • the age of the equipment at the time it is sold, as well as wear and tear on the equipment relative to its age; • the supply of used equipment on the market; • technological advances relating to the equipment; • worldwide and domestic demand for used equipment; and • general economic conditions. We include in income from operations the difference between the sales price and the depreciated value of an item of equipment sold. Changes in our assumptions regarding depreciation could change our depreciation expense, as well as the gain or loss realized upon disposal of equipment. Sales of our used rental equipment at prices that fall significantly below our projections or in lesser quantities than we anticipate will have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows. If we do not effectively manage our credit risk, collect on our accounts receivable or recover our rental equipment from our customers’ sites, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We generally rent and sell to customers on 30 day payment terms, individually perform credit evaluation procedures on our customers for each transaction and require security deposits or other forms of security from our customers when a significant credit risk is identified. Historically, accounts receivable write-offs and write-offs related to equipment not returned by customers have not been significant and have averaged less than 1% of total revenues over the last five years. If economic conditions deteriorate, we may see an increase in bad debt relative to historical levels, which may materially and adversely affect our operations. Business segments that experience significant market disruptions or declines may experience increased customer credit risk and higher bad debt expense. Failure to manage our credit risk and receive timely payments on our customer accounts receivable may result in write-offs and/or loss of equipment, particularly electronic test equipment. If we are not able to effectively manage credit risk issues, or if a large number of our customers should have financial difficulties at the same time, our receivables and equipment losses could increase above historical levels. If this should occur, our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected. Effective management of our rental assets is vital to our business. If we are not successful in these efforts, it could have a material adverse impact on our result of operations. Our modular, electronics and liquid and solid containment rental products have long useful lives and managing those assets is a critical element to each of our rental businesses. Generally, we design units and find manufacturers to build them to our specifications for our modular and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes. Modular asset management requires designing and building the product for a long life that anticipates the needs of our customers, including anticipating potential changes in legislation, regulations, building codes and local permitting in the various markets in which the Company operates. Electronic test equipment asset management requires understanding, selecting and investing in equipment technologies that support market demand, including anticipating technological advances and changes in manufacturers’ selling prices. Liquid and solid containment asset management requires designing and building the product for a long life, using quality components and repairing and maintaining the products to prevent leaks. For each of our modular, electronic test equipment and liquid and solid containment assets, we must successfully maintain and repair this equipment cost-effectively to maximize the useful life of the products and the level of proceeds from the sale of such products. To the extent that we are unable to do so, our result of operations could be materially adversely affected. -18- The nature of our businesses, including the ownership of industrial property, ex poses us to the risk of litigation and liability under environmental, health and safety and products liability laws. Violations of environmental or health and safety related laws or associated liability could have a material adverse effect on our business , financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to national, state, provincial and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, solid and liquid waste and hazardous substances handling, storage and disposal and employee health and safety. These laws and regulations are complex and frequently change. We could incur unexpected costs, penalties and other civil and criminal liability if we fail to comply with applicable environmental or health and safety laws. We also could incur costs or liabilities related to waste disposal or remediating soil or groundwater contamination at our properties, at our customers’ properties or at third party landfill and disposal sites. These liabilities can be imposed on the parties generating, transporting or disposing of such substances or on the owner or operator of any affected property, often without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of hazardous substances. Several aspects of our businesses involve risks of environmental and health and safety liability. For example, our operations involve the use of petroleum products, solvents and other hazardous substances in the construction and maintaining of modular buildings and for fueling and maintaining our delivery trucks and vehicles. We also own, transport and rent tanks and boxes in which waste materials are placed by our customers. The historical operations at some of our previously or currently owned or leased and newly acquired or leased properties may have resulted in undiscovered soil or groundwater contamination or historical non-compliance by third parties for which we could be held liable. Future events, such as changes in existing laws or policies or their enforcement, or the discovery of currently unknown contamination or non-compliance, may also give rise to liabilities or other claims based on these operations that may be material. In addition, compliance with future environmental or health and safety laws and regulations may require significant capital or operational expenditures or changes to our operations. Accordingly, in addition to potential penalties for non-compliance, we may become liable, either contractually or by operation of law, for investigation, remediation and monitoring costs even if the contaminated property is not presently owned or operated by us, or if the contamination was caused by third parties during or prior to our ownership or operation of the property. In addition, certain parties may be held liable for more than their “fair” share of environmental investigation and cleanup costs. Contamination and exposure to hazardous substances or other contaminants such as mold can also result in claims for remediation or damages, including personal injury, property damage, and natural resources damage claims. Although expenses related to environmental compliance, health and safety issues, and related matters have not been material to date, we cannot assure that we will not have to make significant expenditures in the future in order to comply with applicable laws and regulations. Violations of environmental or health and safety related laws or associated liability could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In general, litigation in the industries in which we operate, including class actions that seek substantial damages, arises with increasing frequency. Enforcement of environmental and health and safety requirements is also frequent. Such proceedings are invariably expensive, regardless of the merit of the plaintiffs’ or prosecutors’ claims. We may be named as a defendant in the future, and there can be no assurance, irrespective of the merit of such future actions, that we will not be required to make substantial settlement payments in the future. Further, a significant portion of our business is conducted in California which is one of the most highly regulated and litigious states in the country. Therefore, our potential exposure to losses and expenses due to new laws, regulations or litigation may be greater than companies with a less significant California presence. The nature of our business also subjects us to property damage and product liability claims, especially in connection with our modular buildings and tank and box rental businesses. Although we maintain liability coverage that we believe is commercially reasonable, an unusually large property damage or product liability claim or a series of claims could exceed our insurance coverage or result in damage to our reputation. Our routine business activities expose us to risk of litigation from employees, vendors and other third parties, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We may be subject to claims arising from disputes with employees, vendors and other third parties in the normal course of our business; these risks may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. If the plaintiffs in any suits against us were to successfully prosecute their claims, or if we were to settle any such suits by making significant payments to the plaintiffs, our operating results and financial condition would be harmed. Even if the outcome of a claim proves favorable to us, litigation can be time consuming and costly and may divert management resources. In addition, our organizational documents require us to indemnify our senior executives to the maximum extent permitted by California law. We maintain directors’ and officers’ liability insurance that we believe is commercially reasonable in connection with such obligations, but if our senior executives were named in any lawsuit, our indemnification obligations could magnify the costs of these suits and/or exceed the coverage of such policies. -19- If we suffer loss to our facilities, equipment or distribution system due to catastrophe, our insurance policies could be inadequate or depleted, our operations could be seriously harmed, which could nega tively affect our operating results. Our facilities, rental equipment and distribution systems may be subject to catastrophic loss due to fire, flood, hurricane, earthquake, terrorism or other natural or man-made disasters. In particular, our headquarters, three operating facilities, and certain of our rental equipment are located in areas of California, with above average seismic activity and could be subject to catastrophic loss caused by an earthquake. Our rental equipment and facilities in Texas, Florida, North Carolina and Georgia are located in areas subject to hurricanes and other tropical storms. In addition to customers’ insurance on rented equipment, we carry property insurance on our rental equipment in inventory and operating facilities as well as business interruption insurance. We believe our insurance policies have adequate limits and deductibles to mitigate the potential loss exposure of our business. We do not maintain financial reserves for policy deductibles and our insurance policies contain exclusions that are customary for our industry, including exclusions for earthquakes, flood and terrorism. If any of our facilities or a significant amount of our rental equipment were to experience a catastrophic loss, it could disrupt our operations, delay orders, shipments and revenue recognition and result in expenses to repair or replace the damaged rental equipment and facility not covered by insurance, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Our debt instruments contain covenants that restrict or prohibit our ability to enter into a variety of transactions and may limit our ability to finance future operations or capital needs. If we have an event of default under these instruments, our indebtedness could be accelerated and we may not be able to refinance such indebtedness or make the required accelerated payments. The agreements governing our Series B and Series C Senior Notes (as defined and more fully described under the heading “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources”) and our Credit Facility contain various covenants that limit our discretion in operating our business. In particular, we are limited in our ability to merge, consolidate, reorganize or transfer substantially all of our assets, make investments, pay dividends or distributions, redeem or repurchase stock, change the nature of our business, enter into transactions with affiliates, incur indebtedness and create liens on our assets to secure debt. In addition, we are required to meet certain financial covenants under these instruments. These restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financing, make strategic acquisitions or needed capital expenditures, withstand economic downturns in our business or the economy in general, conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise. A failure to comply with the restrictions contained in these agreements could lead to an event of default, which could result in an acceleration of our indebtedness. In the event of an acceleration, we may not have or be able to obtain sufficient funds to refinance our indebtedness or make any required accelerated payments. If we default on our indebtedness, our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. The majority of our indebtedness is subject to variable interest rates, which makes us vulnerable to increases in interest rates, which could negatively affect our net income. Our indebtedness exposes us to interest rate increases because the majority of our indebtedness is subject to variable rates. At present, we do not have any derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps or hedges to mitigate interest rate variability. The interest rates under our credit facilities are reset at varying periods. These interest rate adjustments could cause periodic fluctuations in our operating results and cash flows. Our annual debt service obligations increase by approximately $2.0 million per year for each 1% increase in the average interest rate we pay based on the $198.6 million balance of variable rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2018. If interest rates rise in the future, and, particularly if they rise significantly, interest expense will increase and our net income will be negatively affected. Our effective tax rate may change and become less predictable as our business expands, making our future earnings less predictable. We continue to consider expansion opportunities domestically and internationally for our rental businesses. Since the Company’s effective tax rate depends on business levels, personnel and assets located in various jurisdictions, further expansion into new markets or acquisitions may change the effective tax rate in the future and may make it, and consequently our earnings, less predictable going forward. In addition, the enactment of future tax law changes by federal and state taxing authorities may impact the Company’s current period tax provision and its deferred tax liabilities. -20- Changes in financial accounting standards may cause lower than expected operating results and affect our reported results of operations. Changes in accounting standards and their application may have a significant effect on our reported results on a going-forward basis and may also affect the recording and disclosure of previously reported transactions. New accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred in the past and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way we conduct our business. Failure to comply with internal control attestation requirements could lead to loss of public confidence in our financial statements and negatively impact our stock price. As a public reporting company, we are required to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, including Section 404, and the related rules and regulations of the SEC, including expanded disclosures and accelerated reporting requirements. Compliance with Section 404 and other related requirements has increased our costs and will continue to require additional management resources. We may need to continue to implement additional finance and accounting systems, procedures and controls to satisfy new reporting requirements. While our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 was effective, there is no assurance that future assessments of the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting will be favorable. If we are unable to obtain future unqualified reports as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our internal control over financial reporting, which could adversely affect our stock price. SPECIFIC RISKS RELATED TO OUR RELOCATABLE MODULAR BUILDINGS BUSINESS SEGMENT: Significant reductions of, or delays in, funding to public schools have caused the demand and pricing for our modular classroom units to decline, which has in the past caused, and may cause in the future, a reduction in our revenues and profitability. Rentals and sales of modular buildings to public school districts for use as classrooms, restroom buildings, and administrative offices for K-12 represent a significant portion of Mobile Modular’s rental and sales revenues. Funding for public school facilities is derived from a variety of sources including the passage of both statewide and local facility bond measures, developer fees and various taxes levied to support school operating budgets. Many of these funding sources are subject to financial and political considerations, which vary from district to district and are not tied to demand. Historically, we have benefited from the passage of statewide and local facility bond measures and believe these are essential to our business. The state of California is our largest market for classroom rentals. The strength of this market depends heavily on public funding from voter passage of both state and local facility bond measures, and the ability of the state to sell such bonds in the public market. A lack of passage of state and local facility bond measures, or the inability to sell bonds in the public markets in the future could reduce our revenues and operating income, and consequently have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition. Furthermore, even if voters have approved facility bond measures and the state has raised bond funds, there is no guarantee that individual school projects will be funded in a timely manner. As a consequence of the most recent economic recession, many states and local governments experienced large budget deficits resulting in severe budgetary constraints among public school districts. To the extent public school districts’ funding is reduced for the rental and purchase of modular buildings, our business could be harmed and our results of operations negatively impacted. We believe that interruptions or delays in the passage of facility bond measures or completion of state budgets, an insufficient amount of state funding, a significant reduction of funding to public schools, or changes negatively impacting enrollment may reduce the rental and sale demand for our educational products. Any reductions in funding available to the school districts from the states in which we do business may cause school districts to experience budget shortfalls and to reduce their demand for our products despite growing student populations, class size reduction initiatives and modernization and reconstruction project needs, which could reduce our revenues and operating income and consequently have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition. Public policies that create demand for our products and services may change, resulting in decreased demand for or the pricing of our products and services, which could negatively affect our revenues and operating income. Various states that we operate enacted laws and constitutional amendments to provide funding for school districts to limit the number of students that may be grouped in a single classroom. School districts with class sizes in excess of state limits have been and continue to be a significant source of our demand for modular classrooms. In California, efforts to address aging infrastructure and deferred maintenance have resulted in modernization and reconstruction projects by public school districts including seismic retrofitting, asbestos abatement and various building repairs and upgrades, which has been another source of demand for our modular classrooms. The most recent economic recession caused state and local budget shortfalls, which reduced school districts’ funding and -21- their ability to comply with state class size reduction requirements. If educational priorities and policies shift away from class-size reduction or modernization and reconstruction projects, demand and pricing for our products and services may decline, not grow as quickly as, or not reach the levels that we anticipate. Significant equipment returns may result in lower utilization until equipment can be redeployed or sold, which may cause ren tal rates to decline and negatively affect our revenues and operating income. Failure to comply with applicable regulations could harm our business and financial condition, resulting in lower operating results and cash flows. Similar to conventionally constructed buildings, the modular building industry, including the manufacturers and lessors of portable classrooms, are subject to regulations by multiple governmental agencies at the federal, state and local level relating to environmental, zoning, health, safety, energy efficiency, labor and transportation matters, among other matters. Failure to comply with these laws or regulations could impact our business or harm our reputation and result in higher capital or operating expenditures or the imposition of penalties or restrictions on our operations. As with conventional construction, typically new codes and regulations are not retroactively applied. Nonetheless, new governmental regulations in these or other areas may increase our acquisition cost of new rental equipment, limit the use of or make obsolete some of our existing equipment, or increase our costs of rental operations. Building codes are generally reviewed every three years. All aspects of a given code are subject to change including, but not limited to, such items as structural specifications for earthquake safety, energy efficiency and environmental standards, fire and life safety, transportation, lighting and noise limits. On occasion, state agencies have undertaken studies of indoor air quality and noise levels with a focus on permanent and modular classrooms. These results could impact our existing modular equipment and affect the future construction of our modular product. Compliance with building codes and regulations entails a certain amount of risk as state and local government authorities do not necessarily interpret building codes and regulations in a consistent manner, particularly where applicable regulations may be unclear and subject to interpretation. These regulations often provide broad discretion to governmental authorities that oversee these matters, which can result in unanticipated delays or increases in the cost of compliance in particular markets. The construction and modular industries have developed many “best practices” which are constantly evolving. Some of our peers and competitors may adopt practices that are more or less stringent than the Company’s. When, and if, regulatory standards are clarified, the effect of the clarification may be to impose rules on our business and practices retroactively, at which time, we may not be in compliance with such regulations and we may be required to incur costly remediation. If we are unable to pass these increased costs on to our customers, our profitability, operating cash flows and financial condition could be negatively impacted. Expansions of our modular operations into new markets may negatively affect our operating results. In the past we have expanded our modular operations into new geographies and states. There are risks inherent in the undertaking of such expansion, including the risk of revenue from the business in any new markets not meeting our expectations, higher than expected costs in entering these new markets, risk associated with compliance with applicable state and local laws and regulations, response by competitors and unanticipated consequences of expansion. In addition, expansion into new markets may be affected by local economic and market conditions. Expansion of our operations into new markets will require a significant amount of attention from our management, a commitment of financial resources and will require us to add qualified management in these markets, which may negatively impact our operating results. We are subject to laws and regulations governing government contracts. These laws and regulations make these government contracts more favorable to government entities than other third parties and any changes in these laws and regulations, or our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could harm our business. We have agreements relating to the sale of our products to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. The laws governing government contracts differ from the laws governing private contracts. For example, many government contracts contain pricing terms and conditions that are not applicable to private contracts such as clauses that allow government entities not to perform on contractual obligations in the case of a lack of fiscal funding. Also, in the educational markets we serve, we are able to utilize “piggyback” contracts in marketing our products and services and ultimately to book business. The term “piggyback” contract refers to contracts for portable classrooms or other products entered into by public school districts following a formal bid process that allows for the use of the same contract terms and conditions with the successful vendor by other public school districts. As a result, “piggyback” contracts allow us to more readily book orders from our government customers, primarily public school districts, and to reduce the administrative expense associated with booking these orders. The governmental statutes and regulations that allow for use of “piggyback” contracts are subject to change or elimination in their entirety. A change in the manner of use or the elimination of “piggyback” contracts would likely negatively -22- impact our ability to book new business from thes e government customers and could cause our administrative expenses related to processing these orders to increase significantly. In addition, any failure to comply with these laws and regulations might result in administrative penalties or even in the sus pension of these contracts and as a result, the loss of the related revenues which would harm our business and results from operations. Seasonality of our educational business may have adverse consequences for our business. A significant portion of the modular sale and rental revenues is derived from the educational market. Typically, during each calendar year, our highest numbers of classrooms are shipped for rental and sale orders during the second and third quarters for delivery and installation prior to the start of the upcoming school year. The majority of classrooms shipped in the second and third quarters have rental start dates during the third quarter, thereby making the fourth quarter the first full quarter of rental revenues recognized for these transactions. Although this is the historical seasonality of our business, it is subject to change or may not meet our expectations, which may have adverse consequences for our business. We face strong competition in our modular building markets and we may not be able to effectively compete. The modular building leasing industry is highly competitive in our states of operation and we expect it to remain so. The competitive market in which we operate may prevent us from raising rental fees or sales prices to pass any increased costs on to our customers. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including equipment availability, quality, price, service, reliability, appearance, functionality and delivery terms. We may experience pricing pressures in our areas of operation in the future as some of our competitors seek to obtain market share by reducing prices. Some of our larger national competitors in the modular building leasing industry, notably WillScot Corporation, have a greater range of products and services, greater financial and marketing resources, larger customer bases, and greater name recognition than we have. In August 2018, WillScot Corporation completed the acquisition of Modspace. These combined competitors may be better able to respond to changes in the relocatable modular building market, to finance acquisitions, to fund internal growth and to compete for market share, any of which could harm our business. We may not be able to quickly redeploy modular units returning from leases, which could negatively affect our financial performance and our ability to expand, or utilize, our rental fleet. As of December 31, 2018, 54% of our modular portfolio had equipment on rent for periods exceeding the original committed term. Generally, when a customer continues to rent the modular units beyond the contractual term, the equipment rents on a month-to-month basis. If a significant number of our rented modular units were returned during a short period of time, particularly those units that are rented on a month-to-month basis, a large supply of units would need to be remarketed. Our failure to effectively remarket a large influx of units returning from leases could negatively affect our financial performance and our ability to continue expanding our rental fleet. In addition, if returned units stay off rent for an extended period of time, we may incur additional costs to securely store and maintain them. Significant increases in raw material and labor costs could increase our acquisition cost of new modular rental units and repair and maintenance costs of our fleet, which would increase our operating costs and harm our profitability. We incur labor costs and purchase raw materials, including lumber, siding and roofing and other products to perform periodic repairs, modifications and refurbishments to maintain physical conditions of our modular units. The volume, timing and mix of maintenance and repair work on our rental equipment may vary quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year. Generally, increases in labor and raw material costs will also increase the acquisition cost of new modular units and increase the repair and maintenance costs of our fleet. We also maintain a fleet of service trucks and use subcontractor companies for the delivery, set-up, return delivery and dismantle of modulars for our customers. We rely on our subcontractor service companies to meet customer demands for timely shipment and return, and the loss or inadequate number of subcontractor service companies may cause prices to increase, while negatively impacting our reputation and operating performance. During periods of rising prices for labor, raw materials or fuel, and in particular, when the prices increase rapidly or to levels significantly higher than normal, we may incur significant increases in our acquisition costs for new modular units and incur higher operating costs that we may not be able to recoup from our customers, which would reduce our profitability. Failure by third parties to manufacture our products timely or properly may harm our reputation and financial condition. We are dependent on third parties to manufacture our products even though we are able to purchase products from a variety of third-party suppliers. Mobile Modular purchases new modulars from various manufacturers who build to Mobile Modular’s design specifications. With the exception of Enviroplex, none of the principal suppliers are affiliated with the Company. During 2018, -23- Mobile Modular purchased 33 % of its modular product from one manufactu rer. The Company believes that the loss of any of its primary manufacturers of modulars could have an adverse effect on its operations since Mobile Modular could experience higher prices and longer delivery lead times for modular product until other manuf acturers were able to increase their production capacity. Failure to properly design, manufacture, repair and maintain the modular product may result in impairment charges, potential litigation and reduction of our operating results and cash flows. We estimate the useful life of the modular product to be 18 years with a residual value of 50%. However, proper design, manufacture, repairs and maintenance of the modular product during our ownership is required for the product to reach the estimated useful life of 18 years with a residual value of 50%. If we do not appropriately manage the design, manufacture, repair and maintenance of our modular product, or otherwise delay or defer such repair or maintenance, we may be required to incur impairment charges for equipment that is beyond economic repair costs or incur significant capital expenditures to acquire new modular product to serve demand. In addition, such failures may result in personal injury or property damage claims, including claims based on presence of mold, and termination of leases or contracts by customers. Costs of contract performance, potential litigation, and profits lost from termination could accordingly reduce our future operating results and cash flows. Our warranty costs may increase and warranty claims could damage our reputation and negatively impact our revenues and operating income. Sales of new relocatable modular buildings not manufactured by us are typically covered by warranties provided by the manufacturer of the products sold. We provide ninety-day warranties on certain modular sales of used rental units and one-year warranties on equipment manufactured by our Enviroplex subsidiary. Historically, our warranty costs have not been significant, and we monitor the quality of our products closely. If a defect were to arise in the installation of our equipment at the customer’s facilities or in the equipment acquired from our suppliers or by our Enviroplex subsidiary, we may experience increased warranty claims. Such claims could disrupt our sales operations, damage our reputation and require costly repairs or other remedies, negatively impacting revenues and operating income. SPECIFIC RISKS RELATED TO OUR ELECTRONIC TEST EQUIPMENT BUSINESS SEGMENT: Market risk and cyclical downturns in the industries using test equipment may result in periods of low demand for our product resulting in excess inventory, impairment charges and reduction of our operating results and cash flows. TRS-RenTelco’s revenues are derived from the rental and sale of general purpose and communications test equipment to a broad range of companies, from Fortune 500 to middle and smaller market companies, in the aerospace, defense, communications, manufacturing and semiconductor industries. Electronic test equipment rental and sales revenues are primarily affected by the business activity within these industries related to research and development, manufacturing, and communication infrastructure installation and maintenance. Historically, these industries have been cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns, which can have a material adverse impact on the industry’s demand for equipment, including our rental electronic test equipment. In addition, the severity and length of any downturn in an industry may also affect overall access to capital, which could adversely affect our customers and result in excess inventory and impairment charges. During periods of reduced and declining demand for test equipment, we are exposed to additional receivable risk from non-payment and may need to rapidly align our cost structure with prevailing market conditions, which may negatively impact our operating results and cash flows. Seasonality of our electronic test equipment business may impact quarterly results. Generally, rental activity declines in the fourth quarter month of December and the first quarter months of January and February. These months may have lower rental activity due to holiday closures, particularly by larger companies, inclement weather and its impact on various field related communications equipment rentals, and companies’ operational recovery from holiday closures which may impact the start-up of new projects coming online in the first quarter. These seasonal factors historically have impacted quarterly results in each year’s first and fourth quarter, but we are unable to predict how such factors may impact future periods. Our rental test equipment may become obsolete or may no longer be supported by a manufacturer, which could result in an impairment charge. Electronic test equipment is characterized by changing technology and evolving industry standards that may render our existing equipment obsolete through new product introductions, or enhancements, before the end of its anticipated useful life, causing us to incur impairment charges. We must anticipate and keep pace with the introduction of new hardware, software and networking technologies and acquire equipment that will be marketable to our current and prospective customers. -24- Additionally, some ma nufacturers of our equipment may be acquired or cease to exist, resulting in a future lack of support for equipment purchased from those manufacturers. This could result in the remaining useful life becoming shorter, causing us to incur an impairment cha rge. We monitor our manufacturers’ capacity to support their products and the introduction of new technologies, and we acquire equipment that will be marketable to our current and prospective customers. However, any prolonged economic downturn could resul t in unexpected bankruptcies or reduced support from our manufacturers. Failure to properly select, manage and respond to the technological needs of our customers and changes to our products through their technology life cycle may cause certain electronic test equipment to become obsolete, resulting in impairment charges, which may negatively impact operating results and cash flows. If we do not effectively compete in the rental equipment market, our operating results will be materially and adversely affected. The electronic test equipment rental business is characterized by intense competition from several competitors, including Electro Rent Corporation, Continental Resources and TestEquity, some of which may have access to greater financial and other resources than we do. Although no single competitor holds a dominant market share, we face competition from these established entities and new entrants in the market. We believe that we anticipate and keep pace with the introduction of new products and acquire equipment that will be marketable to our current and prospective customers. We compete on the basis of a number of factors, including product availability, price, service and reliability. Some of our competitors may offer similar equipment for lease, rental or sale at lower prices and may offer more extensive servicing, or financing options. Failure to adequately forecast the adoption of, and demand for, new or existing products may cause us not to meet our customers’ equipment requirements and may materially and adversely affect our operating results. If we are not able to obtain equipment at favorable rates, there could be a material adverse effect on our operating results and reputation. The majority of our rental equipment portfolio is comprised of general purpose test and measurement instruments purchased from leading manufacturers such as Keysight Technologies (formerly Agilent Technologies) and Tektronix, a division of Fortive Corporation. We depend on purchasing equipment from these manufacturers and suppliers for use as our rental equipment. If, in the future, we are not able to purchase necessary equipment from one or more of these suppliers on favorable terms, we may not be able to meet our customers’ demands in a timely manner or for a rental rate that generates a profit. If this should occur, we may not be able to secure necessary equipment from an alternative source on acceptable terms and our business and reputation may be materially and adversely affected. If we are not able to anticipate and mitigate the risks associated with operating internationally, there could be a material adverse effect on our operating results. Currently, total foreign country customers and operations account for less than 10% of the Company’s revenues. In recent years some of our customers have expanded their international operations faster than domestic operations, and this trend may continue. Over time, we anticipate the amount of our international business may increase if our focus on international market opportunities continues. Operating in foreign countries subjects the Company to additional risks, any of which may adversely impact our future operating results, including: • international political, economic and legal conditions including tariffs and trade barriers; • our ability to comply with customs, anti-corruption, import/export and other trade compliance regulations, together with any unexpected changes in such regulations; • greater difficulty in our ability to recover rental equipment and obtain payment of the related trade receivables; • additional costs to establish and maintain international subsidiaries and related operations; • difficulties in attracting and retaining staff and business partners to operate internationally; • language and cultural barriers; • seasonal reductions in business activities in the countries where our international customers are located; • difficulty with the integration of foreign operations; • longer payment cycles; -25- • currency fluctuations; and • potential adverse tax consequences. Unfavorable currency exchange rates may negatively impact our financial results in U.S. dollar terms. We receive revenues in Canadian dollars from our business activities in Canada. Conducting business in currencies other than U.S. dollars subjects us to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. If the currency exchange rates change unfavorably, the value of net receivables we receive in foreign currencies and later convert to U.S. dollars after the unfavorable change would be diminished. This could have a negative impact on our reported operating results. We currently do not engage in hedging strategies to mitigate this risk. SPECIFIC RISKS RELATED TO OUR LIQUID AND SOLID CONTAINMENT TANKS AND BOXES BUSINESS SEGMENT: We may be brought into tort or environmental litigation or held responsible for cleanup of spills if the customer fails to perform, or an accident occurs in the use of our rental products, which could materially adversely affect our business, future operating results or financial position. Our rental tanks and boxes are used by our customers to store non-hazardous and certain hazardous liquids and solids on the customer’s site. Our customers are generally responsible for proper operation of our tank and box rental equipment while on rent and returning a cleaned and undamaged container upon completion of use, but exceptions may be granted and we cannot always assure that these responsibilities are fully met in all cases. Although we require the customer to carry commercial general liability insurance in a minimum amount of $5,000,000, such policies often contain pollution exclusions and other exceptions. Furthermore, we cannot be certain our liability insurance will always be sufficient. In addition, if an accident were to occur involving our rental equipment or a spill of substances were to occur when the tank or box was in transport or on rent with our customer, a claim could be made against us as owner of the rental equipment. In the event of a spill or accident, we may be brought into a lawsuit or enforcement action by either our customer or a third party on numerous potential grounds, including an allegation that an inherent flaw in a tank or box contributed to an accident or that the tank had suffered some undiscovered harm from a previous customer’s prior use. In the event of a spill caused by our customers, we may be held responsible for cleanup under environmental laws and regulations concerning obligations of suppliers of rental products to effect remediation. In addition, applicable environmental laws and regulations may impose liability on us for the conduct of third parties, or for actions that complied with applicable regulations when taken, regardless of negligence or fault. Substantial damage awards have also been made in certain jurisdictions against lessors of industrial equipment based upon claims of personal injury, property damage, and resource damage caused by the use of various products. While we take what we believe are reasonable precautions that our rental equipment is in good and safe condition prior to rental and carry insurance to protect against certain risks of loss or accidents, such liability could adversely impact our profitability. The liquid and solid containment rental industry is highly competitive, and competitive pressures could lead to a decrease in our market share or in rental rates and our ability to rent, or sell, equipment at favorable prices, which could adversely affect our operating results. The liquid and solid containment rental industry is highly competitive. We compete against national, regional and local companies, including United Rentals, Rain For Rent and Mobile Mini, all of which may be larger than we are and may have greater financial and marketing resources than we have. Some of our competitors also have longer operating histories, lower cost basis of rental equipment, lower cost structures and more established relationships with equipment manufacturers than we have. In addition, certain of our competitors are more geographically diverse than we are and have greater name recognition among customers than we do. As a result, our competitors that have these advantages may be better able to attract customers and provide their products and services at lower rental rates. Some competitors offer different approaches to liquid storage, such as large-volume modular tanks that may have better economics and compete with conventional frac tanks in certain oil and gas field applications. We may in the future encounter increased competition in the markets that we serve from existing competitors or from new market entrants. In July 2018, United Rentals, Inc. completed the acquisition of BakerCorp. This acquisition may create additional competition for customers and provide the combined entity access to greater financial resources than we have. We believe that equipment quality, service levels, rental rates and fleet size are key competitive factors in the liquid and solid containment rental industry. From time to time, we or our competitors may attempt to compete aggressively by lowering rental rates or prices. Competitive pressures could adversely affect our revenues and operating results by decreasing our market share or depressing rental rates. To the extent we lower rental rates or increase our fleet in order to retain or increase market share, our operating margins would be adversely impacted. In addition, we may not be able to match a larger competitor’s price reductions or -26- fleet investment because of its greater financial resources, all of which could adversely impact our operating resul ts through a combination of a decrease in our market share, revenues and operating income. Market risk, commodity price volatility, regulatory changes or interruptions and cyclical downturns in the industries using tanks and boxes may result in periods of low demand for our products resulting in excess inventory, impairment charges and reduction of our operating results and cash flows. Adler Tanks’ revenues are derived from the rental of tanks and boxes to companies involved in oil and gas exploration, extraction and refinement, environmental remediation and wastewater/groundwater treatment, infrastructure and building construction and various industrial services, among others. We expect tank and box rental revenues will primarily be affected by the business activity within these industries. Historically, these industries have been cyclical and have experienced periodic downturns, which have a material adverse impact on the industry’s demand for equipment, including the tanks and boxes rented by us. Lower oil or gas prices may have an adverse effect on our liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes business. Any steep decline in both domestic and international oil prices driven by materially higher supply levels and weak demand could have a significant negative impact on the industry’s demand for equipment, especially if such market conditions continue for an extended period of time. If the price reduction causes customers to limit or stop exploration, extraction or refinement activities, resulting in lower demand and pricing for renting Adler Tank’s products, our financial results could be adversely impacted. Also, a weak U.S. economy may negatively impact infrastructure construction and industrial activity. Any of these factors may result in excess inventory or impairment charges and reduce our operating results and cash flows. Changes in regulatory, or governmental, oversight of hydraulic fracturing could materially adversely affect the demand for our rental products and reduce our operating results and cash flows. We believe that demand related to hydraulic fracturing has increased the total rental revenues and market size in recent years. Oil and gas exploration and extraction (including use of tanks for hydraulic fracturing to obtain shale oil and shale gas) are subject to numerous local, state and federal regulations. In the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, oil and gas exploration and production accounted for approximately 10% of Adler Tanks’ rental revenues, and approximately 2% of the Company’s total revenues. The hydraulic fracturing method of extraction has come under scrutiny in several states and by the Federal government due to the potential adverse effects that hydraulic fracturing, and the liquids and chemicals used, may have on water quality and public health. In addition, the disposal of wastewater from the hydraulic fracturing process into injection wells may increase the rate of seismic activity near drill sites and could result in regulatory changes, delays or interruption of future activity. Changes in these regulations could limit, interrupt, or stop exploration and extraction activities, which would negatively impact the demand for our rental products. Finally, it is possible that changes in the technology utilized in hydraulic fracturing could make it less dependent on liquids and therefore lower the related requirements for the use of our rental products, which would reduce our operating results and cash flows. Seasonality of the liquid and solid containment rental industry may impact quarterly results. Rental activity may decline in the fourth quarter month of December and the first quarter months of January and February. These months may have lower rental activity in parts of the country where inclement weather may delay, or suspend, a company’s project. The impact of these delays may be to decrease the number of tanks, or boxes, on rent until companies are able to resume their projects when weather improves. These seasonal factors historically have impacted quarterly results in each year’s first and fourth quarter, but we are unable to predict how such factors may impact future periods. Significant increases in raw material, fuel and labor costs could increase our acquisition and operating costs of rental equipment, which would increase operating costs and decrease profitability. Increases in raw material costs such as steel and labor to manufacture liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes would increase the cost of acquiring new equipment. These price increases could materially and adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations if we are not able to recoup these increases through higher rental revenues. In addition, a significant amount of revenues are generated from the transport of rental equipment to and from customers. We own delivery trucks, employ drivers and utilize subcontractors to provide these services. The price of fuel can be unpredictable and beyond our control. During periods of rising fuel and labor costs, and in particular when prices increase rapidly, we may not be able recoup these costs from our customers, which would reduce our profitability. Failure by third parties to manufacture our products timely or properly may harm our ability to meet customer demand and harm our financial condition. We are dependent on a variety of third party companies to manufacture equipment to be used in our rental fleet. In some cases, we may not be able to procure equipment on a timely basis to the extent that manufacturers for the quantities of equipment we need -27- are not able to produce sufficient inventory on schedules that meet our delivery requirements. If demand for new equipment increases significantly, especially during a seasonal manufacturing slowdown, manufacturers may not be able to mee t customer orders on a timely basis. As a result, we at times may experience long lead-times for certain types of new equipment and we cannot assure that we will be able to acquire the types or sufficient numbers of the equipment we need to grow our renta l fleet as quickly as we would like and this could harm our ability to meet customer demand and harm our financial condition. We derive a meaningful amount of our revenue in our liquid and solid containment tank and boxes business from a limited number of customers, the loss of one or more of which could have an adverse effect on our business. Periodically, a meaningful portion of our revenue in our liquid and solid containment tank and boxes business may be generated from a few major customers. Although we have some long-term relationships with our major customers, we cannot be assured that our customers will continue to use our products or services or that they will continue to do so at historical levels. The loss of any meaningful customer, the failure to collect a material receivable from a meaningful customer, any material reduction in orders by a meaningful customer or the cancellation of a meaningful customer order could significantly reduce our revenues and consequently harm our financial condition and our ability to fund our operations. We may not be able to quickly redeploy equipment returning from leases at equivalent prices. Many of our rental transactions are short-term in nature with pricing established on a daily basis. The length of time that a customer needs equipment can often be difficult to determine and can be impacted by a number of factors such as weather, customer funding and project delays. In addition, our equipment is primarily used in the oil and gas, industrial plant services, environmental remediation and infrastructure and building construction industries. Changes in the economic conditions facing any of those industries could result in a significant number of units returning off rent, both for us and our competitors. If the supply of rental equipment available on the market significantly increases due to units coming off rent, demand for and pricing of our rental products could be adversely impacted. We may experience delays in remarketing our off-rent units to new customers and incur cost to move the units to other regions where demand is stronger. Actions in these circumstances by our competitors may also depress the market price for rental units. These delays and price pressures would adversely affect equipment utilization levels and total revenues, which would reduce our profitability. ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS None. ITEM 2.

The Company presents Adjusted EBITDA as a financial measure as management believes it provides useful information to investors regarding the Company’s liquidity and financial condition and because management, as well as the Company’s lenders, use this measure in evaluating the performance of the Company. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a supplement to GAAP measures to further evaluate period-to-period operating performance, compliance with financial covenants in the Company’s revolving lines of credit and senior notes and the Company’s ability to meet future capital expenditure and working capital requirements. Management believes the exclusion of non-cash charges, including share-based compensation, is useful in measuring the Company’s cash available for operations and performance of the Company. Because management finds Adjusted EBITDA useful, the Company believes its investors will also find Adjusted EBITDA useful in evaluating the Company’s performance. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net income, cash flows, or other consolidated income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with GAAP or as a measure of the Company’s profitability or liquidity. Adjusted EBITDA is not in accordance with or an alternative for GAAP, and may be different from non−GAAP measures used by other companies. Unlike EBITDA, which may be used by other companies or investors, Adjusted EBITDA does not include share-based compensation charges. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is of limited use in that it does not reflect all of the amounts associated with the Company’s results of operations as determined in accordance with GAAP and does not accurately reflect real cash flow. In addition, other companies may not use Adjusted EBITDA or may use other non-GAAP measures, limiting the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA for purposes of comparison. The Company’s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that the Company will not incur expenses that are the same as or similar to the adjustments in this presentation. Therefore, Adjusted EBITDA should only be used to evaluate the Company’s results of operations in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP measures. The Company compensates for the limitations of Adjusted EBITDA by relying upon GAAP results to gain a complete picture of the Company’s performance. Because Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure, as defined by the SEC, the Company includes in the tables below reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to the most directly comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.

Adjusted EBITDA is a component of two restrictive financial covenants for the Company’s unsecured Credit Facility, Series B Senior Notes and Series C Senior Notes (as defined and more fully described under the heading “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources”). These instruments contain financial covenants requiring the Company to not: • Permit the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Credit Facility and the Note Purchase Agreement (as defined and more fully described under the heading “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Liquidity and Capital Resources” in this MD&A)) of Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Facility and the Note Purchase Agreement) to fixed charges as of the end of any fiscal quarter to be less than 2.50 to 1. At December 31, 2018, the actual ratio was 4.11 to 1. • Permit the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of funded debt (as defined in the Credit Facility and the Note Purchase Agreement) to Adjusted EBITDA at any time during any period of four consecutive quarters to be greater than 2.75 to 1. At December 31, 2018, the actual ratio was 1.47 to 1. At December 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with each of these aforementioned covenants. There are no anticipated trends that the Company is aware of that would indicate non-compliance with these covenants, though, significant deterioration in our financial performance could impact the Company's ability to comply with these covenants. -33- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company’s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including those set forth in this section as well as those discussed under Part I, “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this document. This discussion should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes thereto set forth in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.” Results of Operations General The Company, incorporated in 1979, is a leading rental provider of relocatable modular buildings for classroom and office space, electronic test equipment for general purpose and communications needs, and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes. The Company’s primary emphasis is on equipment rentals. The Company is comprised of four reportable business segments: (1) its modular building and portable storage container rental segment (“Mobile Modular”); (2) its electronic test equipment rental segment (“TRS-RenTelco”); (3) its containment solutions for the storage of hazardous and non-hazardous liquids and solids segment (“Adler Tanks”); and (4) its classroom manufacturing segment selling modular buildings used primarily as classrooms in California (“Enviroplex”). In 2018, Mobile Modular, TRS-RenTelco, Adler Tanks and Enviroplex contributed 53%, 28%, 14% and 5%, respectively, of the Company’s income before provision for taxes (the equivalent of “pre-tax income”), compared to 50%, 31%, 13% and 6%, respectively, for 2017. Although managed as a separate business segment, Enviroplex’s revenues, pre-tax income contribution and total assets are not significant relative to the Company’s consolidated financial position. The Company generates its revenues primarily from the rental of its equipment on operating leases with sales of equipment occurring in the normal course of business. The Company requires significant capital outlay to purchase its rental inventory and recovers its investment through rental and sales revenues. Rental revenue and certain other service revenues negotiated as part of the lease agreements with customers and related costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the lease. Sales revenue and related costs are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment to the customers. Sales revenues are less predictable and can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer demands and requirements. Generally, rental revenues less cash operating costs recover the equipment’s capitalized cost in a shorter period of time relative to the equipment’s potential rental life and when sold, sale proceeds are usually above its net book value. The Company’s rental operations include rental and rental related services revenues which comprised approximately 81% of the Company’s total revenues in 2018 and for the three years ended December 31, 2018. Over the past three years, modulars, electronic test equipment and tanks and boxes comprised approximately 53%, 24% and 24%, respectively, of the cumulative rental operations revenues. The Company’s direct costs of rental operations include depreciation of rental equipment, rental related service costs, impairment of rental equipment, and other direct costs of rental operations (which include direct labor, supplies, repairs, insurance, property taxes, license fees and amortization of certain lease costs). The Company sells modular, electronic test equipment and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes that are new, or previously rented. The Company’s Enviroplex subsidiary manufactures and sells modular classrooms. The renting and selling of some modular equipment requires a dealer’s license, which the Company has obtained from the appropriate governmental agencies. Sales and other revenues of modulars, electronic test equipment and tanks and boxes have comprised approximately 19% of the Company’s consolidated revenues in 2018 and for the three years ended December 31, 2018. Over the past three years, modulars, electronic test equipment and tanks and boxes comprised approximately 71%, 27% and 2% of sales and other revenues, respectively. The Company’s cost of sales includes the carrying value of the equipment sold and the direct costs associated with the equipment sold such as delivery, installation, modifications and related site work. The rental and sale of modulars to public school districts comprised 24%, 26% and 23% of the Company’s consolidated rental and sales revenues for 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. (For more information, see “Item 1. Business – Relocatable Modular Buildings – Classroom Rentals and Sales to Public Schools (K-12)” above.) Selling and administrative expenses primarily include personnel and benefit costs, which includes share-based compensation, depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, bad debt expense, advertising costs, and professional service fees. The Company believes that sharing of common facilities, financing, senior management, and operating and accounting systems by all of the Company’s operations, results in an efficient use of overhead. Historically, the Company’s operating margins have been impacted favorably to the extent its costs and expenses are leveraged over a large installed customer base. However, there can be no assurance as to the Company’s ability to maintain a large installed customer base or ability to sustain its historical operating margins. -34- Recent Developments In February 2019, the Company announced that its board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.375 per common share for the quarter ending March 31, 2019, an increase of 10% over the prior year’s comparable quarter. Percentage of Revenue Table The following table sets forth for the periods indicated the results of operations as a percentage of the Company’s total revenues and the percentage of changes in the amount of such of items as compared to the amount in the indicated prior period: Percent of Total Revenues Percent Change Three Years Year Ended December 31, 2018 over 2017 over 2018–2016 2018 2017 2016 2017 2016 Revenues Rental 64 % 64 % 63 % 64 % 10 % 7 % Rental related services 17 17 17 18 6 3 Rental operations 81 81 80 82 9 6 Sales 19 19 20 18 1 23 Other — — — — 32 26 Total revenues 100 100 100 100 8 9 Costs and expenses Direct costs of rental operations Depreciation of rental equipment 16 15 15 17 5 (3 ) Rental related services 13 13 13 13 7 6 Other 14 14 14 15 5 4 Total direct costs of rental operations 43 42 42 45 5 2 Cost of sales 12 11 13 12 (2) 24 Total costs 55 53 55 57 4 7 Gross profit 45 47 45 43 13 12 Selling and administrative expenses 24 23 24 24 4 6 Income from operations 21 24 21 19 24 20 Other income (expense): Interest expense 3 3 3 3 6 (5 ) Foreign currency exchange gain (loss) — — — — nm nm Income before (benefit) provision for income taxes 18 21 18 16 25 25 Provision (benefit) for income taxes (1 ) 5 (15 ) 7 nm nm Net income 20 % 16 % 33 % 9 % (49) % nm nm = not meaningful -35- Twelve Months Ended December 31, 201 8 Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 Overview Consolidated revenues in 2018 increased 8%, to $498.3 million from $462.0 million in 2017. Consolidated net income in 2018 decreased to $79.4 million, or $3.24 per diluted share in 2018, compared to $153.9 million, or $6.34 per diluted share, in 2017. 2017 results included an increase to net income of $102.5 million, or $4.23 per diluted share, due to the tax benefit associated with the enactment by the U.S. government of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 on December 22, 2017 (the “Tax Act”), which is discussed below. The Company’s year over year total revenue increase was primarily due to higher rental and rental related services revenues as more fully described below. For 2018 compared to 2017, on a consolidated basis: • Gross profit increased $26.9 million, or 13%, to $233.3 million. Mobile Modular’s gross profit increased $16.8 million, or 16%, due to higher gross profit on rental, sales and rental related services revenues. Adler Tanks’ gross profit increased $4.8 million, or 11%, due to higher gross profit on rental revenues, partly offset by lower gross profit on sales and rental related services revenues. TRS-RenTelco’s gross profit increased $4.5 million, or 9%, due to higher gross profit on rental and sales revenues. Enviroplex’s gross profit increased $0.8 million, or 9%, primarily due to higher gross margin on sales revenues. • Selling and administrative expenses increased $4.2 million, or 4%, to $115.8 million, primarily due to increased salaries and employee benefit costs across all divisions. • Interest expense increased $0.7 million, or 6%, to $12.3 million, primarily due to 11% higher net average interest rate, partly offset by 5% lower average debt levels of the Company. • Pre-tax income contribution was 53%, 28% and 14% by Mobile Modular, TRS-RenTelco and Adler Tanks, respectively, in 2018, compared to 50%, 31% and 13%, respectively, in 2017. These results are discussed on a segment basis below. Pre-tax income contribution by Enviroplex was 5% and 6% in 2018 and 2017, respectively. • The Tax Act, among other things, reduced the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, and required a one-time mandatory repatriation of foreign earnings. As a result of the Tax Act, the Company re-measured its net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a net benefit of $102.8 million. In addition, a one-time transition income tax estimated at $0.3 million related to repatriation of foreign earnings was recorded. The provision for income taxes resulted in a tax benefit of 84.4% in 2017 compared to a tax provision of 24.2% in 2018. The tax benefit in 2017 was primarily due to the $102.5 million net impact of the Tax Act. In addition, in 2018 the Company benefited from the recording of $2.0 million excess tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation as a reduction to the provision for income taxes compared to $0.9 million in 2017. These tax benefits, or shortfalls, were recorded in equity prior to 2017. • Adjusted EBITDA increased $24.8 million, or 14%, to $203.1 million compared to $178.3 million in 2017. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization, non-cash impairment costs and share-based compensation.

For the year ended December 31, 201 8 compared to the year ended December 31, 201 7 : • Gross Profit on Rental Revenues – Rental revenues increased $16.6 million, or 12%, compared to 2017, due to 3% higher average rental equipment on rent and 8% higher average monthly rental rates. As a percentage of rental revenues, depreciation was 13% in 2018 compared to 15% in 2017 and other direct costs were 27% in 2018 and 29% in 2017, which resulted in gross margin percentage of 60% in 2018 compared to 56% in 2017. Other direct costs in 2017 included a $1.6 million impairment of rental assets, deemed beyond economic repair in the Southern California region. The higher rental revenues and higher rental margins resulted in gross profit on rental revenues increasing 19%, to $95.1 million from $80.0 million in 2017. • Gross Profit on Rental Related Services – Rental related services revenues increased $4.2 million, or 8%, compared to 2017. Most of these service revenues are negotiated with the initial lease and are recognized on a straight-line basis with the associated costs over the initial term of the lease. The increase in rental related services revenues was primarily attributable to higher repair revenue and increased services performed during the lease. The higher revenues, partly offset by lower gross margin percentage of 24% in 2018 compared to 25% in 2017 resulted in rental related services gross profit increasing 2%, to $13.0 million from $12.7 million in 2017. • Gross Profit on Sales – Sales revenues increased $2.0 million, or 5%, compared to 2017. Gross profit on sales increased $1.0 million, or 9%, due to higher used equipment sales revenues and higher gross margins of 29% in 2018 compared to 28% in 2017. Sales occur routinely as a normal part of Mobile Modular’s rental business; however, these sales can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer requirements, equipment availability and funding. For 2018, Mobile Modular’s selling and administrative expenses increased $2.4 million, or 4%, to $58.0 million, primarily due to increased employee salaries and benefit costs and higher allocated corporate expenses. -38- TRS-RenTelco For 2018, TRS-RenTelco’s total revenues increased $10.6 million, or 10%, to $118.7 million compared to 2017, primarily due to higher rental and sales revenues. Pre-tax income increased $2.6 million, or 10%, to $28.8 million for 2018, primarily due to higher gross profit on rental and sales revenues, partly offset by foreign currency exchange loss in 2018 and higher selling and administrative expenses.

The lower gross margin percentage of 55% in 2018, compared to 57% in 2017 was primarily due to lower gross margin on new and used equipment sales. The higher sales revenues, partly offset by lower gross margin, resulted in gross profit on sales increasing 9%, to $12.6 million from $11.6 million in 2017. Sales occur routinely as a normal part of TRS-RenTelco’s rental business; however, these sales and related gross margins can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer requirements, equipment availability and funding. For 2018, TRS-RenTelco’s selling and administrative expenses increased $0.7 million, or 3%, to $22.8 million, primarily due to higher salaries and employee benefit costs and higher allocated corporate expenses. -40- Adler Tanks For 2018, Adler Tanks’ total revenues increased $4.7 million, or 5%, to $96.1 million compared to 2017, primarily due to higher rental revenues, partly offset by lower sales revenues during 2018.

As a percentage of rental revenues, depreciation was 23% and 25% in 2018 and 2017, respectively, and other direct costs were 16% and 17% in 2018 and 2017, respectively, which resulted in gross margin percentages of 61% in 2018 compared to 59% in 2017. The higher rental revenues, together with higher rental margins resulted in gross profit on rental revenues increasing $5.0 million, or 13%, to $42.6 million in 2018. • Gross Profit on Rental Related Services – Rental related services revenues increased $0.1 million, or 1%, compared to 2017. Lower gross margin percentage of 20% in 2018 compared to 21% in 2017, partly offset by higher revenue, resulted in rental related services gross profit decreasing $0.1 million, or 1%, to $5.0 million from $5.1 million in 2017. For 2018, Adler Tanks’ selling and administrative expenses increased $0.5 million, or 2% to $30.0 million from $29.5 million in the same period in 2017, primarily due to increased employee headcount, salaries and benefit costs. -42- Twelve Months Ended December 31, 201 7 Compared to Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2016 Overview Consolidated revenues in 2017 increased 9%, to $462.0 million from $424.1 million in 2016. Consolidated net income in 2017 increased to $153.9 million, or $6.34 per diluted share in 2017, compared to $38.3 million, or $1.60 per diluted share, in 2016. 2017 results include an increase to net income of $102.5 million, or $4.23 per diluted share, due to the tax benefit associated with the enactment by the U.S. government of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 on December 22, 2017 (the “Tax Act”), which is discussed below. The Company’s year over year total revenue increase was primarily due to higher rental, sales and rental related services revenues as more fully described below. For 2017 compared to 2016, on a consolidated basis: • Gross profit increased $22.2 million, or 12%, to $206.3 million. Mobile Modular’s gross profit increased $10.1 million, or 11%, due to higher gross profit on rental, sales and rental related services revenues. Adler Tanks’ gross profit increased $5.8 million, or 16%, due to higher gross profit on rental, sales and rental related services revenues. TRS-RenTelco’s gross profit increased $4.5 million, or 10%, due to higher gross profit on rental and sales revenues. Enviroplex’s gross profit increased $1.8 million, or 25%, primarily due to higher sales revenues. • Selling and administrative expenses increased $6.7 million, or 6%, to $111.6 million, primarily due to increased salaries and employee benefit costs and professional fees. • Interest expense decreased $0.6 million, or 5%, to $11.6 million, primarily due to 10% lower average debt levels of the Company, partly offset by 5% higher net average interest rate. • Pre-tax income contribution was 50%, 31% and 13% by Mobile Modular, TRS-RenTelco and Adler Tanks, respectively, in 2017, compared to 53%, 32% and 10%, respectively, in 2016. These results are discussed on a segment basis below.

As a result of the Tax Act, the Company re-measured its net deferred tax liabilities and recognized a net benefit of $102.8 million. In addition, a one-time transition income tax estimated at $0.3 million related to repatriation of foreign earnings was recorded. The provision for income taxes resulted in a tax benefit of 84.4% compared to a tax provision of 42.9% in 2016. The tax benefit in 2017 was primarily due to the $102.5 million net impact of the Tax Act. In addition, the Company benefited from $0.9 million lower re-pricing of state deferred tax liabilities in 2017 compared to 2016 and the adoption of ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, which resulted in the recording of $0.9 million excess tax benefits as a reduction to the provision for income taxes. These tax benefits, or shortfalls, were historically recorded in equity. In addition, in 2016, the decision to exit the Company’s Bangalore, India branch increased the 2016 provision for income taxes by $0.7 million as a valuation allowance was recorded against the related deferred tax assets. • Adjusted EBITDA increased $14.9 million, or 9%, to $178.3 million compared to $163.4 million in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure and is defined as net income before interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation, amortization and share-based compensation.

Most of these service revenues are negotiated with the initial lease and are recognized on a straight-line basis with the associated costs over the initial term of the lease. The increase in rental related services revenues was primarily attributable to higher services performed during the lease, and higher delivery and return delivery at Mobile Modular Portable Storage. The higher revenues and higher gross margin percentage of 25% in 2017 compared to 24% in 2016 resulted in rental related services gross profit increasing 7%, to $12.7 million from $11.8 million in 2016. • Gross Profit on Sales – Sales revenues increased $8.0 million, or 27%, compared to 2016. Gross profit on sales increased $2.6 million, or 34%, due to higher used equipment sales revenues and higher gross margins of 28% in 2017 compared to 26% in 2016. Sales occur routinely as a normal part of Mobile Modular’s rental business; however, these sales can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer requirements, equipment availability and funding. For 2017, Mobile Modular’s selling and administrative expenses increased $4.2 million, or 8%, to $55.6 million from $51.4 million in 2016, primarily due to increased employee headcount, salaries and benefit costs, higher marketing and administrative costs and higher corporate allocated expenses. -45- TRS-RenTelco For 2017, TRS-RenTelco’s total revenues decreased $0.6 million, or 1%, to $108.0 million compared to 2016, primarily due to lower sales revenues, partly offset by higher rental revenues. Pre-tax income increased $4.8 million, or 23%, to $26.1 million for 2017, primarily due to higher gross profit on rental and sales revenues and foreign currency exchange gain, partly offset by higher selling and administrative expenses. The following table summarizes year-to-year results for each revenue and gross profit category, income from operations, pre-tax income, and other selected information.

For the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016: • Gross Profit on Rental Revenues – Rental revenues increased $0.5 million, or 1%, to $82.8 million with depreciation expense decreasing $2.4 million, or 7%, and other direct costs decreasing $0.8 million, or 6%, resulting in an increase in gross profit on rental revenues of $3.7 million, or 11%, to $36.4 million in 2017. As a percentage of rental revenues, depreciation was 40% in 2017 compared to 43% in 2016 and other direct costs was 16% in 2017 compared to 17% in 2016, which resulted in gross margin percentage of 44% in 2017 compared to 40% in 2016. The rental revenues increase was due to 3% higher average rental equipment on rent, partly offset by 2% lower average monthly rental rates. • Gross Profit on Sales – Sales revenues decreased $1.2 million, or 6%, compared to 2016. The higher gross margin percentage of 57% in 2017, compared to 51% in 2016 was primarily due to higher gross margin on used equipment sales. The higher gross margin was partly offset by lower sales revenues, which resulted in gross profit on sales increasing 5%, to $11.6 million from $11.0 million in 2016. Sales occur routinely as a normal part of TRS-RenTelco’s rental business; however, these sales and related gross margins can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer requirements, equipment availability and funding. For 2017, TRS-RenTelco’s selling and administrative expenses increased $0.3 million, or 1%, to $22.2 million from $21.9 million in 2016, primarily due to higher salaries and employee benefit costs, partly offset by lower allocated corporate expenses. -47- Adler Tanks For 2017, Adler Tanks’ total revenues increased $7.5 million, or 9%, to $91.4 million compared to 2016, primarily due to higher rental and sales revenues during 2017. The revenue increase together with higher gross profit on rental, sales and rental related services revenues, partly offset by higher selling and administrative expenses, resulted in a pre-tax income increase of $4.0 million, or 61%, to $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. The following table summarizes year-to-year results for each revenue and gross profit category, income from operations, pre-tax income and other selected information.

For the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to year ended December 31, 2016: • Gross Profit on Rental Revenues – Rental revenues increased $5.4 million, or 9%, due to 12% higher average rental equipment on rent, partly offset by 2% lower average rental rates in 2017 as compared to 2016. As a percentage of rental revenues, depreciation was 25% and 27% in 2017 and 2016, respectively, and other direct costs were 17% in 2017 and 2016, which resulted in gross margin percentages of 59% in 2017 compared to 56% in 2016. The higher rental revenues, together with higher rental margins resulted in gross profit on rental revenues increasing $5.1 million, or 16%, to $37.6 million in 2017. • Gross Profit on Rental Related Services – Rental related services revenues increased $1.0 million, or 4%, compared to 2016. The higher revenues and higher gross margin percentage of 21% in 2017 compared to 20% in 2016, resulted in rental related services gross profit increasing $0.3 million, or 6%, to $5.1 million from $4.8 million in 2016. For 2017, Adler Tanks’ selling and administrative expenses increased $1.9 million, to $29.5 million from $27.6 million in the same period in 2016, primarily due to increased employee headcount, salaries and benefit costs and higher corporate allocated expenses. -49- Liquidity and Capital Resources The Company’s rental businesses are capital intensive and generate significant cash flows. Cash flows for the Company in 2018 as compared to 2017 are summarized as follows: Cash Flows from Operating Activities: The Company’s operations provided net cash flow of $142.7 million for 2018 as compared to $122.4 million in 2017. The 17% increase was primarily attributable to improved operating profit, higher decrease in accounts receivable, lower increase in prepaid expenses and other assets, an increase in deferred income and other balance sheet changes. Cash Flows from Investing Activities: Net cash used in investing activities was $104.5 million for 2018 as compared to $70.9 million in 2017. The $33.6 million increase was primarily due to $28.5 million higher purchases of rental equipment of $123.1 million in 2018, compared to $94.6 million in 2017, $7.5 million cash payment for the acquisition of business assets, $1.0 million higher purchases of property, plant and equipment, partly offset by higher proceeds from sales of used rental equipment. Cash Flows from Financing Activities: Net cash used in financing activities was $39.1 million in 2018 as compared to $49.9 million in 2017. The $10.8 million decrease was primarily due to $18.0 million higher net borrowings under the Company’s bank lines of credit, partly offset by $6.0 million higher payment of dividends. Significant capital expenditures are required to maintain and grow the Company’s rental assets. During the last three years, the Company has financed its working capital and capital expenditure requirements through cash flow from operations, proceeds from the sale of rental equipment and from bank borrowings and notes offerings. Sales occur routinely as a normal part of the Company’s rental businesses. However, these sales can fluctuate from period to period depending on customer requirements and funding. Although the net proceeds received from sales may fluctuate from period to period, the Company believes its liquidity will not be adversely impacted from lower sales in any given year because it believes it has the ability to increase its bank borrowings, offer additional notes and conserve its cash in the future by reducing the amount of cash it uses to purchase rental equipment, pay dividends, or repurchase the Company’s common stock. As the following table indicates, cash flow provided by operating activities and proceeds from sales of used rental equipment have been greater than rental equipment purchases over the past three years. Funding of Rental Asset Growth (amounts in thousands) Year Ended December 31, Three Year 2018 2017 2016 Totals Cash provided by operating activities $ 142,667 $ 122,389 $ 140,695 $ 405,751 Proceeds from sales of used rental equipment 41,786 38,344 29,406 109,536 Cash available for purchase of rental equipment 184,453 160,733 170,101 515,287 Purchases of rental equipment (123,071 ) (94,579 ) (79,038 ) (296,688 ) Cash paid for acquisition of business assets (7,543 ) — — (7,543 ) Cash available for other uses $ 53,839 $ 66,154 $ 91,063 $ 211,056 In addition to increasing its rental assets, the Company had other capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment of $15.7 million in 2018, $14.6 million in 2017 and $10.5 million in 2016, and has used cash to provide returns to its shareholders in the form of cash dividends. The Company paid cash dividends of $30.9 million, $24.9 million and $24.4 million in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company has in the past made repurchases of shares of its common stock from time to time in the over-the-counter market (NASDAQ) and/or through privately negotiated, block transactions under an authorization from the Board of Directors. Shares repurchased by the Company are canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued stock. There were no repurchases of common stock during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. As of February 25, 2019, 1,592,026 shares remain authorized for repurchase. Unsecured Revolving Lines of Credit In March 2016, the Company renewed its credit agreement with a syndicate of banks (the “Credit Facility”). The five-year facility matures on March 31, 2021 and replaced the Company’s prior $420.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility. The Credit Facility provides for a $420.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (which may be increased to $620.0 million with $200.0 -50- million of additional commitments), which includes a $25.0 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a $10.0 million sublimit for swingline loans. In March 2016, the Company entered into a Credit Facility Letter Agreement and a Credit Line Note in favor of MUFG Union Bank, N.A., extending its line of credit facility related to its cash management services (“Sweep Service Facility”) and increasing the facility size from $10.0 million to $12.0 million. The Sweep Service Facility matures on the earlier of March 31, 2021, or the date the Company ceases to utilize MUFG Union Bank, N.A. for its cash management services. At December 31, 2018, under the Credit Facility and Sweep Service Facility, the Company had unsecured lines of credit that permit it to borrow up to $432.0 million of which $198.6 million was outstanding, and had capacity to borrow up to an additional $233.4 million. The Credit Facility contains financial covenants requiring the Company to not (all defined terms used below not otherwise defined herein have the meaning assigned to such terms in the Amended Credit Facility): • Permit the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges as of the end of any fiscal quarter to be less than 2.50 to 1. At December 31, 2018, the actual ratio was 4.11 to 1. • Permit the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of funded debt to EBITDA at any time during any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters to be greater than 2.75 to 1. At December 31, 2018, the actual ratio was 1.47 to 1. • Permit Tangible Net Worth as of the end of any fiscal quarter of the Company to be less than the sum of (i) $246.1 million plus (ii) 25% of the Company’s Consolidated Net Income (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility) (but only if a positive number) for each fiscal quarter ended subsequent to December 31, 2011 plus (iii) 90% of the net cash proceeds from the issuance of the Company’s capital stock after December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2018, such sum was $366.8 million and the actual Tangible Net Worth of the Company was $536.5 million. At December 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with each of the aforementioned covenants. There are no anticipated trends that the Company is aware of that would indicate non-compliance with these covenants, although significant deterioration in our financial performance could impact the Company’s ability to comply with these covenants. 4.03% Senior Notes Due in 2018 On April 21, 2011, the Company entered into a Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement (the “Note Purchase Agreement”) with Prudential Investment Management, Inc. (“PIM”), The Prudential Insurance Company of America and Prudential Retirement Insurance and Annuity Company (collectively, the “Purchaser”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell an aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million of its 4.03% Series A Senior Notes (the “Series A Senior Notes”) to the Purchaser. The Series A Senior Notes were an unsecured obligation of the Company, due on April 21, 2018. Interest on these notes was due semi-annually in arrears and the principal was due in five equal annual installments, with the first payment due on April 21, 2014. In addition, the Note Purchase Agreement allowed for the issuance and sale of additional senior notes to the Purchaser (the “Shelf Notes”) in the aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million, to mature no more than 12 years after the date of original issuance thereof, to have an average life of no more than 10 years and to bear interest on the unpaid balance. The final $20.0 million principal payment under the Series A Senior Notes was made in April 2018 with no amount remaining outstanding as of December 31, 2018. 3.68% Senior Notes Due in 2021 On March 17, 2014, the Company issued and sold to the Purchasers a $40.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.68% Series B Senior Notes (the “Series B Senior Notes”) pursuant to the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement, as amended. The Series B Senior Notes are an unsecured obligation of the Company and bear interest at a rate of 3.68% per annum and mature on March 17, 2021. Interest on the Series B Senior Notes is payable semi-annually beginning on September 17, 2014 and continuing thereafter on March 17 and September 17 of each year until maturity. The principal balance is due when the notes mature in 2021. The full net proceeds from the Series B Senior Notes were used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2018, the principal balance outstanding under the Series B Senior Notes was $40.0 million. 3.84% Senior Notes Due in 2022 On November 5, 2015, the Company issued and sold to the Purchasers a $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.84% Series C Senior Notes (the “Series C Senior Notes”) pursuant to the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement, as amended. The Series C Senior Notes are an unsecured obligation of the Company and bear interest at a rate of 3.84% per annum and mature on November 5, 2022. Interest on the Series C Senior Notes is payable semi-annually beginning on May 5, 2016 and continuing thereafter on November 5 and May 5 of each year until maturity. The principal balance is due when the notes mature in 2022. The full net -51- proceeds from the Series C Senior Notes were used to reduce the outstanding balance on the Company’s revolving credit line. At December 31, 201 8 , the principal balance outstanding under the Series C Senior Notes was $60.0 million. Among other restrictions, the Note Purchase Agreement, under which the Series A Senior Notes, Series B Senior Notes and Series C Senior Notes were sold, contains financial covenants requiring the Company to not (all defined terms used below not otherwise defined herein have the meaning assigned to such terms in the Note Purchase Agreement): • Permit the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of EBITDA (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) to fixed charges as of the end of any fiscal quarter to be less than 2.50 to 1. At December 31, 2018, the actual ratio was 4.11 to 1. • Permit the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of funded debt to EBITDA (as defined in the Note Purchase Agreement) at any time during any period of four consecutive quarters to be greater than 2.75 to 1. At December 31, 2018, the actual ratio was 1.47 to 1. • Permit tangible net worth, calculated as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, to be less than the sum of (i) $229.0 million, plus (ii) 25% of net income for such fiscal quarter subsequent to December 31, 2010, plus (iii) 90% of the net cash proceeds from the issuance of the Company’s capital stock after December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2018, such sum was $366.8 million and the actual tangible net worth of the Company was $536.5 million. At December 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with each of the aforementioned covenants. There are no anticipated trends that the Company is aware of that would indicate non-compliance with these covenants, although significant deterioration in our financial performance could impact the Company’s ability to comply with these covenants. On February 9, 2016, the Company entered into an amendment to the Note Purchase Agreement (“2016 Amendment”) with the Purchaser. Pursuant to the 2016 Amendment, (i) the issuance period for the shelf notes to be issued and sold pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement is extended until the earlier of February 9, 2019 or the termination of the issuance and sale of the shelf notes upon the 30 days’ prior notice of either PIM or the Company, and (ii) the definition of the “Available Facility Amount,” which is the aggregate amount of the shelf notes that may be authorized for purchase pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement was amended to equal a formula based on: $250 million, minus the aggregate principal amount of the shelf notes then outstanding and purchased pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, minus the shelf notes accepted by the Company for purchase, but not yet purchased, by the Purchaser pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement; provided, however, the aggregate amount of the shelf notes purchased by any corporation or other entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, PIM shall not exceed $200 million. Although no assurance can be given, the Company believes it will continue to be able to negotiate general bank lines of credit and issue senior notes adequate to meet capital requirements not otherwise met by operational cash flows and proceeds from sales of rental equipment. Contractual Obligations and Commitments At December 31, 2018, the Company’s material contractual obligations and commitments consisted of outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities expiring in 2021, outstanding amounts under our 3.68% and 3.84% senior notes due in 2021 and 2022, respectively, and operating leases for facilities. The operating lease amounts exclude property taxes and insurance. The table below provides a summary of the Company’s contractual obligations and reflects expected payments due as of December 31, 2018 and does not reflect changes that could arise after that date.

Critical Accounting Policies In response to the SEC’s Release No. 33-8040, “Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies,” the Company has identified the most critical accounting policies upon which its financial status depends. The Company determined its critical accounting policies by considering those policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments. The Company has identified that its most critical accounting policies are those related to revenue recognition, depreciation, maintenance, repair and refurbishment, impairment of rental equipment and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets. Descriptions of these accounting policies are found in both the notes to the consolidated financial statements and at relevant sections in this Management’s Discussion and Analysis. Revenue recognition: Lease revenue - Rental revenues from operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease for all operating segments. Rental billings for periods extending beyond period end are recorded as deferred income and are recognized in the period earned. Rental related services revenues are primarily associated with relocatable modular building and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes leases. For modular building leases, rental related services revenues for modifications, delivery, installation, dismantle and return delivery are lease related because the payments are considered minimum lease payments that are an integral part of the negotiated lease agreement with the customer. These revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain leases are accounted for as sales-type leases. For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment. Other revenues include interest income on sales-type leases and rental income on facility leases. Non-lease revenue - Sales revenue is recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment to customers. Certain leases are accounted for as sales-type leases. For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment. The Company typically recognizes non-lease related revenues at a point in time because the customer does not simultaneously consume the benefits of the Company’s promised goods and services, or performance obligations, and obtain control when delivery and installation are complete. For contracts that have multiple performance obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in the contract based on the Company’s best estimate of the standalone selling prices of each distinct performance obligation in the contract. The standalone selling price is typically determined based upon the expected cost plus an estimated margin of each performance obligation. Depreciation - The estimated useful lives and estimated residual values used for rental equipment are based on the Company’s experience as to the economic useful life and sale value of its products. Additionally, to the extent information is publicly available, the Company also compares its depreciation policies to other companies with similar rental products for reasonableness. The lives and residual values of rental equipment are subject to periodic evaluation. For modular equipment, external factors to consider may include, but are not limited to, changes in legislation, regulations, building codes, local permitting, and supply or demand. Internal factors for modulars may include, but are not limited to, change in equipment specifications, condition of equipment, or maintenance policies. For electronic test equipment, external factors to consider may include, but are not limited to, technological advances, changes in manufacturers’ selling prices, and supply or demand. Internal factors for electronic test equipment may include, but are not limited to, change in equipment specifications, condition of equipment or maintenance policies. For liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes, external factors to consider may include, but are not limited to, changes in Federal and State legislation, the types of materials stored and the frequency of movements and uses. Internal factors for liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes may include, but are not limited to, change in equipment specifications and maintenance policies. Changes in useful lives or residual values will impact depreciation expense and any gain or loss from the sale of used equipment. Depending on the magnitude of such changes, the impact on the financial statements could be significant. Maintenance, repair and refurbishment - Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The direct material and labor costs of value-added additions or major refurbishment of modular buildings are capitalized to the extent the refurbishment significantly improves the quality and adds value or life to the equipment. Judgment is involved as to when these costs should be capitalized. The Company’s policies narrowly limit the capitalization of value-added items to specific additions such as restrooms, sidewalls and ventilation upgrades. In addition, only major refurbishment costs incurred near the end of the estimated useful life of the rental equipment, which extend its useful life, and are subject to certain limitations, are capitalized. Changes in these policies could impact the Company’s financial results. -53- Impairment of rental equipment - The carrying value of the Company’s rental equipment is its capitalized cost less accumulated depreciation. To the extent events or circumstances i ndicate that the carrying value cannot be recovered, an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carrying value to fair value. The Company determines fair value based upon the condition of the equipment and the projected net cash flows from its rental and sale considering current market conditions. Additionally, if the Company decides to sell or otherwise dispose of the rental equipment, it is carried at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell or dispose. Due to uncertainties inherent in t he valuation process and market conditions, it is reasonably possible that actual results of operating and disposing of rental equipment could be materially different than current expectations. Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets - The Company assesses the carrying amount of its recorded goodwill and intangible assets annually or in interim periods if circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred. The impairment review is performed by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. The two-step process requires management to make certain judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation. The first step in the evaluation consists of estimating the fair value of the reporting unit based on discounted cash flows using revenue and after tax profit estimates. Management then compares its estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit with the reporting unit’s carrying amount, which includes goodwill and intangible assets. If the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, then goodwill and intangible assets are not impaired and no further testing is required. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit were to exceed its fair value, then the second step is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill and intangible assets and an impairment loss is recorded for an amount equal to the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the goodwill and intangible assets. Impact of Inflation Although the Company cannot precisely determine the effect of inflation, from time to time it has experienced increases in costs of rental equipment, manufacturing costs, operating expenses and interest. Because a majority of its rentals are relatively short-term, the Company has generally been able to pass on such increased costs through increases in rental rates and selling prices, but there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to pass on increased costs to customers in the future. Off Balance Sheet Transactions As of December 31, 2018, the Company did not have any “off-balance-sheet arrangements,” as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of Regulation S-K. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. The Company is exposed to cash flow and fair value risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to its 3.68% and 3.84% senior notes due in 2021 and 2022, respectively, and its revolving lines of credit. Weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve at December 31, 2018. The estimate of fair value of the Company’s fixed rate debt is based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for bank loans with similar terms and average maturities. The table below presents principal cash flows by expected annual maturities, related weighted average interest rates and estimated fair value for the Company’s Series B and Series C Senior Notes and the Company’s revolving lines of credit under the Credit Facility and Sweep Service Facility as of December 31, 2018.

The Company commenced the closure of its Indian operations during 2017. The Canadian operations of the Company subject it to foreign currency risks (i.e. the possibility that the financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates). Currently, the Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge its economic exposure with respect to assets, liabilities and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies. In 2018, the Company experienced minimal impact on net income due to foreign -54- exchange rate fluctuations. Although there can be no assurances, given the size of the Canadian operations, the Company does not expect future foreign excha nge gains and losses to be significant. The Company has no derivative financial instruments that expose the Company to significant market risk. -55- ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA.

The consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles and include amounts based on management’s estimates and judgments. All other financial information in this report has been presented on a basis consistent with the information included in the financial statements. The Company’s management is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company maintains a system of internal control that is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliable preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements, as well as to safeguard assets from unauthorized use or disposition. The Company’s system of internal control over financial reporting is embodied in the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics. It sets the tone of our organization and includes factors such as integrity and ethical values. Our internal control over financial reporting is supported by formal policies and procedures, which are reviewed, modified and improved as changes occur in business conditions and operations. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies and procedures may deteriorate. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed solely of outside directors, meets periodically with members of management and the independent auditors to review and discuss internal control over financial reporting, as well as accounting and financial reporting matters. The independent auditors report to the Audit Committee and accordingly have full and free access to the Audit Committee at any time. The Company’s management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 based on the criteria set forth in the 2013 Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on its evaluation, management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2018, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria. -57- Report of Independent Regist ered Public Accounting Firm Board of Directors and Shareholders McGrath RentCorp: Opinion on internal control over financial reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of McGrath RentCorp (a California corporation) and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in the 2013 Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”).

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES Organization McGrath RentCorp and its wholly-owned subsidiaries (the “Company”) is a California corporation organized in 1979. The Company is a diversified business to business rental company with four rental divisions; relocatable modular buildings, portable storage containers, electronic test equipment and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes. Although the Company’s primary emphasis is on equipment rentals, sales of equipment occur in the normal course of business. The Company is comprised of four reportable business segments: modular building and portable storage segment (“Mobile Modular”), electronic test equipment segment (“TRS-RenTelco”), containment solutions for the storage of hazardous and non-hazardous liquids and solids segment (“Adler Tanks”) and classroom manufacturing division selling modular classrooms in California (“Enviroplex”). Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of McGrath RentCorp and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. Revenue Recognition Lease revenues - Rental revenues from operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease for all operating segments. Rental billings for periods extending beyond period end are recorded as deferred income and are recognized in the period earned. Rental related services revenues are primarily associated with relocatable modular building and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes leases. For modular building leases, rental related services revenues for modifications, delivery, installation, dismantle and return delivery are lease related because the payments are considered minimum lease payments that are an integral part of the negotiated lease agreement with the customer. These revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain leases are accounted for as sales-type leases. For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment. Other revenues include interest income on sales-type leases and rental income on facility leases. Non-lease revenues - Sales revenue is recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment to customers. Certain leases are accounted for as sales-type leases. For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment. Other revenue is recognized when earned and primarily includes interest income on sales-type leases, rental income on facility leases and certain logistics services. Sales taxes charged to customers are reported on a net basis and are excluded from revenues and expenses. Depreciation of Rental Equipment Rental equipment is depreciated on a straight-line basis for financial reporting purposes and on an accelerated basis for income tax purposes. The costs of major refurbishment of relocatable modular buildings, portable storage containers and tanks and boxes are capitalized to the extent the refurbishment significantly adds value to, or extends the life of the equipment. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. The estimated useful lives and residual values of the Company’s rental equipment used for financial reporting purposes are as follows: Relocatable modular buildings 18 years, 50% residual value Relocatable modular accessories 3 to 18 years, no residual value Blast resistant modules 20 years, no residual value Portable storage containers 25 years, 62.5% residual value Electronic test equipment and accessories 1 to 8 years, no residual value Liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes and accessories 3 to 20 years, no residual value -65- Costs of Rental Related Services Costs of rental related services are primarily associated with relocatable modular building leases and liquid and solid containment tank and boxes. Modular building leases primarily consist of costs for services to be provided under the negotiated lease agreement for delivery, installation, modifications, skirting, additional site-related work, and dismantle and return delivery. Costs related to these services are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Costs of rental related services associated with liquid and solid containment solutions consists of costs of delivery, removal and cleaning of the tanks and boxes. These costs are recognized in the period the service is performed. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets The Company evaluates the carrying value of rental equipment and identifiable definite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances have occurred that would indicate the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. A key element in determining the recoverability of long-lived assets is the Company’s outlook as to the future market conditions for its rental equipment. If the carrying amount is not fully recoverable, an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the carrying amount to fair value. The Company determines fair value based upon the condition of the rental equipment and the projected net cash flows from its rental and sale considering current market conditions. Goodwill and identifiable indefinite lived assets are evaluated for potential impairment annually or when circumstances indicate potential impairment may have occurred. Impairment losses, if any, are determined based upon the excess of carrying value over the estimated fair value of the asset. The Company recorded an impairment of modular rental equipment of $0.1 million and $1.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. There were no impairments of long-lived assets during the year ended December 31, 2016. Other Direct Costs of Rental Operations Other direct costs of rental operations include direct labor, supplies, repairs, insurance, property taxes, license fees, impairment of rental equipment and certain modular lease costs charged to customers in the negotiated rental rate, which are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Cost of Sales Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income includes the carrying value of the equipment sold and all direct costs associated with the sale. Warranty Reserves Sales of new relocatable modular buildings, portable storage containers, electronic test equipment and related accessories and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes not manufactured by the Company are typically covered by warranties provided by the manufacturer of the products sold. The Company typically provides limited 90-day warranties for certain sales of used rental equipment and one-year warranties on equipment manufactured by Enviroplex. Although the Company’s policy is to provide reserves for warranties when required for specific circumstances, the Company has not found it necessary to establish such reserves to date as warranty costs have not been significant. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis for financial reporting purposes, and on an accelerated basis for income tax purposes. Depreciation expense for property, plant and equipment is included in “Selling and administrative expenses” and “Rental related services” in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. -66- Property, plant and equipment consist of the following: (dollar amounts in thousands) Estimated useful life December 31, in years 2018 2017 Land Indefinite $ 50,689 $ 50,689 Land improvements 20 – 50 50,064 43,337 Buildings 30 29,359 26,862 Furniture, office and computer equipment 3 – 10 33,081 32,118 Vehicles and machinery 5 – 25 38,199 34,597 201,392 187,603 Less accumulated depreciation (77,118 ) (70,034 ) 124,274 117,569 Construction in progress 2,625 1,601 $ 126,899 $ 119,170 Property, plant and equipment depreciation expense was $8.0 million, $7.6 million and $8.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Construction in progress at December 31, 2018 and 2017 consisted primarily of costs related to acquisition of land and land improvements and information technology upgrades. Capitalized Software Costs The Company capitalizes certain development costs incurred in connection with its internal use software. Costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as incurred. Once an application has reached the development stage, direct internal and external costs are capitalized until the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use. These costs generally include external direct costs of materials and services consumed in the project and internal costs, such as payroll and benefits of those employees directly associated with the development of the software. Maintenance, training and post implementation costs are expensed as incurred. The Company also capitalizes costs related to specific upgrades and enhancements when it is probable the expenditures will result in additional functionality. Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and equipment. The Company capitalized $0.1 million and $0.8 million in internal use software during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Advertising Costs Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Total advertising expenses were $3.2 million, $2.9 million and $2.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for using an asset and liability approach. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the effect of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are adjusted to the extent necessary to reflect tax rates expected to be in effect when temporary differences reverse. Adjustments may be required to deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities due to changes in tax laws and audit adjustments by tax authorities. A valuation allowance would be established if, based on the weight of available evidence, management believes that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a recorded deferred tax asset would not be realized in future periods. To the extent adjustments are required in any given period, the adjustments would be included within the “Provision for income taxes” in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Goodwill and Intangible Assets Purchase prices of acquired businesses have been allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based on the estimated fair values on the respective acquisition dates. Based on these values, the excess purchase prices over the fair value of the net assets acquired were allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets. Intangible assets related to customer relationships are amortized over eleven years. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, goodwill and trade name intangible assets which have indefinite lives totaled $33.7 million. The Company assesses potential impairment of its goodwill and intangible assets when there is evidence that events or circumstances have occurred that would indicate the recovery of an asset’s carrying value is unlikely. The Company also assesses -67- potential impairment of its goodwill and intangible assets on an annual basis regardless of whether there is evidence of impairment. If indicators of impairment were to be present in intangible assets used in operations and future discounted cash flows were not expected to be sufficient to recover the assets’ carrying amount, an impairment loss would be charged to expense in the period identified. The amount of an impairment loss would be recognized as the e xcess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value. Factors the Company considers important, which may cause impairment include, among others, significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired asset, negative industry or economic trends, and s ignificant underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results. The impairment review of the Company’s goodwill and indefinite lived assets is performed by first assessing qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two-step goodwill impairment test. In the first step, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value to determine if the goodwill and intangible assets are impaired. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, then goodwill and intangible assets are not impaired and no further testing is required. If the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit were to exceed its fair value, then the second step is performed in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill and intangible assets and an impairment loss is recorded for an amount equal to the difference between the implied fair value and the carrying value of the goodwill and intangible assets. The Company conducted its annual impairment analysis in the fourth quarter of its fiscal year. The impairment analysis did not result in an impairment charge for the fiscal years ended 2018, 2017 or 2016. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The Company based its fair value estimates on assumptions that it believes are reasonable but are uncertain and subject to changes in market conditions. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed as net income divided by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Diluted EPS is computed assuming conversion of all potentially dilutive securities including the dilutive effects of stock options, unvested restricted stock awards and other potentially dilutive securities. The table below presents the weighted-average common stock used to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share: (in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Weighted-average common stock for calculating basic earnings per share 24,141 23,999 23,900 Effect of potentially dilutive securities from equity-based compensation 399 270 76 Weighted-average common stock for calculating diluted earnings per share 24,540 24,269 23,976 The following securities were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share as their effect would have been anti-dilutive: (in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Options to purchase common stock — 7 661 In May 2008, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase an aggregate of 2,000,000 shares of the Company's outstanding common stock. The Company has in the past made purchases of shares of its common stock from time to time in over-the-counter market (NASDAQ) transactions, through privately negotiated, large block transactions and through a share repurchase plan, in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In August 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase an additional 2,000,000 shares of the Company's outstanding common stock. The amount and time of the specific repurchases are subject to prevailing market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors, including management’s discretion. All shares repurchased by the Company are canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares of common stock. There can be no assurance that any authorized shares will be repurchased and the repurchase program may be modified, extended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. There were no repurchases of common stock during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. As of December 31, 2018, 1,592,026 shares remain authorized for repurchase. -68- Accounts Receivable and Concentration of Credit Risk The Company’s accounts receivable consist of amounts due from customers for rentals, sales, financed sales and unbilled amounts for the portion of modular building end-of-lease services earned, which were negotiated as part of the lease agreement. Unbilled receivables related to end-of-lease services, which consists of dismantle and return delivery of buildings, were $32.3 million at December 31, 2018 and $30.1 million at December 31, 2017. The Company sells primarily on 30-day terms, individually performs credit evaluation procedures on its customers on each transaction and will require security deposits from its customers when a significant credit risk is identified. The Company records an allowance for doubtful accounts in amounts equal to the estimated losses expected to be incurred in the collection of the accounts receivable. The estimated losses are based on historical collection experience in conjunction with an evaluation of the current status of the existing accounts. Customer accounts are written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when an account is determined to be uncollectable. The allowance for doubtful accounts activity was as follows: (in thousands) 2018 2017 Beginning balance, January 1 $ 1,920 $ 2,087 Provision for doubtful accounts 581 1,480 Write-offs, net of recoveries (618 ) (1,647 ) Ending balance, December 31 $ 1,883 $ 1,920 Financial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of trade accounts receivable. From time to time, the Company maintains cash balances in excess of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation limits. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The Company believes that the carrying amounts for cash, accounts receivable, accounts payable and notes payable approximate their fair values except for fixed rate debt included in notes payable which has an estimated fair value of $99.0 million and $120.2 million compared to the recorded value of $100.0 million and $120.0 million as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The estimates of fair value of the Company’s fixed rate debt are based on the borrowing rates currently available to the Company for bank loans with similar terms and average maturities. Foreign Currency Transactions and Translation The Company's Canadian subsidiary, TRS-RenTelco Inc., a British Columbia corporation (“TRS-Canada”), functions as a branch sales office for TRS-RenTelco in Canada. The functional currency for TRS-Canada is the U.S. dollar. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses of TRS-Canada are reported in the results of operations in the period in which they occur. The Company’s Indian subsidiary, TRS-RenTelco India Private Limited (“TRS-India”), functioned as a rental and sales office for TRS-RenTelco in India, which commenced its closure during 2017. The functional currency for TRS-India is the Indian Rupee. All assets and liabilities of TRS-India are translated into U.S. dollars at period-end exchange rates and all income statement amounts are translated at the average exchange rate for each month within the year. Currently, the Company does not use derivative instruments to hedge its economic exposure with respect to assets, liabilities and firm commitments as the foreign currency transactions and risks to date have not been significant. Share-Based Compensation The Company measures and recognizes the compensation expense for all share-based awards made to employees and directors, including stock options, stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) and restricted stock units (“RSUs”), based upon estimated fair values. The fair value of stock options and SARs is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and for RSUs based upon the fair market value of the underlying shares of common stock as of the date of grant. The Company recognizes share-based compensation cost ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which generally equals the vesting period. For performance-based RSUs, compensation costs are recognized when vesting conditions are met. In addition, the Company estimates the probable number of shares of common stock that will be earned and the corresponding compensation cost until the achievement of the performance goal is known. The Company records share-based compensation costs in “Selling and administrative expenses” in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The Company recognizes a benefit from share-based compensation in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity if an incremental tax benefit is realized. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in “Note 6 –Benefit Plans”. -69- Use of Estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions in determining reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each period presented. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The most significant estimates included in the financial statements are the future cash flows and fair values used to determine the recoverability of the rental equipment and identifiable definite lived intangible assets carrying value, the various assets’ useful lives and residual values, and the allowance for doubtful accounts. New Accounting Pronouncements In March 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard Update (“ASU”) No. 2016-02, Leases (Subtopic 842-10). Under the new guidance, lessees will be required to recognize the following for all leases (with the exception of short-term leases) on the commencement date: a) lease liability, which is a lessee’s obligation to make lease payments arising from a lease, measured on a discounted basis; and b) right-of-use asset, which is an asset that represents the lessee’s right to use, or control the use of, a specified asset for the lease term. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company leases real estate for some of its branch offices and rental equipment storage yards, and leases vehicles and equipment used in its rental operations. The Company anticipates the new lessee accounting will increase its total assets and liabilities by approximately $10 million based upon the present value of lease payments over the expected lease term using interest rates explicit in the lease, or the Company’s estimated incremental borrowing rate if not stated in the lease. We will use the transition method that allows us to initially apply this guidance at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative–effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption, which we believe will not be significant. Consequently, historical financial information will not be updated and the financial disclosures requirement under the new standard will not be provided for periods prior to January 1, 2019. The new guidance contains additional optional transition practical expedients intended to simplify adoption. The Company will use the package of expedients that allows for not reassessing: (1) whether any expired or existing contracts are or contain leases, (2) the lease classification for any expired or existing leases and (3) initial direct costs for any expired or existing leases. The Company has implemented processes and systems to assist in the ongoing lease data collection, analysis and accounting for leases in accordance with the new guidance. A majority of the Company’s revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 were accounted for under the current lease accounting guidance under Topic 840 (see Note 2. Implemented Accounting Pronouncements - Revenue from Contracts with Customers for further discussion). In December 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-20, Leases (Topic 842): Narrow-Scope Improvements for Lessors, which is expected to reduce a lessor’s implementation and ongoing costs associated with applying the new leases standard. The ASU also clarifies a specific lessor accounting requirement. Specifically, this ASU addresses the following issues facing lessors when applying the leases standard: Sales taxes and other similar taxes collected from lessees, certain lessor costs paid directly by lessees and recognition of variable payments for contracts with lease and non-lease components. Under the new guidance, lessor accounting is largely unchanged and the Company has concluded that no significant changes are expected to the accounting for revenues upon adoption of Topic 842. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Customer’s Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement That Is a Service Contract. Under this ASU, entities should account for costs associated with implementing a cloud computing arrangement that is considered a service contract to follow the guidance in Subtopic 350-40 to determine which implementation costs to capitalize as an asset related to the service contract and which costs to expense. The amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company expects to early adopt this guidance in 2019, which is not expected to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements. NOTE 2. IMPLEMENTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS Revenue from Contracts with Customers The Company’s accounting for revenues is governed by two accounting standards. The majority of the Company’s revenues are considered lease or lease related and are accounted for in accordance with Topic 840, Leases. Revenues determined to be non-lease related are accounted for in accordance with ASU No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), which was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2018. The Company utilized the modified retrospective method of adoption and there was no impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements, nor was there a cumulative effect of initially applying the new standard. The Company accounts for revenues when approval and commitment from both parties have been obtained, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. The Company typically recognizes non-lease related revenues at a point in time because the customer does not simultaneously consume the benefits of the Company’s promised goods and services, or performance obligations, and obtain control when delivery -70- and installation are complete. For contracts that have multiple performa nce obligations, the transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation in the contract based on the Company’s best estimate of the standalone selling prices of each distinct performance obligation in the contract. The standalone selling price is typically determined based upon the expected cost plus an estimated margin of each performance obligation. The Company generally rents and sells to customers on 30 day payment terms. The Company does not typically offer variable payment terms, or accept non-monetary consideration. Amounts billed and due from the Company’s customers are classified as Accounts receivable on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet. For certain sales of modular buildings, progress payments from the customer are received during the manufacturing of new equipment, or the preparation of used equipment. The advance payments are not considered a significant financing component because the payments are used to meet working capital needs during the contract and to protect the Company from the customer failing to adequately complete their obligations under the contract. These contract liabilities are included in Deferred income on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet and totaled $15.7 million and $6.8 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Sales revenues totaling $5.8 million were recognized during the year ended December 31, 2018, which were included in the contract liability balance at December 31, 2017. For certain modular building sales, the customer retains a small portion of the contract price until full completion of the contract, which results in revenue earned in excess of billings. These unbilled contract assets are included in Accounts receivable on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet and totaled $1.4 million and $2.0 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Lease Revenues Rental revenues from operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease for all operating segments. Rental billings for periods extending beyond period end are recorded as deferred income and are recognized in the period earned. Rental related services revenues are primarily associated with relocatable modular building and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes leases. For modular building leases, rental related services revenues for modifications, delivery, installation, dismantle and return delivery are lease related because the payments are considered minimum lease payments that are an integral part of the negotiated lease agreement with the customer. These revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Certain leases are accounted for as sales-type leases. For these leases, sales revenue and the related accounts receivable are recognized upon delivery and installation of the equipment and the unearned interest is recognized over the lease term on a basis which results in a constant rate of return on the unrecovered lease investment. Other revenues include interest income on sales-type leases and rental income on facility leases. Non-Lease Revenues Non-lease revenues are recognized in the period when control of the performance obligation is transferred, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services. For liquid and solid containment solutions, portable storage containers and electronic test equipment, rental related services revenues for delivery and return delivery are considered non-lease revenues. Sales revenues are typically recognized at a point in time, which occurs upon the completion of delivery, installation and acceptance of the equipment by the customer. Accounting for non-lease revenues requires judgment in determining the point in time the customer gains control of the equipment and the appropriate accounting period to recognize revenue. Sales taxes charged to customers are reported on a net basis and are excluded from revenues and expenses. The following table disaggregates the Company’s revenues by lease (within the scope of Topic 840) and non-lease revenues (within the scope of Topic 606) and the underlying service provided for the three years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016: -71- (in thousands) Mobile Modular TRS- RenTelco Adler Tanks Enviroplex Consolidated Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2018 Leasing $ 200,214 $ 94,345 $ 70,653 $ — $ 365,212 Non-lease: Rental related services 14,870 2,607 24,276 — 41,753 Sales 39,467 19,895 1,044 29,046 89,452 Other 23 1,810 80 — 1,913 Total non-lease 54,360 24,312 25,400 29,046 133,118 Total revenues $ 254,574 $ 118,657 $ 96,053 $ 29,046 $ 498,330 2017 Leasing $ 180,612 $ 85,930 $ 64,676 $ — $ 331,218 Non-lease: Rental related services 13,331 2,358 24,322 — 40,011 Sales 37,434 18,137 2,362 31,369 89,302 Other (111 ) 1,619 (5 ) — 1,503 Total non-lease 50,654 22,114 26,679 31,369 130,816 Total revenues $ 231,266 $ 108,044 $ 91,355 $ 31,369 $ 462,034 2016 Leasing $ 168,787 $ 87,085 $ 59,217 $ — $ 315,089 Non-lease: Rental related services 11,326 2,292 23,292 — 36,910 Sales 29,393 17,675 1,314 22,121 70,503 Other 6 1,565 7 — 1,578 Total non-lease 40,725 21,532 24,613 22,121 108,991 Total revenues $ 209,512 $ 108,617 $ 83,830 $ 22,121 $ 424,080 Customer returns of rental equipment prior to the end of the rental contract term are typically billed a cancellation fee, which is recorded as rental revenue in the period billed. Sales of new relocatable modular buildings, portable storage containers, electronic test equipment and related accessories and liquid and solid containment tanks and boxes not manufactured by the Company are typically covered by warranties provided by the manufacturer of the products sold. The Company typically provides limited 90-day warranties for certain sales of used rental equipment and one-year warranties on equipment manufactured by Enviroplex. Although the Company’s policy is to provide reserves for warranties when required for specific circumstances, the Company has not found it necessary to establish such reserves to date as warranty costs have not been significant. The Company’s incremental cost of obtaining lease contracts, which consists of salesperson commissions, are deferred and amortized over the initial lease term for modular building leases. Incremental costs for obtaining a contract for all other operating segments are expensed in the period incurred because the lease term is typically less than 12 months. NOTE 3. FINANCED LEASE RECEIVABLES The Company has entered into sales-type leases to finance certain equipment sales to customers. The lease agreements have a bargain purchase option at the end of the lease term. The minimum lease payments receivable and the net investment included in accounts receivable for such leases are as follows: (in thousands) December 31, 2018 2017 Gross minimum lease payments receivable $ 2,419 $ 2,150 Less – unearned interest (249 ) (201 ) Net investment in sales type lease receivables $ 2,170 $ 1,949 -72- As of December 31, 201 8 , the future minimum lease payments under non-cancelable sales-type leases to be received in 201 9 and thereafter are as follows: (in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2019 $ 1,765 2020 419 2021 157 2022 78 Total minimum future lease payments $ 2,419 NOTE 4.

The five-year facility matures on March 31, 2021 and replaced the Company’s prior $420.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility. The Credit Facility provides for a $420.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility (which may be increased to $620.0 million with $200.0 million of additional commitments), which includes a $25.0 million sublimit for the issuance of standby letters of credit and a $10.0 million sublimit for swingline loans. In March 2016, the Company entered into a Credit Facility Letter Agreement and a Credit Line Note in favor of MUFG Union Bank, N.A., extending its line of credit facility related to its cash management services (“Sweep Service Facility”) and increasing the facility size from $10.0 million to $12.0 million. The Sweep Service Facility matures on the earlier of March 31, 2021, or the date the Company ceases to utilize MUFG Union Bank, N.A. for its cash management services. -73- At December 31, 201 7 , under the Credit Facility and Sweep Service Facility, the Company had unsecured lines of credit that permit it to borrow up to $432.0 million of which $ 198.6 million was outstanding, and had capacity to borrow up to an additional $ 233.4 million. The Amended Credit Facility contains financial covenants requiring the Company to not (all defined terms used below not otherwise defined herein have the meaning assi gned to such terms in the Amended Credit Facility): • Permit the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges as of the end of any fiscal quarter to be less than 2.50 to 1. At December 31, 2018, the actual ratio was 4.11 to 1. • Permit the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of funded debt to EBITDA at any time during any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters to be greater than 2.75 to 1. At December 31, 2018, the actual ratio was 1.47 to 1. • Permit Tangible Net Worth as of the end of any fiscal quarter of the Company to be less than the sum of (i) $246.1 million plus (ii) 25% of the Company’s Consolidated Net Income (as defined in the Amended Credit Facility) (but only if a positive number) for each fiscal quarter ended subsequent to December 31, 2011 plus (iii) 90% of the net cash proceeds from the issuance of the Company’s capital stock after December 31, 2011. At December 31, 2018, such sum was $366.8 million and the actual Tangible Net Worth of the Company was $536.5 million. Amounts borrowed under the Credit Facility bear interest at the Company’s option at either: (i) LIBOR plus a defined margin, or (ii) the Agent bank’s prime rate (“base rate”) plus a margin. The applicable margin for each type of loan is measured based upon the Consolidated Leverage Ratio at the end of the prior fiscal quarter and ranges from 1.00% to 1.75% for LIBOR loans and 0% to 0.75% for base rate loans. In addition, the Company pays an unused commitment fee for the portion of the $420.0 million credit facility that is not used. These fees are based upon the Consolidated Leverage Ratio and range from 0.15% to 0.30%. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, the applicable margins were 1.25% for LIBOR based loans, 0.25% for base rate loans and 0.20% for unused fees. Amounts borrowed under the Sweep Service Facility are based upon the MUFG Union Bank, N.A. base rate plus an applicable margin and an unused commitment fee for the portion of the $12.0 million facility not used. The applicable base rate margin and unused commitment fee rates for the Sweep Service Facility are the same as for the Amended Credit Facility. The following information relates to the lines of credit for each of the following periods: (dollar amounts in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 Maximum amount outstanding $ 228,500 $ 215,732 Average amount outstanding $ 204,534 $ 199,499 Weighted average interest rate, during the period 3.36 % 2.64 % Prime interest rate, end of period 5.50 % 4.50 % 4.03% Senior Notes Due in 2018 On April 21, 2011, the Company entered into a Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement (the “Note Purchase Agreement”) with Prudential Investment Management, Inc. (“PIM”), The Prudential Insurance Company of America and Prudential Retirement Insurance and Annuity Company (collectively, the “Purchaser”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to sell an aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million of its 4.03% Series A Senior Notes (the “Series A Senior Notes”) to the Purchaser. The Series A Senior Notes were an unsecured obligation of the Company, due on April 21, 2018. Interest on these notes was due semi-annually in arrears and the principal was due in five equal annual installments, with the first payment due on April 21, 2014. In addition, the Note Purchase Agreement allowed for the issuance and sale of additional senior notes to the Purchaser (the “Shelf Notes”) in the aggregate principal amount of $100.0 million, to mature no more than 12 years after the date of original issuance thereof, to have an average life of no more than 10 years and to bear interest on the unpaid balance. The final $20.0 million principal payment under the Series A Senior Notes was made in April 2018 with no amount remaining outstanding as of December 31, 2018. At December 31, 2017, the principal balance outstanding under the Series A Senior Notes was $20 million. 3.68% Senior Notes Due in 2021 On March 17, 2014, the Company issued and sold to the Purchasers a $40.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.68% Series B Senior Notes (the “Series B Senior Notes”) pursuant to the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement, as amended. The Series B Senior Notes are an unsecured obligation of the Company, bear interest at a rate of 3.68% per annum and mature on March 17, 2021. Interest on the Series B Senior Notes is payable semi-annually beginning on September 17, 2014 and continuing thereafter on March 17 and September 17 of each year until maturity. The principal balance is due when the notes mature in 2021. The full net proceeds from the Series B Senior Notes were used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the principal balance outstanding under the Series B Senior Notes was $40.0 million. -74- 3.84% Senior Notes Due in 2022 On November 5, 2015, the Company issued and sold to the Purchasers a $60.0 million aggregate principal amount of its 3.84% Series C Senior Notes (the “Series C Senior Notes”) pursuant to the terms of the Note Purchase Agreement, as amended. The Series C Senior Notes are an unsecured obligation of the Company, bear interest at a rate of 3.84% per annum and mature on November 5, 2022. Interest on the Series C Senior Notes is payable semi-annually beginning on May 5, 2016 and continuing thereafter on November 5 and May 5 of each year until maturity. The principal balance is due when the notes mature in 2022. The full net proceeds from the Series C Senior Notes were used to reduce the outstanding balance on the Company’s revolving credit line. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, the principal balance outstanding under the Series C Senior Notes was $60.0 million. Among other restrictions, the Note Purchase Agreement, under which the Series A Senior Notes, Series B Senior Notes and Series C Senior Notes were sold, contains financial covenants requiring the Company to not (all defined terms used below not otherwise defined herein have the meaning assigned to such terms in the Note Purchase Agreement): • Permit the Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of EBITDA to fixed charges as of the end of any fiscal quarter to be less than 2.50 to 1. At December 31, 2018, the actual ratio was 4.11 to 1. • Permit the Consolidated Leverage Ratio of funded debt to EBITDA at any time during any period of four consecutive quarters to be greater than 2.75 to 1. At December 31, 2018, the actual ratio was 1.47 to 1. • Permit Tangible Net Worth, calculated as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, to be less than the sum of (i) $229.0 million, plus (ii) 25% of net income for such fiscal quarter subsequent to December 31, 2010, plus (iii) 90% of the net cash proceeds from the issuance of the Company’s capital stock after December 31, 2010. At December 31, 2018, such sum was $366.8 million and the actual Tangible Net Worth of the Company was $536.5 million. At December 31, 2018, the Company was in compliance with each of the aforementioned covenants. There are no anticipated trends that the Company is aware of that would indicate non-compliance with these covenants, though, significant deterioration in the Company’s financial performance could impact its ability to comply with these covenants. On February 9, 2016, the Company entered into an amendment to the Note Purchase Agreement (“2016 Amendment”) with the Purchaser. Pursuant to the 2016 Amendment, (i) the issuance period for the shelf notes to be issued and sold pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement is extended until the earlier of February 9, 2019 or the termination of the issuance and sale of the shelf notes upon the 30 days’ prior notice of either PIM or the Company, and (ii) the definition of the “Available Facility Amount,” which is the aggregate amount of the shelf notes that may be authorized for purchase pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement was amended to equal a formula based on: $250 million, minus the aggregate principal amount of the shelf notes then outstanding and purchased pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement, minus the shelf notes accepted by the Company for purchase, but not yet purchased, by the Purchaser pursuant to the Note Purchase Agreement; provided, however, the aggregate amount of the shelf notes purchased by any corporation or other entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, PIM shall not exceed $200 million.

Among other provisions, the Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% in 2018, required companies to pay a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax deferred and created new taxes on certain foreign-source earnings. As of December 31, 2018, the Company completed its accounting for the tax effects of enactment of the Tax Act without any material adjustments to its previous estimate of the one-time transition tax. As of December 31, 2018 the Company does not have a deferred tax liability related to its foreign earnings because it does not currently have any specific plans to repatriate funds from its international subsidiaries. The Company may do so in the future if a dividend can be remitted with no material tax impact. -76- In December 2016, the Company decided to exit the Bangalore, India branch operations of its TRS-RenTelco electronics division. The wind down of operations in India beg a n in 2017. As a re sult, a valuation allowance was recorded against the deferred tax assets that resulted primarily from accumulated net operating loss carry fo rwards in India as of December 31, 201 8 that management estimate d the benefit of which will not be realized. As of December 31, 201 8 , the Company’s foreign net operating losses for tax purposes were $ 0. 6 million. If not realized, these carry forwards wil l begin to expire in 2023. For income tax purposes, deductible compensation related to share-based awards is based on the value of the award when realized, which may be different than the compensation expense recognized by the company for financial statement purposes which is based on the award value on the date of grant. The difference between the value of the award upon grant, and the value of the award when ultimately realized, creates either additional tax expense or benefit. In 2018 and 2017, exercise of share-based awards by employees resulted in an excess tax benefit of $2.0 million and $0.9 million, respectively. In 2016 share-based awards by employees resulted in a tax shortfall of $1.1 million, which was recorded to equity. The Company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit. For tax positions meeting the more-likely-than-not threshold, the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority. The Company evaluated all of its tax positions for which the statute of limitations remained open and determined there were no material unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2018 and 2017. In addition, there have been no material changes in unrecognized benefits during 2018, 2017 and 2016. The Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, and various states and foreign jurisdictions. Tax regulations within each jurisdiction are subject to interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and require the application of significant judgment. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state and local, or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for the years before 2014. Our income tax returns are subject to examination by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. There may be differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations, and as a result, disputes may arise with these tax authorities involving the timing and amount of deductions and allocation of income. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the provision (benefit) for income taxes in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income for all periods presented. Such interest and penalties were not significant for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. NOTE 6. BENEFIT PLANS Stock Plans The Company adopted the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan (the “2016 Plan”), effective June 8, 2016, under which 2,000,000 shares of the common stock of the Company, plus the number of shares that remain available for grants of awards under the Company's 2007 Stock Option Plan (the “2007 Plan”) and become available as a result of forfeiture, termination, or expiration of awards previously granted under the 2007 Plan, were reserved for the grant of equity awards to its employees, directors and consultants. The equity awards have a maximum term of 7 years at an exercise price of not less than 100% of the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the date the equity award is granted. The 2016 Plan replaced the 2007 Plan. The 2016 Plan provides for the grant of awards in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, RSUs, the vesting of which may be performance-based or service-based, and other rights and benefits. Each RSU issued reduces the number of shares of the Company’s common stock available for grant under the 2016 Plan by two shares. There were no modifications to the 2016 Plan and no awards classified as liabilities in the year ended December 31, 2018. For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, the share-based compensation expense was $4.1 million, $3.2 million and $3.1 million, respectively, before provision for income taxes. The Company recorded a tax benefit of approximately $1.1 million, $1.3 million and $1.2 million, respectively, related to the aforementioned share-based compensation expenses. There was no capitalized share-based compensation expense in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Stock Options As of December 31, 2018, a cumulative total of 8,458,600 shares subject to options have been granted with exercise prices ranging from $3.47 to $40.37. Of these, options have been exercised for the purchase of 5,953,688 shares, while options for 1,659,312 shares have been terminated, and options for 845,600 shares with exercise prices ranging from $24.60 to $40.37 remained outstanding -77- under the stock plans. These options vest over five years and expire seven years after grant. To date, no options have been issued to any of the Company’s non-e mployee advisors. As of December 31, 201 8 , 1,962,804 shares remained available for issuance of awards under the stock plans. A summary of the Company’s option activity and related information for the three years ended December 31, 2018 is as follows: Number of options Weighted- average price Weighted- average remaining contractual term (in years) Aggregate intrinsic value (in millions) Balance at December 31, 2015 1,410,650 $ 29.91 Options granted 881,800 25.26 Options exercised (368,085 ) 27.34 Options cancelled/forfeited/expired (339,930 ) 28.62 Balance at December 31, 2016 1,584,435 28.14 Options granted 299,600 34.66 Options exercised (398,275 ) 28.94 Options cancelled/forfeited/expired (276,900 ) 28.04 Balance at December 31, 2017 1,208,860 28.14 Options granted — — Options exercised (332,810 ) 29.49 Options cancelled/forfeited/expired (30,450 ) 28.27 Balance at December 31, 2018 845,600 $ 29.57 4.18 $ 18.6 Exercisable at December 31, 2018 303,225 $ 29.71 3.78 $ 6.6 Expected to vest after December 31, 2018 517,884 $ 29.50 4.41 $ 11.4 The intrinsic value of stock options at any point in time is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the underlying awards and the quoted price of the Company’s common stock. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised and sold under the Company’s stock option plans was $10.6 million, $6.2 million and $4.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively, determined as of the date of option exercise. As of December 31, 2018, there was approximately $2.6 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested share-based compensation option arrangements granted under the Company’s stock plans, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years. The following table indicates the options outstanding and options exercisable by exercise price with the weighted-average remaining contractual life for the options outstanding and the weighted-average exercise price at December 31, 2018: Options Outstanding Options Exercisable Exercise price Number outstanding at December 31, 2018 Weighted- average remaining contractual life (Years) Weighted- average grant date value Number exercisable at December 31, 2018 Weighted- average grant date value $20 – 25 349,990 4.17 $ 24.60 109,150 $ 24.60 $25 – 30 33,970 2.19 $ 27.99 24,460 $ 29.10 $30 – 35 448,300 4.32 $ 33.31 165,675 $ 33.03 $35 – 40 7,900 4.58 $ 38.83 3,600 $ 38.56 $40 – 45 5,440 5.67 $ 40.37 340 $ 40.37 $20 – 45 845,600 4.18 $ 29.57 303,225 $ 29.71 The Company utilizes the Black-Scholes option-pricing model to estimate the fair value of share-based compensation at the date of grant, which requires the use of accounting judgment and financial estimates, including estimates of the expected term option holders will retain their vested stock options before exercising them, the estimated volatility of the Company’s stock price over the expected term and the expected number of options that will be forfeited prior to the completion of their vesting requirements. Application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different estimates of the fair value of share-based compensation amounts recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income. -78- The fair value of each option granted was estimated on t he date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model using the following weighted-average assumptions: Year Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Expected term (in years) — 5.0 5.0 Expected volatility — 26.1 % 28.7 % Expected dividend yields — 3.0 % 4.1 % Risk-free interest rates — 2.0 % 1.2 % The Company monitors option exercise behavior to determine the appropriate homogenous groups for estimation purposes. The Company’s option activity is separated into two categories: directors and employees. The expected term of the options represents the estimated period of time until exercise and is based on historical experience, giving consideration to the option terms, vesting schedules and expectations of future behavior. Expected stock volatility was based on historical stock price volatility of the Company and the risk-free interest rates were based on U.S. Treasury yields in effect on the date of the option grant for the estimated period the options will be outstanding. The expected dividend yield was based upon the current dividend annualized as a percentage of the grant exercise price. No options were granted in 2018. The weighted average grant date fair value per share was $6.28 and $4.14 during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Restricted Stock Units The following table summarizes the activity of the Company’s RSUs, which includes service-based and performance-based awards, for the three years ended December 31, 2018: Weighted- Aggregate average intrinsic Number grant date value of shares fair value (in millions) Balance at December 31, 2015 220,648 $ 30.70 RSUs granted 31,900 25.75 RSUs vested (59,008 ) 29.69 RSUs cancelled/forfeited/expired (68,300 ) 29.33 Balance at December 31, 2016 125,240 30.66 RSUs granted 70,960 34.53 RSUs vested (36,336 ) 26.99 RSUs cancelled/forfeited/expired (66,200 ) 32.63 Balance at December 31, 2017 93,664 33.62 RSUs granted 97,260 49.47 RSUs vested (30,214 ) 33.16 RSUs cancelled/forfeited/expired (21,200 ) 33.88 Balance at December 31, 2018 139,510 $ 44.73 $ 7.2 Performance-based RSUs issued prior to 2018 vest over five years, with 60% of the shares immediately vesting after three years when the performance criteria has been determined to have been met and 20% of the remaining shares vesting annually at the anniversary of the performance determination date, subject to continuous employment of the participant. The 2018 performance-based RSU grants vest after three years with 100% of the shares vesting immediately when performance criteria has been determined to have been met. There were 130,730 performance-based RSUs expected to vest as of December 31, 2018. Service-based RSUs issued to the Company’s directors generally vest over twelve to fourteen months. Service–based RSUs issued to the Company’s management vest over three years. There were 48,710 service-based RSUs expected to vest as of December 31, 2018. No forfeitures are currently expected. The total fair value of RSUs that vested during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 based on the weighted average grant date values was $1.0 million, $1.0 million and $1.8 million, respectively. Share-based compensation expense for RSUs for the year ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was $2.6 million, $1.4 million and $1.0, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, the total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested RSUs was $5.2 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.6 years. -79- Employee Stock Ownership and 401(k) Plans The McGrath RentCorp Employee Stock Ownership and 401(k) Plan (the “KSOP”) provides that each participant may annually contribute an elected percentage of his or her salary, not to exceed the statutory limit. Each employee who has at least three months of service with the Company and is 21 years or older, is eligible to participate in the KSOP. The Company, at its discretion, may make matching contributions. Contributions are expensed in the year approved by the Board of Directors. Dividends on the Company’s stock held by the KSOP are treated as ordinary dividends and, in accordance with existing tax laws, are deducted by the Company in the year paid. For the year ended December 31, 2018 dividends deducted by the Company were $0.3 million, which resulted in a tax benefit of approximately $0.1 million in 2018. At December 31, 2018, the KSOP held 243,007 shares, or 1% of the Company’s total common shares outstanding. These shares are included in basic and diluted earnings per share calculations. NOTE 7. SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY The Company has in the past made purchases of shares of its common stock from time to time in over-the-counter market (NASDAQ) transactions, through privately negotiated, large block transactions and through a share repurchase plan, in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In August 2015, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized the Company to repurchase 2,000,000 shares of the Company's outstanding common stock. The amount and time of the specific repurchases are subject to prevailing market conditions, applicable legal requirements and other factors, including management’s discretion. All shares repurchased by the Company are canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares of common stock. There can be no assurance that any authorized shares will be repurchased and the repurchase program may be modified, extended or terminated by the board of directors at any time. There were no repurchases of common stock during the twelve months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. As of December 31, 2018, 1,592,026 shares remain authorized for repurchase under this authorization. NOTE 8. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company leases certain facilities under various operating leases. Most of the lease agreements provide the Company with the option of renewing its lease at the end of the lease term, at the fair rental value. In most cases, management expects that in the normal course of business, facility leases will be renewed or replaced by other leases. Minimum payments under these leases, exclusive of property taxes and insurance, are as follows: (in thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2019 $ 2,979 2020 2,111 2021 1,713 2022 1,445 2023 1,089 Thereafter 1,142 $ 10,479 Facility rent expense was $3.5 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016. The Company is involved in various lawsuits and routine claims arising out of the normal course of its business. The Company maintains insurance coverage for its operations and employees with appropriate aggregate, per occurrence and deductible limits as the Company reasonably determines necessary or prudent with current operations and historical experience. The major policies include coverage for property, general liability, auto, directors and officers, health, and workers’ compensation insurances. The Company records a provision for a liability when it believes that it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount. The Company reviews these provisions at least quarterly and adjusts these provisions to reflect the impact of negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice of legal counsel, and updated information. Litigation is inherently unpredictable and is subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond the Company’s control. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility that the ultimate amount of liability not covered by insurance, if any, under any pending litigation and claims, individually or in the aggregate, will have a material adverse effect on the financial position or operating results of the Company. -80- The Company’s health and workers’ compensation plans are self-funded high deductible plans with annual stop-loss ins urance of $ 200 ,000 and $ 3 50,000 per claim, respectively. I nsurance providers are responsible for making claim payments that exceed these amounts on an individual claim basis. In addition, the Company has stop loss insurance that pays for claim payments m ade during a twelve month coverage period that exceeds certain specified thresholds in the aggregate. The Company records an expense when health and workers compensation claim payments are made and accrues for the portion of claims incurred, but not yet p aid at period end. The Company makes these accruals based upon a combination of historical claim payments, loss development experience and actuarial estimates. A high degree of judgment is required in developing the underlying assumptions and the resulti ng amounts to be accrued. In addition, our assumptions will change as the Company’s loss experience develops. All of these factors have the potential for impacting the amounts previously accrued and the Company may be required to increase or decrease the amounts previously accrued. At December 31, 201 8 and 201 7 , accruals for the Company’s health and workers’ compensation high deductible plans were $ 3.0 million and $ 2. 9 million, respectively. NOTE 9. INTANGIBLE ASSETS Intangible assets consist of the following: (dollar amounts in thousands) Estimated useful life December 31, (In years) 2018 2017 Trade name Indefinite $ 5,871 $ 5,700 Customer relationships 11 9,849 9,611 15,720 15,311 Less accumulated amortization (8,466 ) (7,587 ) $ 7,254 $ 7,724 Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their respective useful lives. Amortization expense in each of the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 were $0.9 million. Based on the carrying values at December 31, 2018 and assuming no subsequent impairment of the underlying assets, the annual amortization is expected to be $0.9 million in 2019 and $0.1 million in 2020 through 2025. NOTE 10. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS There were no related party transactions in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, or amounts owed to related parties at such dates. -81- NOTE 1 1 . SEGMENT REPORTING FASB guidelines establish annual and interim reporting standards for an enterprise’s operating segments and related disclosures about its products, services, geographic areas and major customers. In accordance with these guidelines the Company’s four reportable segments are Mobile Modular, TRS-RenTelco, Adler Tanks and Enviroplex. Management focuses on several key measures to evaluate and assess each segment’s performance including rental revenue growth, gross margin, and income before provision for income taxes. Excluding interest expense, allocations of revenue and expense not directly associated with one of these segments are generally allocated to Mobile Modular, TRS-RenTelco and Adler Tanks, based on their pro-rata share of direct revenues.

CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSUR E. None. ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures. The Company’s management under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining “disclosure controls and procedures” (as defined in rules promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) for the Company. Based on their evaluation the CEO and CFO have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2018. Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. During the last quarter of the Company’s fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, there were no changes in the Company’s internal control that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Limitations on the Effectiveness of Controls. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues, if any, within a company have been detected. The Company’s disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and the CEO and CFO have concluded that these controls and procedures are effective at the “reasonable assurance” level. Management’s Assessment of Internal Control. Management’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, is discussed in the Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting included on page 57. The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 has been audited by Grant Thornton LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, and its report is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
