Management believes that, when considered together with reported amounts, these measures are useful to investors and management in understanding our ongoing operations and in the analysis of ongoing operating trends. These measures should be considered in addition to, and not as replacements for, the most comparable GAAP measure. Certain measures presented on a non-GAAP basis represent the impact of adjusting items net of tax. The tax-effect for adjusting items is determined individually and on a case-by-case basis. Other companies may calculate these non-GAAP measures differently, limiting the usefulness of these measures for comparative purposes. Management does not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitations of these non-GAAP financial measures are that they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which expenses and income are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. Investors are urged to review the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate Honeywell’s business.

Management believes that, when considered together with reported amounts, these measures are useful to investors and management in understanding our ongoing operations and in the analysis of ongoing operating trends. These measures should be considered in addition to, and not as replacements for, the most comparable GAAP measure. Certain measures presented on a non-GAAP basis represent the impact of adjusting items net of tax. The tax-effect for adjusting items is determined individually and on a case-by-case basis. Other companies may calculate these non-GAAP measures differently, limiting the usefulness of these measures for comparative purposes. Management does not consider these non-GAAP measures in isolation or as an alternative to financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP. The principal limitations of these non-GAAP financial measures are that they exclude significant expenses and income that are required by GAAP to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements. In addition, they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which expenses and income are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. Investors are urged to review the reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP financial measures and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate Honeywell’s business.

Given the strong momentum across our business, we are raising our full-year financial outlook.” “Starbucks continues to be focused and disciplined in the execution of our three key strategic priorities that we established last year: accelerating growth in the U.S. and China, expanding the global reach of the Starbucks brand through our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestlé, and increasing shareholder returns. With our efforts to streamline the company and elevate the Starbucks brand, we are positioning the company to deliver predictable and sustainable operating results while building an enduring company that creates meaningful long-term value for Starbucks shareholders,” concluded Johnson.

Operating income grew 18% to $1,067.1 million in Q3 FY19 , up from $906.8 million in Q3 FY18 .

Net revenues for the EMEA segment declined 11% from Q3 FY18 to $231.7 million in Q3 FY19 due to the conversion of our France and Netherlands retail businesses to fully licensed operations in Q2 FY19 and the closure of certain company-operated stores, partially offset by 286 net new store openings, or 9% store growth, over the past 12 months. Operating income of $16.6 million in Q3 FY19 declined 43% compared to $29.2 million in Q3 FY18 . Operating margin declined 400 basis points to 7.2% , primarily due to higher restructuring costs associated with the closure of certain company-operated stores, partially offset by the shift in portfolio towards more licensed stores.

The resulting changes, which only affected the ticket component of comparable sales growth for the China market and to a lesser extent the CAP segment, had no impact to previously reported consolidated financial statements or segment results—including total net revenues, operating income and diluted earnings per share—and did not impact comparable transaction growth.

Our non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP G&A, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP EPS exclude the below-listed items and their related tax impacts, as they do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the company's future operating performance or comparisons to the company's past operating performance. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to non-GAAP G&A, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP EPS are general and administrative expenses, operating income, operating margin, effective tax rate and diluted net earnings per share, respectively. Non-GAAP Exclusion Rationale Sale of Tazo brand Management excludes the net gain on the sale of our assets associated with our Tazo brand and associated transaction costs as these items do not reflect future gains, losses, costs or tax benefits and for reasons discussed above. Sale of certain retail operations Management excludes the gains and net loss related to the sale of our Thailand, France, the Netherlands and Brazil retail operations as these items do not reflect future gains, losses or tax impacts for reasons discussed above. Restructuring, impairment and optimization costs Management excludes restructuring charges and business process optimization costs related to strategic shifts in its Teavana, EMEA, U.S., e-commerce and other business units. Additionally, management excludes expenses related to divesting certain lower-margin businesses and assets, such as closure of certain company-operated stores and Switzerland intangible asset impairments. Management excludes these items for reasons discussed above. These expenses are anticipated to be completed within a finite period of time. CAP transaction and integration-related costs Management excludes transaction and integration costs and amortization of the acquired intangible assets for reasons discussed above. Additionally, the majority of these costs will be recognized over a finite period of time. 2018 U.S. stock award Management excludes the incremental stock-based compensation award granted in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 for reasons discussed above. Nestlé transaction-related costs Management excludes the transaction-related costs associated with Nestlé for reasons discussed above. Other tax matters On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into U.S. law. Management excludes the estimated transition tax on undistributed foreign earnings, the impacts of estimated incremental foreign withholding taxes on expected repatriated earnings and the re–measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate for reasons discussed above. Non-GAAP G&A, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP EPS may have limitations as analytical tools. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company's results as reported under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than the company does, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes. - more - 19 STARBUCKS CORPORATION RECONCILIATION OF SELECTED GAAP MEASURES TO NON-GAAP MEASURES (unaudited) ($ in millions) Quarter Ended Consolidated Jun 30, 2019 Jul 1, 2018 Change General and administrative expenses, as reported (GAAP) $ 480.2 $ 485.9 (1.2)% Restructuring, impairment and optimization costs (1) 0.4 (4.9 ) CAP transaction and integration-related items (2) (10.5 ) (19.0 ) 2018 U.S. stock award (3) (14.4 ) (21.7 ) Nestlé transaction-related costs (0.8 ) (7.2 ) Sale of Tazo brand — (0.4 ) Non-GAAP G&A $ 454.9 $ 432.7 5.1% Operating income, as reported (GAAP) $ 1,121.3 $ 1,038.2 8.0% Restructuring, impairment and optimization costs (1) 39.6 21.7 CAP transaction and integration-related items (2) 69.0 75.8 2018 U.S. stock award (3) 14.4 21.7 Nestlé transaction-related costs 2.3 12.1 Sale of Tazo brand — 0.4 Non-GAAP operating income $ 1,246.6 $ 1,169.9 6.6% Operating margin, as reported (GAAP) 16.4 % 16.5 % (10) bps Restructuring, impairment and optimization costs (1) 0.7 0.3 CAP transaction and integration-related items (2) 1.0 1.2 2018 U.S. stock award (3) 0.2 0.3 Nestlé transaction-related costs — 0.2 Sale of Tazo brand — — Non-GAAP operating margin 18.3 % 18.5 % (20) bps Diluted net earnings per share, as reported (GAAP) $ 1.12 $ 0.61 83.6% Gain on sale of certain retail operations (Thailand) (0.49 ) — Restructuring, impairment and optimization costs (1) 0.04 0.02 CAP transaction and integration-related items (2) 0.06 0.05 2018 U.S. stock award (3) 0.01 0.02 Nestlé transaction related costs — 0.01 Other tax matters (4) — (0.01 ) Income tax effect on Non-GAAP adjustments (5) 0.04 (0.08 ) Non-GAAP EPS $ 0.78 $ 0.62 25.8% (1) Represents costs associated with our restructuring efforts, primarily severance, lease termination costs and asset impairments related to certain company-operated store closures, as well as business process optimization costs, largely consulting fees.

GAAP results in fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2018 include items which are excluded from non-GAAP results. Please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP measures to non-GAAP measures at the end of this release for more information. “Starbucks delivered strong operating performance in the third quarter, further demonstrating that our ‘Growth at Scale’ agenda is working,” says Kevin Johnson, president and ceo. “Our two targeted long-term growth markets, the U.S. and China, performed extremely well across a number of measures as a result of our focus on enhancing the customer experience, driving new beverage innovation and accelerating the expansion of our digital customer relationships. Given the strong momentum across our business, we are raising our full-year financial outlook.” “Starbucks continues to be focused and disciplined in the execution of our three key strategic priorities that we established last year: accelerating growth in the U.S. and China, expanding the global reach of the Starbucks brand through our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestlé, and increasing shareholder returns. With our efforts to streamline the company and elevate the Starbucks brand, we are positioning the company to deliver predictable and sustainable operating results while building an enduring company that creates meaningful long-term value for Starbucks shareholders,” concluded Johnson. Q3 Fiscal 2019 Highlights • Global comparable store sales increased 6%, driven by a 3% increase in average ticket and a 3% increase in comparable transactions ◦ Americas comparable store sales increased 7%, driven by a 4% increase in average ticket and a 3% increase in transactions; U.S. comparable store sales increased 7%, with transactions up 3% ◦ China/Asia Pacific comparable store sales increased 5%, driven by a 3% increase in average ticket and a 2% increase in transactions; China comparable store sales increased 6%, with transactions up 2% • The company opened 442 net new stores in Q3, yielding 30,626 stores at the end of the quarter, a 7% increase over the prior year. Nearly one-third of net new store openings were in China and 48% were in other international markets • Consolidated net revenues of $6.8 billion grew 8% over the prior year ◦ Consolidated net revenues grew 11% over the prior year adjusted for unfavorable impacts of approximately 2% from Streamline-driven activities and 1% from foreign currency translation ◦ Streamline-driven activities include the licensing of our CPG and foodservice businesses to Nestlé following the close of the transaction on August 26, 2018, and the conversion of certain international retail operations from company-operated to licensed models • GAAP operating margin, inclusive of restructuring and impairment charges, declined 10 basis points year-over-year to 16.4%, primarily due to partner (employee) investments, largely in the Americas segment, licensing of our CPG and foodservice businesses to Nestlé, product mix and higher inventory reserves, partially offset by sales leverage, cost savings initiatives and the adoption of new revenue recognition accounting for stored value card (SVC) breakage ◦ Non-GAAP operating margin of 18.3% declined 20 basis points compared to the prior year. Excluding a 70-basis point unfavorable impact from Streamline-related activities, non-GAAP operating margin expanded by approximately 50 basis points • GAAP Earnings Per Share of $1.12, up 84% over the prior year - more - 2 ◦ Non-GAAP EPS of $0.78, up 26% over the prior year, inclusive of a $0.03 benefit from discrete income tax items • The company returned $581 million to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends • Starbucks ® Rewards loyalty program grew to 17.2 million active members in the U.S., up 14% year-over-year - more - 3 Q3 Americas Segment Results Quarter Ended Change (%) ($ in millions) Jun 30, 2019 Jul 1, 2018 Comparable Store Sales Growth (1) 7% 1% Change in Transactions 3% (2)% Change in Ticket 4% 4% Store Count 17,845 17,204 4% Revenues $4,671.8 $4,224.0 11% Operating Income $1,067.1 $906.8 18% Operating Margin 22.8% 21.5% 130 bps (1) Includes only Starbucks ® company-operated stores open 13 months or longer. Comparable store sales exclude the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Net revenues for the Americas segment grew 11% over Q3 FY18 to $4.7 billion in Q3 FY19 , primarily driven by 7% growth in comparable store sales and 641 net new store openings, or 4% store growth, over the past 12 months, and the impact of the adoption of new revenue recognition accounting for SVC breakage. Operating income grew 18% to $1,067.1 million in Q3 FY19 , up from $906.8 million in Q3 FY18 . Operating margin of 22.8% expanded 130 basis points, primarily due to sales leverage and cost savings initiatives, partially offset by growth in wages and higher inventory reserves.

Comparable store sales exclude the effect of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.

The conversion of the Thailand retail business from company-operated to fully licensed occurred toward the end of Q3 FY19 and did not have a significant impact on revenue growth. Q3 FY19 operating income of $269.8 million grew 15% over Q3 FY18 operating income of $234.1 million .

Net revenues for the EMEA segment declined 11% from Q3 FY18 to $231.7 million in Q3 FY19 due to the conversion of our France and Netherlands retail businesses to fully licensed operations in Q2 FY19 and the closure of certain company-operated stores, partially offset by 286 net new store openings, or 9% store growth, over the past 12 months. Operating income of $16.6 million in Q3 FY19 declined 43% compared to $29.2 million in Q3 FY18 . Operating margin declined 400 basis points to 7.2% , primarily due to higher restructuring costs associated with the closure of certain company-operated stores, partially offset by the shift in portfolio towards more licensed stores.

The resulting changes, which only affected the ticket component of comparable sales growth for the China market and to a lesser extent the CAP segment, had no impact to previously reported consolidated financial statements or segment results—including total net revenues, operating income and diluted earnings per share—and did not impact comparable transaction growth.

Our non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP G&A, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP EPS exclude the below-listed items and their related tax impacts, as they do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of the company's future operating performance or comparisons to the company's past operating performance. The GAAP measures most directly comparable to non-GAAP G&A, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP EPS are general and administrative expenses, operating income, operating margin, effective tax rate and diluted net earnings per share, respectively. Non-GAAP Exclusion Rationale Sale of Tazo brand Management excludes the net gain on the sale of our assets associated with our Tazo brand and associated transaction costs as these items do not reflect future gains, losses, costs or tax benefits and for reasons discussed above. Sale of certain retail operations Management excludes the gains and net loss related to the sale of our Thailand, France, the Netherlands and Brazil retail operations as these items do not reflect future gains, losses or tax impacts for reasons discussed above. Restructuring, impairment and optimization costs Management excludes restructuring charges and business process optimization costs related to strategic shifts in its Teavana, EMEA, U.S., e-commerce and other business units. Additionally, management excludes expenses related to divesting certain lower-margin businesses and assets, such as closure of certain company-operated stores and Switzerland intangible asset impairments. Management excludes these items for reasons discussed above. These expenses are anticipated to be completed within a finite period of time. CAP transaction and integration-related costs Management excludes transaction and integration costs and amortization of the acquired intangible assets for reasons discussed above. Additionally, the majority of these costs will be recognized over a finite period of time. 2018 U.S. stock award Management excludes the incremental stock-based compensation award granted in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 for reasons discussed above. Nestlé transaction-related costs Management excludes the transaction-related costs associated with Nestlé for reasons discussed above. Other tax matters On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into U.S. law. Management excludes the estimated transition tax on undistributed foreign earnings, the impacts of estimated incremental foreign withholding taxes on expected repatriated earnings and the re–measurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate for reasons discussed above. Non-GAAP G&A, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP EPS may have limitations as analytical tools. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the company's results as reported under GAAP. Other companies may calculate these non-GAAP financial measures differently than the company does, limiting the usefulness of those measures for comparative purposes. - more - 19 STARBUCKS CORPORATION RECONCILIATION OF SELECTED GAAP MEASURES TO NON-GAAP MEASURES (unaudited) ($ in millions) Quarter Ended Consolidated Jun 30, 2019 Jul 1, 2018 Change General and administrative expenses, as reported (GAAP) $ 480.2 $ 485.9 (1.2)% Restructuring, impairment and optimization costs (1) 0.4 (4.9 ) CAP transaction and integration-related items (2) (10.5 ) (19.0 ) 2018 U.S. stock award (3) (14.4 ) (21.7 ) Nestlé transaction-related costs (0.8 ) (7.2 ) Sale of Tazo brand — (0.4 ) Non-GAAP G&A $ 454.9 $ 432.7 5.1% Operating income, as reported (GAAP) $ 1,121.3 $ 1,038.2 8.0% Restructuring, impairment and optimization costs (1) 39.6 21.7 CAP transaction and integration-related items (2) 69.0 75.8 2018 U.S. stock award (3) 14.4 21.7 Nestlé transaction-related costs 2.3 12.1 Sale of Tazo brand — 0.4 Non-GAAP operating income $ 1,246.6 $ 1,169.9 6.6% Operating margin, as reported (GAAP) 16.4 % 16.5 % (10) bps Restructuring, impairment and optimization costs (1) 0.7 0.3 CAP transaction and integration-related items (2) 1.0 1.2 2018 U.S. stock award (3) 0.2 0.3 Nestlé transaction-related costs — 0.2 Sale of Tazo brand — — Non-GAAP operating margin 18.3 % 18.5 % (20) bps Diluted net earnings per share, as reported (GAAP) $ 1.12 $ 0.61 83.6% Gain on sale of certain retail operations (Thailand) (0.49 ) — Restructuring, impairment and optimization costs (1) 0.04 0.02 CAP transaction and integration-related items (2) 0.06 0.05 2018 U.S. stock award (3) 0.01 0.02 Nestlé transaction related costs — 0.01 Other tax matters (4) — (0.01 ) Income tax effect on Non-GAAP adjustments (5) 0.04 (0.08 ) Non-GAAP EPS $ 0.78 $ 0.62 25.8% (1) Represents costs associated with our restructuring efforts, primarily severance, lease termination costs and asset impairments related to certain company-operated store closures, as well as business process optimization costs, largely consulting fees.
