TABLE OF CONTENTS ABOUT HONEYWELL EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Our rigorous operating principles allowed us to once again deliver a very strong performance in 2022. We grew our market share and positioned our businesses for continued success in the future. In 2022, we delivered sales growth of 3% (6% organically (1) , 7% organically excluding lost Russian sales (2) ), led by strong demand in our Commercial Aviation, Advanced Materials, and Building Products businesses, as we experienced sales growth in three of our four reportable business segments. Empowered by our Honeywell Accelerator operating model, we adapted our approach to strained supply chains and mitigated profitability loss due to inflation. In 2022, we deepened commitments with critical suppliers, improved demand forecasting, enhanced communication across our businesses to coordinate larger orders with key suppliers, and reengineered products in an effort to significantly mitigate sales risk. We also embedded comprehensive near real-time inflation analysis into our operating system, enabling strategic pricing actions to help stay ahead of the inflation curve and protect profitability. We maintained our commitment to create long-term shareowner value by realizing the benefits of operational excellence and deploying $7.9 billion to capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, and mergers and acquisitions, which was approximately $2.6 billion in excess of our operating cash flow for the year. As we look forward, we intend to continue deploying capital to high-return opportunities, including software and services and sustainable technologies, which are intended to position our business for future growth. In 2023, we expect macroeconomic factors to remain turbulent. We continue to carry a robust backlog of $29.6 billion as of December 31, 2022, that provides a strong foundation for growth. YEAR IN REVIEW Sales up 3 % , up 6% on an organic (1) basis, or up 7% on an organic basis excluding lost Russian sales (2) Record backlog of Operating cash flows of $35.5 BILLION $29.6 BILLION $5.3 BILLION as we remain focused on leveraging our robust operating model to deliver growth despite headwinds from inflation, supply chain constraints, and impacts of the Russia-Ukraine conflict as of year-end, demonstrating strong demand in our end markets and positioning us well to convert for future growth as we remain focused on increasing operating cash flows through revenue growth, margin expansion, and improved working capital turnover (1) Organic sales % change and Organic sales % change excluding lost Russian sales are non-GAAP measures. Refer to the section titled Consolidated Operating Results within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for the definition and a reconciliation to the comparable GAAP measure. (2) Lost Russian sales is defined as the year-over-year decline in sales due to the decision to wind down our businesses and operations in Russia. This does not reflect management’s estimate of 2022 Russian sales absent the decision to wind down our businesses and operations in Russia. 3 Honeywell International Inc.

U.S. GOVERNMENT SALES The Company, principally through our Aerospace reportable business segment, sells to the U.S. government acting through its various departments and agencies and through prime contractors, including the U.S. Department of Defense (as both a prime contractor and subcontractor). We do not expect our overall operating results to be significantly affected by any proposed changes in 2023 federal defense spending due to the varied mix of the government programs which impact us (OEM production, engineering development programs, aftermarket spares and repairs, and overhaul programs), as well as our diversified customer base. U.S. government sales ($ in millions) Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Sales to the U.S. Department of Defense $ 2,886 $ 3,219 $ 3,661 Sales to other U.S. government departments and agencies 546 703 557 Total sales to the U.S. government $ 3,432 $ 3,922 $ 4,218 7 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS ABOUT HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS We engage in manufacturing, sales, service, and research and development globally. U.S. exports and non-U.S. manufactured products are significant to our operations. U.S. exports represented 12% of our total sales in 2022, 2021, and 2020. Non-U.S. manufactured products and services, mainly in Europe and Asia, were 40% of our total sales in 2022, 2021, and 2020. Manufactured products and systems and performance of services Year Ended December 31, 2022 Aerospace Honeywell Building Technologies Performance Materials and Technologies Safety and Productivity Solutions (% of Segment Sales) U.S. exports 24 % 2 % 11 % 2 % Non-U.S. manufactured products/services 19 % 62 % 53 % 37 % Information related to risks related to our foreign operations is included in the section titled Risk Factors under the caption “Macroeconomic and Industry Risks.” RAW MATERIALS The vast majority of principal raw materials used in our operations are readily available; however, during 2022, we experienced supply chain constraints for certain raw materials. We implemented short-term and long-term mitigation strategies to reduce the impact of disruptions, including digital solutions to assist in identifying and managing shortages. Mitigation strategies include material supply tracking tools, accelerated processes to communicate supply shortages, and direct engagement with key suppliers to meet customer demand. Where we cannot procure certain raw materials, we redesigned existing products or developed new products to satisfy current and changing demand where feasible. Redesigned products, or the development of new products, undergo product quality controls and engineering qualification prior to releasing to our customers. Further, our relationships with primary and secondary suppliers allow us to reliably source raw materials. We continue to leverage existing supplier relationships and are not dependent on any one supplier for a material amount of our raw materials. We believe these mitigation strategies enable us to reduce supply risk, accelerate new product innovation, and expand our penetration in the markets we serve. Prices of certain key raw materials are expected to fluctuate, including copper, fluorspar, tungsten salts, ethylene, aluminum, and molybdenum in our Performance Materials and Technologies reportable business segment and nickel, steel, titanium, and other metals in our Aerospace reportable business segment. We offset raw material cost increases with formula-driven or long-term supply agreements, price increases, and hedging activities where feasible. We anticipate that supply chain constraints for certain raw materials will continue into 2023; however, we believe our short-term and long-term mitigation strategies position us well to mitigate and reduce the impact these factors may have on our businesses. As such, we do not presently anticipate that a shortage of raw materials will cause any material adverse impacts during 2023. See the section titled Risk Factors for additional information on supply chain constraints. PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES, AND DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS Our reportable business segments are not dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents, trademarks, or any licenses or distribution rights. In our judgment, our intellectual property rights are adequate for the conduct of our business. We believe that, in the aggregate, the rights under our patents, trademarks, licenses, and distribution rights are generally important to our operations, but we do not consider any individual patent, trademark, or any licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process or product to be of material importance in relation to our total business. 8 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS ABOUT HONEYWELL REGULATIONS Our operations are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign government regulations, including requirements regarding the protection of human health and the environment. We design our policies, practices, and procedures to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage, and of resulting financial liability, in connection with our business. Some risk of environmental damage is, however, inherent in some of our operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses. We engage in the handling, manufacturing, use, and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous by one or more regulatory agencies. We design policies, practices, and procedures to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury, and to ensure that our handling, manufacture, use, and disposal of these substances meet or exceed environmental and safety laws and regulations. It is possible that future knowledge or other developments, such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies, could bring into question our current or past handling, manufacture, use, or disposal of these substances. Among other environmental requirements, we are subject to the Federal Superfund and similar state and foreign laws and regulations, under which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated with current and former operating sites and various hazardous waste sites, some of which are on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s National Priority List. While there is a possibility that a responsible party might be unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible parties, we do not anticipate having to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multi-party situations taken as a whole. We do not believe that Federal, State, and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, or any existing or pending climate change legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect in the foreseeable future on the Company’s business and we will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area. Beyond our compliance requirements with environmental regulations, compliance with other government regulations has not had, and based on laws and regulations currently in effect, is not expected to have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. See the section titled Risk Factors for additional information on government regulation that could impact our business. SUSTAINABLE COMMITMENTS AND SOLUTIONS Our commitment to being environmentally responsible is reflected in the extensive work we do to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, increase energy efficiency, conserve water, minimize waste, and drive efficiency throughout our operations. Honeywell also champions responsible remediation projects and efforts to make our products safer and more sustainable. CARBON NEUTRAL PLEDGE BY 2035 In 2021, we announced our commitment to be carbon neutral by 2035 in our facilities and operations. Our GHG reduction program initially began in 2004, in our view setting us well on our way to achieving this commitment. We are allocating resources each year to projects that support this target: • Energy Efficiency Improvements. Since project tracking began in 2010, more than 6,300 sustainability projects, including building automation and controls, lighting, compressed air and gas systems, and mechanical upgrades have been implemented at our facilities. Our largest sites are required to identify their significant energy use in line with ISO 50001, obtain an energy audit on an established cycle, train personnel on energy management, and track identified projects via our standard database. This ensures a robust pipeline of both low-cost and capital projects that can be considered for execution. As of December 31, 2022, 26 Honeywell locations have achieved ISO 50001, the global energy management systems standard for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and improving energy management. • Fleet Electrification. We developed a strategy to further improve our fleet’s fuel economy through a plan to electrify our global fleet of over 7,500 vehicles where conditions and markets allow by 2035 or earlier. In 2022, we took delivery of our first fully electric light duty vehicles (LDVs) in North America as part of an initial pilot. This pilot will inform and shape our future policies and strategy, adoption rate by business group, and vehicle class selection. • Renewable Energy Transition. We are investing in renewable energy resources. For example, we are implementing multiple solar projects, which include solar rooftop and carport solar systems to reduce our power grid consumption. 9 Honeywell International Inc.

Additional information regarding our sustainability initiatives and strategy is included in our 2022 Environmental, Social, and Governance Report, which can be found on our website (honeywell.com); this report is not incorporated into this Form 10-K by reference and should not be considered part of this Form 10-K. 10 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS ABOUT HONEYWELL HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT We believe a commitment to and investment in human capital management enables better decision-making, helps us build competitive advantage, and furthers our long-term success. As of December 31, 2022, we employed approximately 97,000 (1) employees across 79 countries, 34,000 (1) of whom are in the United States. Human capital management is the key driver of our performance culture, which enables our workforce to respond to the fast-changing needs of our customers. As of December 31, 2022 , we employed approximately 97,000 EMPLOYEES (1) Across 79 COUNTRIES 34,000 (1) of whom are in the United States. (1) Excludes Sandia National Laboratories (Sandia) and Kansas City National Security Campus (KCNSC) work forces of approximately 22,000 employees. Sandia and KCNSC are U.S. Department of Energy facilities. Honeywell manages these facilities as a contract operator and does not establish or control their human resource policies. OUR CULTURE Honeywell has built a reputation of “doing what we say.” At the center of that commitment to excellence is a high-performance culture that is rooted in our Foundational Principles and driven by the 8 Honeywell Behaviors. The 8 Behaviors reflect the bold, entrepreneurial spirit we seek to foster while emphasizing our goal to operate with speed and precision. At their foundation is a commitment to Integrity and Ethics, Inclusion and Diversity, and Workplace Respect, fundamental values that underlie everything we do. 11 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS ABOUT HONEYWELL Our Code of Business Conduct establishes the baseline requirements of our integrity and compliance program and promotes an environment where everyone is treated ethically and with respect. It outlines our pledge to recognize the dignity of each individual, respect each employee, provide compensation and benefits that are competitive, promote self-development through training, and value diversity of perspectives and ideas. All employees must complete Code of Business Conduct training and, where permitted by law, must also certify each year that they will comply with the Code. Overall, we believe our culture, along with our internal tools and initiatives, enable us to effectively execute our human capital strategy. For discussion on the risks relating the ability to attract and retain top-performing talent, please see the section titled Risk Factors. TALENT ACQUISITION AND MANAGEMENT Our internal talent acquisition and management platform is a key component to recruiting, hiring, and developing top-performing talent. Our hiring practices consider a diverse slate of candidates and our hiring managers are provided training and toolkits to reinforce their role in bringing diverse talent into the Company. We apply a “diversity of slate” requirement, a requirement to interview at least one diverse candidate, unless an exception is approved by human resources leadership, when hiring for any exempt role in the U.S. or for any management, professional, or senior administrative role globally. Further, we partner with top academic institutions and external professional organizations to enhance the diversity of our workforce to attract and retain top talent. Our talent review process requires our people managers to have semi-annual career discussions with each member of their teams to discuss the best opportunity for growth and development, which enhances our identification of candidates for internal promotion and succession planning. VOICE OF THE EMPLOYEE In 2021, we introduced a Voice of the Employee feedback survey to all employees globally with the commitment to listening, learning, and taking action to make Honeywell an even better place to work. The survey provides data and tools to leaders at all levels to best drive actionable plans around employee engagement and build our desired culture that attracts and retains top talent, improves performance, and distinguishes the Company as a great place to work. The survey is conducted annually in April with a pulse survey in October. EMPLOYEE WELL-BEING Our well-being focus addresses physical, mental, financial, and individual needs, providing benefits and resources to help employees and their families be their best, both personally and professionally. We implemented several campaigns to promote well-being and help provide visibility to resources and available benefits. Across the world, mental health is an increasingly important issue, so we created a focused campaign – Mental Health Awareness Month – to promote a variety of resources available to support our employees and their families. We offer Employee Assistance Programs or therapy sessions to all employees and family members globally, comprehensive mental health benefits to those enrolled in the U.S. medical plan, virtual mental health options and navigation tools to improve access and speed of care, and preventive/mental health resilience programs. 12 Honeywell International Inc.

We further our foundational principle of Inclusion and Diversity by focusing on three key priorities: REPRESENTATION RETENTION RECOGNITION Cultivate a workforce that reflects our communities and the world Create employee development and advancement opportunities Be a global employer of choice for Inclusion and Diversity Sustain a pipeline of diverse talent from campus to the C-Suite Foster community engagement and belonging Leverage our culture as a competitive advantage Promote a culture of inclusion, accessibility, and respect Offer competitive compensation, rewards, and recognition Lead on Inclusion and Diversity practices Our commitment to Inclusion and Diversity starts at the top with a diverse Board of Directors and executive management team, who represent a broad spectrum of backgrounds and perspectives. We believe that the diversity of our current Board of Directors (four women, including two African American, one Hispanic, and one Asian American director) and the diversity of Honeywell’s executive leadership (five of the Company’s ten executive officers are diverse by ethnic background, non-U.S. place of birth, or gender) supports our evolving business strategy and is a testament to Honeywell’s ongoing commitment to hiring, developing, and retaining diverse talent. The Company’s commitment to Inclusion and Diversity enables better decision-making, helps build competitive advantages, and furthers long-term success. In 2020, we established a Global Inclusion and Diversity Steering Committee co-sponsored by our Chairman and CEO, Senior Vice President and General Counsel, and Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer and fortified our inclusion and diversity governance structure by embedding Inclusion and Diversity Councils in each of our business groups. The governance structure provides a scalable model that supports our nine affinity group employee networks and facilitates the introduction of new networks to reflect the diverse characteristics of our workforce. These networks are designed to provide training and development opportunities and expand internal networks for promotional opportunities.

TABLE OF CONTENTS MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in tables and graphs in millions) The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Honeywell International Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (Honeywell or the Company) for the three years ended December 31, 2022. All references to Notes relate to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the section titled Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. A detailed discussion of the prior year 2021 to 2020 year-over-year changes is not included herein and can be found in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section in the 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed February 1 1 , 202 2 . BUSINESS UPDATE In July 2022, we realigned certain business units within the Safety and Productivity Solutions reportable business segment. The Safety and Retail business unit, which included our gas detection and safety business, combined with the Advanced Sensing Technologies business unit to form the Sensing and Safety Technologies business unit. This realignment provides opportunities to capitalize on shared synergies and core technologies resulting in greater value for our customers and the markets we serve. We recast historical periods to reflect this realignment. On August 16, 2022, the U.S. federal government enacted the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 into law. The bill includes numerous tax provisions, including a 15% corporate minimum tax as well as a 1% excise tax on share repurchases. We continue to evaluate the impact of this law on our operations; at this point, the legislation is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS Throughout 2022 and continuing into 2023, the global economy experienced and continues to experience significant supply chain disruptions, geopolitical tensions, and inflationary cost pressures. Labor shortages continue to place a strain on our operations and the operations of our suppliers, creating challenges in procurement of materials and delivering products and services to our customers. In addition, in certain regions of Asia, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted our business operations and our customers' and suppliers' ability to operate at normal levels. We anticipate supply chain constraints and the inflationary environment to continue into 2023, and in response have implemented short-term and long-term strategies to mitigate the impact. Mitigation strategies include pricing actions, material supply tracking tools, refinement of escalation processes to communicate supply shortages, and direct engagement with key suppliers to meet customer demand. Where we cannot procure key components or raw materials, we redesigned existing products or developed new products to satisfy current and changing demand where feasible. Redesigned products, or the development of new products, undergo product quality controls and engineering qualification prior to releasing to our customers. Further, our relationships with primary and secondary suppliers allow us to reliably source key components and raw materials. We believe these mitigation strategies enable us to reduce supply risk, accelerate new product innovation, and expand our penetration in the markets we serve. Additionally, due to the strenuous quality controls and product qualification we perform on new or redesigned products, we do not expect these mitigation strategies to impact product quality or reliability. During 2022, the Russia-Ukraine conflict introduced volatility in global financial and energy markets, increasing energy costs and exacerbating existing supply chain constraints, which added to the inflationary pressures in the global economy. We continue to actively work with our suppliers to minimize impacts of supply shortages on our manufacturing capabilities, and we implemented strategies to reduce our reliance on natural gas at critical sites in Europe. If we are not successful in sustaining or executing these strategies, these macroeconomic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or operating cash flows. See the section titled Review of Business Segments for additional information on the impacts of inflationary cost pressures, supply chain constraints, and labor shortages to our businesses. 16 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS See the section titled Risk Factors for a discussion of risks associated with the potential adverse effects of inflationary cost pressures, supply chain disruptions, and labor shortages to our businesses. RUSSIA-UKRAINE CONFLICT The Russia-Ukraine conflict, which began in February 2022, continues to negatively impact our businesses and operations and drive global economic and political uncertainty. In response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, in March 2022, we suspended substantially all of our sales, distribution, and service activities in Russia and Belarus (the Suspension). In June 2022, we approved a plan to wind down our existing businesses and operations in Russia (the Wind down). During September and October 2022, we completed the sale of three entities domiciled in Russia. For our two remaining entities, we are pursuing a voluntary liquidation strategy to completely exit our businesses and operations in Russia. The Suspension and Wind down impacts all reportable business segments, with the most significant impact to our Performance Materials and Technologies reportable business segment. In light of the humanitarian crisis created by the Russia-Ukraine conflict, we remain focused on efforts to assist and support our employees and their families impacted by the conflict. In March 2022, we created a Ukraine Relief Fund, allowing employees to make donations to support organizations providing direct assistance to Ukrainians and those that are assisting them in the midst of this humanitarian crisis. Additionally, as the conflict began, we accelerated payroll payments to those affected by the conflict and our initial Suspension of our operations. The impacts of the initial Suspension and Wind down to revenue, net income, net assets, or cash flow from operations for the periods recognized are not material to our consolidated results of operations and consolidated financial position. For the year ended December 31, 2021, revenue from sales in Russia represented approximately 1% of our global revenues, and assets in Russia represented less than 1% of our total assets. Our estimate of potential future losses or other contingencies related to the Suspension and Wind down activities, including any guarantee payments or any litigation costs or as otherwise related to our Wind down in Russia, could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations in the periods recognized but would not be material with respect to our consolidated financial position. As the conflict evolves, existing conditions may worsen or other impacts that are unknown at this time may arise that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. See the section titled Review of Business Segments for additional information on the impacts of the Russia-Ukraine conflict to our businesses. See Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures and Note 4 Repositioning and Other Charges of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the sale of our Russian entities and charges recognized related to the Suspension and Wind down, respectively. See the section titled Risk Factors for additional information on potential risks to our business related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict. 17 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Financial Results Net Sales by Segment 18 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Segment Profit by Segment 19 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS Net Sales The change in net sales was attributable to the following: 2022 Versus 2021 2021 Versus 2020 Volume (4) % 1 % Price 10 % 3 % Foreign currency translation (3) % 1 % Acquisitions, divestitures, and other, net — % — % Total % change in Net sales 3 % 5 % 2022 compared with 2021 A discussion of net sales by reportable business segment can be found in the Review of Business Segments section of this Management Discussion and Analysis. Net sales increased due to the following: • Increased pricing, • Partially offset by lower sales volumes, and • The unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, driven by the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the currencies of the majority of our international markets, primarily the Euro, British Pound, Turkish Lira, Chinese Renminbi, and Australian Dollar. Reconciliation of Reported Sales % Change to Organic Sales % Change and Organic Sales % Change Excluding Lost Russian Sales 2022 Versus 2021 2021 Versus 2020 Total Reported % change in Net sales 3 % 5 % Less: Foreign currency translation (3) % 1 % Less: Acquisitions, divestitures, and other, net — % — % Total Organic (1) % change in Net sales 6 % 4 % Less: Sales decline attributable to lost Russian sales (2) (1) % — % Total Organic % change excluding lost Russian sales 7 % 4 % (1) Organic sales % change, presented for all of our reportable business segments, is defined as the change in net sales, excluding the impact on sales from foreign currency translation and acquisitions, net of divestitures, for the first 12 months following the transaction date. We believe this non-GAAP measure is useful to investors and management in understanding the ongoing operations and analysis of ongoing operating trends. (2) Lost Russian sales is defined as the year-over-year decline in sales due to the decision to wind down our businesses and operations in Russia. This does not reflect management’s estimate of 2022 Russian sales absent the decision to wind down our businesses and operations in Russia . 20 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Cost of Products and Services Sold 2022 compared with 2021 Cost of products and services sold increased in 2022 primarily due to the following: • Higher direct and indirect material costs and higher labor costs of approximately $1.4 billion or 6%, • Partially offset by lower sales volumes of approximately $1 billion or 4%. Gross Margin 2022 compared with 2021 Gross margin increased by approximately $0.6 billion and gross margin percentage increased 80 basis points to 32.8% compared to 32.0% for the same period of 2021. 21 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 2022 compared with 2021 Selling, general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to the following: • Higher repositioning and other costs of approximately $0.2 billion or 4%, including charges and accrual of reserves directly attributable to the initial Suspension and Wind down of businesses and operations in Russia, and • Higher labor costs of $0.1 billion or 2%. Other (Income) Expense 2022 2021 2020 Other (income) expense $ (366) $ (1,378) $ (675) 2022 compared with 2021 Other income decreased primarily due to the following: • Lower pension and other postretirement income of approximately $0.6 billion, and • Net expenses related to the NARCO Buyout and HWI Sale of approximately $0.3 billion. For additional information regarding the NARCO Buyout and HWI Sale, see Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 22 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Tax Expense 2022 compared with U.S. Statutory Rate The effective tax rate for 2022 was higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the following: • Tax expense from restructuring, incremental tax reserves, and state taxes, representing a 320 basis-point increase, • Offset by benefits received from employee share-based payments and tax credits, representing a 210 basis-point decrease. For further discussion of changes in the effective tax rate, see Note 5 Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Net Income Attributable to Honeywell 2022 compared with 2021 Earnings per share of common stock–assuming dilution decreased primarily due to the following: • Higher repositioning and other charges, including charges and accrual of reserves directly attributable to the initial Suspension and Wind down of businesses and operations in Russia and net charges for the NARCO Buyout and HWI Sale, impacted earnings per share by $0.86 after tax, and • Higher pension mark-to-market expense and lower pension income impacted earnings per share by $0.69 after tax, • Partially offset by higher segment profit from our reportable business segments impacted earnings per share by $0.53 after tax. 23 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS REVIEW OF BUSINESS SEGMENTS We globally manage our business operations through four reportable business segments: Aerospace, Honeywell Building Technologies, Performance Materials and Technologies, and Safety and Productivity Solutions.

Segment profit increased $51 million and segment margin percentage increased 240 basis points to 15.6% compared to 13.2% for the same period in 2021. During the second quarter of 2022, our Productivity Solutions and Services business entered into a license and settlement agreement (the Agreement). Under the Agreement, we will receive up to $360 million, paid in equal quarterly installments over eight quarters, beginning with the second quarter of 2022. The Agreement provides each party a license to its existing patent portfolio for use by the other party’s existing products and resolves all patent-related litigation between the parties. 27 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS REVIEW OF BUSINESS SEGMENTS CORPORATE AND ALL OTHER Corporate and All Other primarily includes unallocated corporate costs, interest expense on holding-company debt, and the controlling majority-owned interest in Quantinuum. Corporate and All Other is not a separate reportable business segment as segment reporting criteria is not met for the activities reported with Corporate and All Other and the Company does not believe the results of operations are meaningful to investors. The Company continues to monitor the activities in Corporate and All Other to determine the need for further reportable business segment disaggregation. REPOSITIONING CHARGES See Note 4 Repositioning and Other Charges of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our repositioning actions and related charges incurred in 2022, 2021, and 2020. We recognized higher Total net repositioning and other charges in 2022 compared to 2021 due to the recognition of Asbestos-related charges, net of insurance and reimbursements related to the North American Refractory Company (NARCO) Buyout and HarbisonWalker International Holdings, Inc. (HWI) Sale, and Other charges related to the initial Suspension and Wind down of our business and operations in Russia. Cash spending related to our repositioning actions was $275 million, $382 million, and $564 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, and was funded through operating cash flows. 28 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS RISK FACTORS Our business, operating results, cash flows, and financial condition are subject to the material risks and uncertainties set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. MACROECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY RISKS Each of our businesses is subject to unique industry and economic conditions that may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations. • Aerospace —Our Aerospace business is impacted by customer buying patterns of aftermarket parts, supplier stability, factory transitions, and global supply chain capacity constraints that may lead to shortages of crucial components. Operating results may be adversely affected by downturns in the global demand for air travel, which may impact new aircraft production or result in the delay or cancellation of new aircraft orders, delays in launch schedules for new aircrafts, the retirement of aircrafts, and reductions in global flying hours, which impacts air transport and regional, business, and general aviation aircraft utilization rates. Operating results may also be adversely affected by any decrease in air travel demand due to regional restrictions or suspension of service for public health, safety, or environmental events, such as the effects of a global pandemic, which impacted our operating results in 2022. Operating results could also be impacted by changes in overall trends related to end market demand for the product portfolio, as well as new entrants and non-traditional players entering the market. Operating results in our Defense and Space business unit may be affected by the mix of U.S. and foreign government appropriations for defense and space programs and by compliance risks. Results may also be impacted by the potential introduction of counterfeit parts into our global supply chain. • Honeywell Building Technologies —Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in the level of global commercial construction activity (including retrofits and upgrades), lower capital spending and operating expenditures on building projects, changes in the competitive landscape, including new market entrants and new technologies, and fluctuations in inventory levels in distribution channels. • Performance Materials and Technologies —Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, refining, petrochemical, and semiconductor plants, our customers’ availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion, raw material demand and supply, product commoditization, continued illegal imports of hydrofluorocarbons into Europe, and our ability to maximize our facilities’ production capacity and minimize downtime. Periods of increased volatility in oil and natural gas prices may result in less investment by our customers and therefore, lower demand for our products and services. • Safety and Productivity Solutions —Operating results may be adversely impacted by reduced investments in process automation, safety monitoring, and plant capacity utilization initiatives, fluctuations in retail markets, a slowdown in demand for safety products, changes in the competitive landscape, including new market entrants and new technologies that may lead to product commoditization, and adverse industry economic conditions, all of which could result in lower market share, reduced selling prices, and lower margins. A significant percentage of our sales and operations is in non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory, foreign exchange, and other risks of international operations. Our international operations, including U.S. exports, represent more than half of the Company’s sales. Risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations, wage and price controls, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, antitrust regulations, employment regulations, foreign investment laws, import, export and other trade restrictions (such as sanctions and embargoes), differing levels of protection of intellectual property, acts of industrial espionage, violations by our employees of anti-corruption laws (despite our efforts to mitigate such risk), changes in regulations regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private enterprises, acts of terrorism, acts of war, civil strife, and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions. Instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment and the evolving international and domestic political, regulatory, and economic landscape, including the potential for changes in global trade policies, such as sanctions and trade barriers, and trends such as populism, economic nationalism and negative sentiment toward multinational companies, as well as the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide, can impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing, or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins. Existing free trade laws and regulations provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs, or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products or from where we import products or raw materials, either directly or through our suppliers, could have an impact on our competitive position and financial results. 29 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS RISK FACTORS The U.S. continues to implement certain trade actions, including imposing tariffs on certain goods imported from China and other countries, which has resulted in retaliatory tariffs by China and other countries. Additional tariffs, export controls and sanctions laws imposed by the U.S. on a broader range of imports, or further retaliatory trade measures taken by China or other countries in response, could increase the cost of our products. In response to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the U.S. and other countries imposed actions including sanctions, export and import controls, and trade restrictions with respect to Russian and Belarusian governments, government-related entities, and other entities and individuals. Further, the Russian government implemented retaliatory actions against the U.S. and other nation members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as well as certain other nations. As a result of these governmental actions, in March 2022, we suspended substantially all of our sales, distribution, and service activities in Russia and Belarus (the Suspension), and in June 2022, we decided to wind down our existing businesses and operations in Russia (the Wind down). Given the uncertainty inherent in our remaining obligations related to our contracts with Russian counterparties, we do not believe it is possible to develop estimates of reasonably possible loss in excess of current accruals for these matters. Based on available information to date, the Company's estimate of potential future losses or other contingencies related to the Suspension and Wind down activities, including guarantee payments or any litigation costs or as otherwise related to our Wind down in Russia, could adversely affect the Company's consolidated results of operations in periods recognized but would not be material with respect to the Company's consolidated financial position. As the conflict continues to evolve, existing conditions may worsen, or other impacts, including escalation of the conflict in other regions of Europe where there is a material portion of our business, increased tension between Russia and the U.S. and other NATO members and other countries, or other impacts that are unknown at this time, could lead to increased charges and could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. These impacts may result in increased costs or additional impacts on our operations and may adversely affect our ability to meet contractual and financial obligations, results of operations, and financial condition. To the extent the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine escalates, it may also negatively impact other risk factors disclosed in this Form 10-K and further impact our financial results. Such risks include, but are not limited to, adverse effects on macroeconomic conditions, including inflation and consumer spending; cybersecurity incidents and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure or that of our customers and suppliers, including disruptions at our cloud computing, server, systems and other third party IT service providers; adverse changes in international trade policies and relations; our ability to implement and execute our business strategy, particularly in Eastern Europe and surrounding regions; disruptions in global supply chains; energy shortages; terrorist activities targeting U.S. government contractors and/or critical infrastructure; our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations; and constraints, volatility, or disruption in the capital markets. Operating outside of the U.S. also exposes us to foreign exchange risk, which we monitor and seek to reduce through hedging activities. However, foreign exchange hedging activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us or be successful in eliminating such volatility. Finally, we generate significant amounts of cash outside of the U.S. that is invested with financial and non-financial counterparties. While we employ comprehensive controls regarding global cash management to guard against cash or investment loss and to ensure our ability to fund our operations and commitments, a material disruption to the counterparties with whom we transact business could expose Honeywell to financial loss. Operating outside the U.S. also exposes us to additional intellectual property risk. The laws and enforcement practices of certain jurisdictions in which we operate may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the U.S. and may impose joint venture, technology transfer, local service or other foreign investment requirements, and restrictions that potentially compromise control over our technology and proprietary information. Failure of foreign jurisdictions to protect our intellectual property rights, an inability to effectively enforce such rights in foreign jurisdictions, or the imposition of foreign jurisdiction investment or sourcing restrictions or requirements could result in loss of valuable proprietary information and could impact our competitive position and financial results. Risks related to our defined benefit pension plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow. Significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets, discount rates, and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and require cash pension contributions in future periods. Changes in discount rates and actual asset returns different than our anticipated asset returns can result in significant non-cash actuarial gains or losses, which we record in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and, if applicable, in any quarter in which an interim re-measurement is triggered. With regard to cash pension contributions, funding requirements for our pension plans are largely dependent upon interest rates, actual investment returns on pension assets and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations. 30 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS RISK FACTORS OPERATIONAL RISKS Raw material price fluctuations, inflation, the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements, or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services, impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities. The cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products, particularly in Performance Materials and Technologies (copper, fluorspar, tungsten salts, ethylene, aluminum, and molybdenum) and in Aerospace (nickel, steel, titanium and other metals). As of December 31, 2022, Aerospace and Performance Materials and Technologies had 79% and 66%, respectively, of raw materials supply base under contract. Due to supply chain constraints and labor shortages, including as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there have been recent shortages of and inflationary trends in the cost of raw materials, including increases in labor and freight costs, for the transportation of raw materials. Any inability to source necessary materials when and as needed, offset material price or labor inflation through increased prices to customers, formula-driven or long-term fixed price contracts with suppliers, productivity actions, or commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations. Many major components, product equipment items, and raw materials, particularly in Aerospace, are procured or subcontracted on a single or sole-source basis. Although we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process and we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate, it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases, in addition to other supply chain disruptions, may have in the future. Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers’ inability to scale production and adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile demand. In addition, current or future global economic uncertainty, including volatile financial markets, geopolitical instability, potential recession, and other events such as the COVID-19 pandemic, may affect the financial stability of our key suppliers or their access to financing, which may in turn affect their ability to perform their obligations to us. If one or more of our suppliers experiences financial difficulties, delivery delays, or other performance problems, our resulting inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts, which could, in turn, result in reduced sales and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships. In an effort to reduce the impact of current and future supply chain disruptions, we have implemented short-term and long-term strategies to reduce the impact of such disruptions, including development of new or redesigned products that satisfy our product quality controls and engineering qualifications and/or any applicable regulatory requirements. We cannot provide any assurance that our mitigation strategies will continue to be successful, or that we will be able to alter our strategies or develop new strategies if and as needed. We may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions, and divestitures may not occur as planned. We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest non-core businesses. We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by (i) the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns, including risk of impairment; (ii) the failure to integrate multiple acquired businesses into Honeywell simultaneously and on schedule and/or to achieve expected synergies; (iii) the inability to dispose of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions; and (iv) the discovery of unanticipated liabilities, labor relations difficulties, cybersecurity concerns, compliance issues, or other problems in acquired businesses for which we lack contractual protections, insurance or indemnities, or, with regard to divested businesses, claims by purchasers to whom we have provided contractual indemnification. Our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance in increasingly competitive markets with acceptable margins. Our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to (i) identify and evolve with emerging technological and broader industry trends in our target end markets; (ii) develop and maintain competitive products; (iii) defend our market share against an ever-expanding number of competitors, including many new and non-traditional competitors; (iv) enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products; (v) develop, manufacture, and bring compelling new products to market quickly and cost-effectively; (vi) monitor disruptive technologies and business models; (vii) achieve sufficient return on investment for new products introduced based on capital expenditures and research and development spending; (viii) respond to changes in overall trends related to end market demand; and (ix) attract, develop, and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customers’ needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products. Competitors may also develop after-market services and parts for our products which attract customers and adversely affect our return on investment for new products. The failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors or the failure to address any of the above factors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects. 31 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS RISK FACTORS Failure to increase productivity through sustainable operational improvements, as well as an inability to successfully execute repositioning projects or to effectively manage our workforce, may reduce our profitability or adversely impact our businesses. Our profitability and margin growth are dependent upon our ability to drive sustainable improvements. We seek productivity and cost savings benefits through repositioning actions and projects, such as consolidation of manufacturing facilities, transitions to cost-competitive regions, and product line rationalizations. Risks associated with these actions include delays in execution, additional unexpected costs, realization of fewer than estimated productivity improvements, and adverse effects on employee morale. We may not realize the full operational or financial benefits we expect, the recognition of these benefits may be delayed, and these actions may potentially disrupt our operations. In addition, organizational changes, increased attrition, failure to create and implement a succession plan for key Company positions, not retaining key talent, inability to attract new employees with unique skills, trends in rising labor costs and labor availability, labor relations difficulties, or workforce stoppage could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position, and results of operations. As a supplier to the U.S. government, we are subject to unique risks, such as the right of the U.S. government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance. U.S. government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform consistent with the terms of the applicable contract. Our contracts with the U.S. government are also subject to government audits that may recommend downward price adjustments and other changes. When appropriate and prudent, we made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in the past and may do so in the future. In addition, U.S. government contracts are subject to congressional funding, which may be unavailable due to changes in priorities or subject to continuing resolution, which may result in funding reductions, eliminations, or other effects that could impact our business. We are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement and security regulations. If, as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations (including investigation of violations of certain environmental, employment, or export laws), Honeywell or one of its businesses were found to have violated applicable law, then it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings, and/or have its export privileges suspended. Our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities. Mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. We continue to incur remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims, and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. Various federal, state, local, and foreign governments regulate the use of certain materials, the discharge of materials into the environment, and/or communications respecting certain materials in our products, and can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations, and require injunctive relief measures, including installation of costly equipment, implementation of operational changes to limit emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases, or limiting access of our products to markets, among others. In addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement of policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites, the establishment of stricter toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur additional costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 32 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS RISK FACTORS Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations. Cybersecurity is a critical component of the Company’s enterprise risk management program. Global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology (IT) systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company, its products, its customers, and/or its third party service providers, including cloud providers. Our customers, including the U.S. government, are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products, and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats and incidents, none of them to date have been material to the Company. We seek to deploy comprehensive measures to deter, prevent, detect, respond to and mitigate these threats, including identity and access controls, data protection, vulnerability assessments, continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems. Despite these efforts, cybersecurity incidents (against us or parties with whom we contract), depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties), theft of funds, and the disruption of business operations. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident and its effects include financial loss, reputational damage, litigation with third parties, theft of intellectual property, fines levied by the Federal Trade Commission or other government agencies, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs due to the increasing sophistication and proliferation of threats, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations. In addition, cybersecurity laws and regulations continue to evolve, and are increasingly demanding, both in the U.S. and globally, which adds compliance complexity and may increase our costs of compliance and expose us to reputational damage or litigation, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions, or fines in one or more jurisdictions. While we carry cyber insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The development of technology products and services presents security and safety risks. An increasing number of our products, services, and technologies are delivered with Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities and the accompanying interconnected device networks, which include sensors, data and advanced computing capabilities. We have developed product software designs that we believe are less susceptible to cyber-attacks, but despite these efforts, if our products and services that include IoT solutions do not work as intended or are compromised, the possible consequences include financial loss, reputational damage, exposure to legal claims or enforcement actions, theft of intellectual property, and diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations. Data privacy, data protection, and information security may require significant resources and present certain risks. We collect, store, have access to and otherwise process certain confidential or sensitive data, including proprietary business information, personal data or other information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and/or customer-imposed controls. Despite our efforts to protect such data, we may be vulnerable to material security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming errors, or employee errors that could potentially lead to the compromising of such data, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions. In addition, we operate in an environment in which there are different and potentially conflicting data privacy laws in effect in the various U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and we must understand and comply with each law and standard in each of these jurisdictions while ensuring the data is secure. For example, European laws require us to have an approved legal mechanism to transfer personal data out of Europe; the European Union General Data Protection Regulation imposes stringent requirements in how we collect and process personal data and provides for significantly greater penalties for noncompliance; and several other states and countries have passed or are considering laws that require personal data relating to their residents or citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions. Government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business, and violations of data privacy laws can result in fines, reputational damage, and civil lawsuits, any of which may adversely affect our business, reputation, and financial statements. 33 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS RISK FACTORS A material disruption of our operations, particularly at our manufacturing facilities or within our information technology infrastructure, could adversely affect our business. Our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems, and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to natural disasters or other disruptions, including hurricanes and floods, which may be exacerbated by the effects of climate change, power outages, fires, explosions, terrorism, equipment failures, sabotage, cyber incidents, any potential effects of climate change and adverse weather conditions, including water scarcity, labor disputes, critical supply failure, inaccurate downtime forecast, political disruption, public health crises, like a regional or global pandemic, and other reasons, which can result in undesirable consequences, including financial losses and damaged relationships with customers. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted and may continue to disrupt our supply chain, distribution channels, production facilities, operations and customer demand, which has negatively impacted our operations and adversely affected our business and could continue to do so. We employ information technology systems and networks to support the business and rely on them to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. Disruptions to our information technology infrastructure from system failures, shutdowns, power outages and energy shortages, telecommunication or utility failures, cybersecurity incidents, and other events, including disruptions at our cloud computing, server, systems and other third party IT service providers, could interfere with our operations, interrupt production and shipments, damage customer and business partner relationships, and negatively impact our reputation. In addition, the insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses resulting from any business interruption, including those resulting from a natural disaster or other severe weather event, and recurring extreme weather events or other adverse events could reduce the availability or increase the cost of insurance. Concentrations of credit, counterparty and market risk may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We maintain long-term contractual relationships with many of our customers, suppliers, and other counterparties. While we monitor the financial health of these counterparties, we are exposed to credit and market risks of such counterparties, including those concentrated in the same or similar industries and geographic regions. Changes in political and economic conditions could also lead to concerns about the creditworthiness of counterparties and their ability to pay in the same or similar industry or geography, impacting our ability to renew our long-term contractual arrangements or collect amounts due under these arrangements. Among other factors, changes in economic conditions, including an economic downturn or recession, could also result in the credit deterioration or insolvency of a significant counterparty. We are impacted by increasing stakeholder interest in public company performance, disclosure, and goal-setting with respect to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters. In response to growing customer, investor, employee, governmental, and other stakeholder interest in our ESG practices, including our procedures, standards, performance metrics, and goals, we have increased reporting of our ESG programs and performance and have established and announced goals and other objectives related to ESG matters. These goal statements reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them. Our ability to achieve any goal or objective, including with respect to ESG initiatives, is subject to numerous risks, many of which are outside of our control. Examples of such risks include: (i) the availability and cost of low- or non-carbon-based energy sources and technologies, (ii) evolving regulatory requirements affecting ESG standards or disclosures, (iii) the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability, diversity and other standards, (iv) our ability to recruit, develop, and retain diverse talent in our labor markets, and (v) the impact of our organic growth and acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or operations. In addition, standards for tracking and reporting on ESG matters have not been harmonized and continue to evolve. Our processes and controls for reporting of ESG matters may not always comply with evolving and disparate standards for identifying, measuring, and reporting ESG metrics, our interpretation of reporting standards may differ from those of others, and such standards may change over time, any of which could result in significant revisions to our performance metrics, goals or reported progress in achieving such goals. In addition, certain of our products and services, including offerings in our Defense and Space business unit, are unattractive to certain investors and may cause us to be increasingly subject to ESG-driven investment practices that preclude investment in our debt and equity. If our ESG practices or business portfolio do not meet evolving investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, then our reputation, our ability to attract or retain employees and our attractiveness as an investment, supplier, business partner, or acquiror could be negatively impacted. Our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill our goals, targets, and objectives or to satisfy various reporting standards within the timelines we announce, or at all, could have similar negative impacts and expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation. Global climate change and related regulations and changes in customer demand could negatively affect our operations and our business. The effects of climate change could create financial risks to our business. For example, the effects of physical impacts of climate change could disrupt our operations by impacting the availability and cost of materials needed for manufacturing, exacerbate existing risks to our supply chain, disrupt our operations, and increase insurance and other operating costs. These factors may impact our decisions to construct new facilities or maintain existing facilities in areas most prone to physical climate risks. We could also face indirect financial risks passed through the supply chain and disruptions that could result in increased prices for our products and the resources needed to produce them. 34 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS RISK FACTORS The growing focus on addressing global climate change has resulted in more regulations designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and more customer demand for products and services that have a lower carbon footprint or that help businesses and consumers reduce carbon emissions throughout their value chains. These regulations tend to be implemented under global, national and sub-national climate objectives or policies, and target the global warming potential of refrigerants, energy efficiency, and the combustion of fossil fuels. Although we offer and continue to invest in developing solutions that help our customers meet their carbon reduction and sustainability goals, many of our products combust fossil fuels, consume energy, and use refrigerants. Regulations and carbon reduction goals which seek to reduce greenhouse gas emissions could reduce demand for such products and present a risk to our business. We may be required to further increase research and development and other capital expenditures in order to develop offerings that meet these new regulations, standards, and customer demands. There can be no assurance that our new product development efforts will be successful, that our products will be accepted by the market, or that economic returns will reflect our investments in new product development. LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS Our U.S. and non-U.S. tax liabilities are dependent, in part, upon the distribution of income among various jurisdictions in which we operate, as well as changes in tax law or regulation. Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws, regulations and judicial rulings (or changes in the interpretation thereof), potential taxation of digital services, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures, and various other governmental enforcement initiatives. Our tax expense includes estimates of tax reserves and reflects other estimates and assumptions, including assessments of future earnings of the Company, which could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets. In addition, our future effective tax rates could be subject to volatility or adversely affected by changes in tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, or interpretations thereof. Changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations. The sales and margins of each of our reportable business segments are directly impacted by government regulations, including environmental, safety, performance, and product certification regulations. Within Aerospace, the operating results of Commercial Aviation Original Equipment and Commercial Aviation Aftermarket may be impacted by, among other things, mandates of the Federal Aviation Administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft. Our Defense and Space business unit may be affected by changes in government procurement regulations. Within Honeywell Building Technologies and Safety and Productivity Solutions, the demand for and cost of providing products, services and solutions can be impacted by fire, security, safety, health care, environmental, and energy efficiency standards and regulations. Performance Materials and Technologies’ results of operations can be impacted by environmental and health standards, regulations, and judicial determinations, including potential per/polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) legislation and regulations that, if adopted, could impact the sale of certain products in our Advanced Materials business, without fully assessing level of risk or environmental impact. Growth in all our businesses within emerging markets may be adversely impacted by the inability to acquire and retain qualified employees where local employment law mandates may be restrictive. Changes in such regulations and government policies could negatively impact us; for instance, noncompliance with legislation and regulations can result in fines and penalties, and compliance with any new regulations or policies may be burdensome and/or require significant expenditures. Increased focus and evolving views of lawmakers climate change and other environmental, social and governance issues could have long-term impact on our business and result of operations. Increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change and other ESG matters may result in more international, regional and/or federal regulatory or other stakeholder requirements or expectations that could mandate more restrictive or expansive standards, such as stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions, more prescriptive reporting of ESG metrics, practices and targets, than the voluntary commitments that the Company has adopted or require such changes on a more accelerated time frame. There continues to be a lack of consistent climate and other ESG legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty; however, there has been an increasing amount of legislative and regulatory activity, particularly in the European Union, United Kingdom, and U.S. New or revised legal and regulatory requirements could impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the Company or its products, and could negatively impact the Company’s business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition, and competitive position. 35 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS RISK FACTORS We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters, government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties. We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations, and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employment, employee benefits plans, intellectual property, antitrust, anti-corruption, accounting, import and export, and environmental, health, and safety matters. Our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities. The incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, and financial condition. 36 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS Information relating to market risks is included within Liquidity and Capital Resources of our Form 10-K under the caption “Financial Instruments.” LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (Dollars in tables in millions) We continue to manage our businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of liquidity. Each of our businesses is focused on increasing operating cash flows through revenue growth, margin expansion, and improved working capital turnover. Additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short-term debt from the commercial paper market, long-term borrowings, access to the public debt and equity markets, U.S. cash balances, and the ability to access non-U.S. cash balances. CASH We monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis. Our emphasis is primarily safety of principal and secondarily maximizing yield of those funds. We diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one counterparty. As of December 31, 2022, and 2021, we held $10.1 billion and $11.5 billion, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents, including our short-term investments. As of December 31, 2022, $5.0 billion of the Company’s cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were held by non-US subsidiaries. We do not have material amounts related to any jurisdiction subject to currency control restrictions that impact our ability to access and repatriate such amounts. Under current laws, we do not expect taxes on repatriation or restrictions on amounts held outside of the U.S. to have a material effect on our overall liquidity. BORROWINGS We leverage a variety of debt instruments to manage our overall borrowing costs. As of December 31, 2022, and 2021, our total borrowings were $19.6 billion. December 31, 2022 2021 Commercial paper and other short-term borrowings $ 2,717 $ 3,542 Variable rate notes 22 622 Fixed rate notes 17,086 15,314 Other 265 272 Fair value of hedging instruments (287) 60 Debt issuance costs (233) (211) Total borrowings $ 19,570 $ 19,599 A primary source of liquidity is our ability to access the corporate bond markets. Through these markets, we issue a variety of long-term fixed rate notes, in a variety of currencies, to manage our overall funding costs. Another primary source of liquidity is our ability to access the commercial paper market. Commercial paper notes are sold at a discount or premium and have a maturity of not more than 365 days from date of issuance. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing acquisitions. The weighted average interest rate on commercial paper and other short-term borrowings outstanding was 3.29% and 0.07% as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. 37 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We also have the following revolving credit agreements: • A $1.5 billion 364-Day Credit Agreement (the 364-Day Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks, dated March 24, 2022. Amounts borrowed under the 364-Day Credit Agreement are required to be repaid no later than March 23, 2023, unless (i) we elect to convert all then outstanding amounts into a term loan, upon which such amounts shall be repaid in full on March 23, 2024, or (ii) the 364-Day Credit Agreement is terminated earlier pursuant to its terms. The 364-Day Credit Agreement replaced the previously reported $1.5 billion 364-day credit agreement dated March 31, 2021, which was terminated in accordance with its terms effective March 24, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, there were no outstanding borrowings under our 364-Day Credit Agreement. • A $4.0 billion Five-Year Credit Agreement (the 5-Year Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks, dated March 24, 2022. Commitments under the 5-Year Credit Agreement can be increased pursuant to the terms of the 5-Year Credit Agreement to an aggregate amount not to exceed $4.5 billion. The 5-Year Credit Agreement amended and restated the previously reported $4.0 billion amended and restated five-year credit agreement dated March 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2022, there were no outstanding borrowings under our 5-Year Credit Agreement. We also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the SEC under which we may issue additional debt securities, common stock, and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. We anticipate that net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of existing indebtedness, share repurchases, capital expenditures, and acquisitions. CREDIT RATINGS Our ability to access the global debt capital markets and the related cost of these borrowings is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. Our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debt-rating agencies. As of December 31, 2022, S&P Global Inc. (S&P), Fitch Ratings Inc. (Fitch), and Moody’s Investor Service (Moody's) have ratings on our debt set forth in the table below: S&P Fitch Moody's Outlook Stable Stable Stable Short-term A-1 F1 P1 Long-term A A A2 CASH FLOW SUMMARY Our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, are summarized as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Change 2022 vs. 2021 2020 Change 2021 vs. 2020 Cash and cash equivalents at beginning of period $ 10,959 $ 14,275 $ (3,316) $ 9,067 $ 5,208 Operating activities Net income attributable to Honeywell 4,966 5,542 (576) 4,779 763 Noncash adjustments 1,946 971 975 1,284 (313) Changes in working capital (1,334) 51 (1,385) 617 (566) Other operating activities (304) (526) 222 (472) (54) Net cash provided by operating activities 5,274 6,038 (764) 6,208 (170) Net cash used for investing activities (93) (1,061) 968 (987) (74) Net cash used for financing activities (6,330) (8,254) 1,924 (81) (8,173) Effect of foreign exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (183) (39) (144) 68 (107) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents (1,332) (3,316) 1,984 5,208 (8,524) Cash and cash equivalents at end of period $ 9,627 $ 10,959 $ (1,332) $ 14,275 $ (3,316) 38 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES 2022 compared with 2021 Cash related to operating activities decreased by $764 million primarily due to an unfavorable impact to working capital. Working capital declined by $1,385 million, led by decreases in Accounts payable of $899 million, primarily due to a decrease in purchases of materials driven by lower sales volumes and a decrease in days payables outstanding, and increases in Accounts receivable of $731 million, primarily due to revenue growth mainly as a result of pricing actions. Operating cash flow was further reduced by the decrease in Net income attributable to Honeywell, partially offset by higher noncash adjustments for repositioning and other net charges for the NARCO Buyout and HWI Sale and charges related to the initial Suspension and Wind down of our business and operations in Russia, and a decrease in pension and other postretirement income. Cash related to investing activities increased by $968 million primarily due to a $1,148 million decrease in cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired. Cash related to financing activities increased by $1,924 million primarily due to a $3,067 million decrease in the payments of long-term debt and $436 million increase in proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt, partially offset by a $820 million increase in repurchases of common stock and $790 million decrease in the net proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and other short-term borrowings. CASH REQUIREMENTS AND ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LIQUIDITY In addition to our normal operating cash requirements, we expect our primary cash requirements in 2023 to be as follows: • Capital expenditures—we expect to spend approximately $1.0 billion for capital expenditures in 2023 primarily for growth, production and capacity expansion, implementation of cost reduction measures, maintenance, and replacement. • Share repurchases—under our share repurchase program, $2.9 billion was available as of December 31, 2022, for additional share repurchases. We expect to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock-based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. Additionally, we will seek to reduce share count via share repurchases as and when attractive opportunities arise. The amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and our level of operating, financing, and other investing activities. • Dividends—we increased our quarterly dividend rate by 5% to $1.03 per share of common stock effective with the fourth quarter 2022 dividend. We intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends in 2023. We continue to identify opportunities to improve our liquidity and working capital efficiency, which includes the extension of payment terms with our suppliers. In addition, multiple third-party financial institutions offer a voluntary supply chain financing (SCF) program which enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables from the Company to these financial institutions on terms that are negotiated between the supplier and the respective financial institution. We agree on commercial terms for the goods and services we procure from our suppliers, including prices, quantities, and payment terms, regardless of whether the supplier elects to participate in the SCF program. Our suppliers’ voluntary participation in the SCF program has no bearing on our payment terms and we have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to participate in the SCF program. Amounts due to our suppliers that elected to participate in the SCF programs are included in Accounts payable in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2022, Accounts payable included approximately $700 million payable to suppliers who have elected to participate in the SCF program. Amounts settled with third-party financial institutions through the SCF program increased approximately $200 million for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2022, ref lects a combination of an ext ension of payment terms with suppliers and increased utilization of our SCF program. All activity related to amounts due to suppliers that elected to participate in the SCF program is reflected in Cash flows from operating activities in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. While access to SCF could decrease if our credit ratings are downgraded, we do not believe that changes in the availability of SCF will have a significant impact on our liquidity. The impact of this program is not material to our overall liquidity. We sell trade receivables to unaffiliated financial institutions without recourse. Transfers of the receivables are accounted for as sales and, accordingly, receivables sold are excluded from Accounts receivable—net in the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are reflected in Cash flows from operating activities in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The difference between the carrying amount of the trade receivables sold and the cash received is recorded in Cost of products and services sold in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. The impact of this program is not material to our overall liquidity. Finally, we continue to assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit, market position, profit, and cash flow contribution in order to identify target investment and acquisition opportunities in order to upgrade our combined portfolio. We identify acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses. We also identify businesses that do not fit into our long-term strategic plan based on their market position, relative profitability, or growth potential. These businesses are considered for potential divestiture, restructuring, or other repositioning actions, subject to regulatory constraints. 39 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES In early 2023, we made payments of approximately $1.5 billion in connection with the NARCO Buyout and UOP Matters. During 2023, and pursuant to the NARCO Amended Buyout Agreement, we expect to receive approximately $295 million related to the HWI Sale. We believe these payments and receipts will not materially impact our liquidity position. See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the NARCO Buyout and UOP Matters. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs. Our available cash, committed credit lines, and access to the public debt and equity markets provide additional sources of short-term and long-term liquidity to fund current operations, debt maturities, and future investment opportunities. See Note 9 Long-term Debt and Credit Agreements of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of items impacting our liquidity. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS Following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and probable liability payments at December 31, 2022: Total (6)(7) Payments by Period Thereafter 2023 2024 - 2025 2026 - 2027 Long-term debt, including finance leases (1) $ 16,853 $ 1,730 $ 3,059 $ 2,523 $ 9,541 Interest payments on long-term debt, including finance leases 4,523 472 844 738 2,469 Operating lease liabilities 1,080 208 315 203 354 Purchase obligations (2) 2,844 1,453 962 283 146 Estimated environmental liability payments (3) 615 222 201 171 21 Asbestos-related liability payments (4) 1,291 111 204 178 798 Asbestos insurance recoveries (5) (130) (18) (29) (21) (62) $ 27,076 $ 4,178 $ 5,556 $ 4,075 $ 13,267 (1) Assumes all long-term debt is outstanding until scheduled maturity. (2) Purchase obligations are entered into with various vendors in the normal course of business and are consistent with our expected requirements. (3) The payment amounts in the table only reflect the environmental liabilities which are probable and reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2022. (4) These amounts are estimates of asbestos-related cash payments for Bendix based on our asbestos-related liabilities which are probable and reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2022. Amounts exclude payments made in January 2023 in connection with the NARCO Buyout. See Asbestos Matters in Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (5) These amounts represent our insurance recoveries that are deemed probable for asbestos-related liabilities as of December 31, 2022. See Asbestos Matters in Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (6) The table excludes tax liability payments, including those for unrecognized tax benefits. See Note 5 Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (7) The table excludes expected proceeds from the indemnification and reimbursement agreements entered into with Resideo. See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. ASBESTOS MATTERS Payments, net of insurance recoveries, related to known asbestos matters were $166 million, $240 million, and $229 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, and are estimated to be approximately $133 million in 2023. We expect to make payments associated with these asbestos matters from operating cash flows. The timing of these payments depends on several factors, including the timing of litigation and settlements of liability claims. In early 2023, we made payments of approximately $1.3 billion in connection with the NARCO Buyout. For additional information regarding the NARCO Buyout, see Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 40 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Accruals during the year for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable were $186 million, $168 million, and $173 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. In addition, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately $71 million, $88 million, and $88 million, respectively, relating to compliance with environmental regulations. Payments related to known environmental matters were $211 million, $210 million, and $216 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, and are estimated to be approximately $222 million in 2023. We expect to make payments associated with these environmental matters from operating cash flows. The timing of these payments depends on several factors, including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, execution timeframe of projects, remedial techniques to be utilized, and agreement with other parties. Reimbursements from Resideo for payments related to environmental matters at certain sites, as defined in the indemnification and reimbursement agreement, were $140 million in 2022 and are expected to be $140 million in 2023. See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our environmental matters and the indemnification and reimbursement agreement entered into with Resideo. 41 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Derivative financial instruments are not used for trading or other speculative purposes and we do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments.

TABLE OF CONTENTS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Many estimates and assumptions involved in the application of accounting principles have a material impact on reported financial condition and operating performance and on the comparability of such reported information over different reporting periods. Critical accounting estimates or assumptions are those where the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. We consider the estimates and assumptions discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Sales Recognition on Long-Term Contracts —We recognize sales for long-term contracts with performance obligations satisfied over time using either an input or output method. We recognize revenue over time as we perform on these contracts based on the continuous transfer of control to the customer. With control transferring over time, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. We generally use the cost-to-cost input method of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as we incur costs. Under the cost-to-cost input method, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the proportion of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of our performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion requires judgment. Contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). Cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends and other economic projections. Significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. Revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances. Impacts from changes in estimates of net sales and cost of sales are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis, which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a performance obligation’s percentage of completion. Anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recognized when such losses become evident. We maintain financial controls over the customer qualification, contract pricing, and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses. Income Taxes —On a recurring basis, we assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering all available positive and negative evidence, such as past operating results, projections of future taxable income, enacted tax law changes, and the feasibility and impact of tax planning initiatives. Our projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume, pricing and costs, as well as the timing and amount of reversals of taxable temporary differences. We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, including resolution of any related appeals and litigation. We assess our income tax positions based upon our evaluation of the facts, circumstances, and information available at the reporting date. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. For further discussion of additional income tax policies, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 43 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Impairment Testing —Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual, or more frequent if necessary, impairment testing. In testing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair value is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts, including strategic and annual operating plans, adjusted for terminal value assumptions. These impairment tests involve the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, and changes to those assumptions could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. To address this uncertainty, we perform sensitivity analyses on key estimates and assumptions. Once the fair value is determined, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, it is impaired. Any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and its fair value. Finite-Lived Intangible Assets —The determination of useful lives (for depreciation/amortization purposes) and whether or not intangible assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, and changes to those assumptions could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our finite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a finite-lived intangible asset group may not be fully recoverable. The principal factors in considering when to perform an impairment review are as follows: • Significant under-performance (i.e., declines in sales, earnings, or cash flows) of a business or product line in relation to expectations; • Annual operating plans or strategic plan outlook that indicate an unfavorable trend in operating performance of a business or product line; • Significant negative industry or economic trends; or • Significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. Once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary, recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. The impairment is then measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset grouping and its fair value. We endeavor to utilize the best information available to measure fair value, which is usually either market prices (if available), level 1 or level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, or an estimate of the future discounted cash flow, level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The key estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include assumptions as to expected industry and business growth rates, sales volume, selling prices and costs, cash flows, and the discount rate selected. These estimates are subject to changes in the economic environment, including market interest rates and expected volatility. Management believes the estimates of future cash flows and fair values are reasonable; however, changes in estimates due to variance from assumptions could materially affect the valuations. Defined Benefit Pension Plans —We sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. For financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension (income) expense is calculated annually based upon various actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets could materially affect the annual pension (income) expense amount. Annual pension (income) expense is comprised of service and interest cost, assumed return on plan assets, prior service amortization (Pension ongoing (income) expense), and a potential mark-to-market adjustment (MTM Adjustment). The key assumptions used in developing our net periodic pension (income) expense for our U.S. plans included the following: 2022 2021 2020 Discount rate: Projected benefit obligation 2.87 % 2.50 % 3.22 % Service cost 2.98 % 2.68 % 3.33 % Interest cost 2.26 % 1.76 % 2.76 % Assets: Expected rate of return 6.40 % 6.15 % 6.15 % Actual rate of return (10.45) % 6.84 % 13.81 % Actual 10 year average annual compounded rate of return 8.77 % 11.37 % 10.64 % The MTM Adjustment represents the recognition of net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans’ projected benefit obligation (the corridor). Net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the various assumptions used to value our pension plans or when assumptions change. The primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses are changes in the discount rate used to value pension obligations as of the measurement date each year and the difference between expected and actual returns on plan assets. The mark-to-market accounting method results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast MTM Adjustments. MTM Adjustments were expenses of $523 million, $40 million, and $44 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. 44 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets utilizing historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with our expectations of f uture market conditions and asset mix considerations (see Note 20 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the actual various asset classes and targeted asset allocation percentages for our pension plans). We plan to use an expected rate of return on plan assets of 6.75% for 2023, which is an increase in the assumption used for 2022. The discount rate reflects the market rate on December 31 (measurement date) for high-quality fixed income investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations and is subject to change each year. The discount rate can be volatile from year to year as it is determined based upon prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date. We used a 5.17% discount rate to determine benefit obligations as of December 31, 2022, reflecting an increase in the market interest rate environment since the prior year-end. In addition to the potential for MTM Adjustments, changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events also affects future Pension ongoing (income) expense. The following table highlights the sensitivity of our U.S. pension obligations and ongoing (income) expense to changes in these assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant. These estimates exclude any potential MTM Adjustment: Change in Assumption Impact on 2023 Pension Ongoing Expense Impact on Projected Benefit Obligation 0.25 percentage point decrease in discount rate Decrease $16 million Increase $310 million 0.25 percentage point increase in discount rate Increase $15 million Decrease $296 million 0.25 percentage point decrease in expected rate of return on assets Increase $41 million — 0.25 percentage point increase in expected rate of return on assets Decrease $41 million — Pension ongoing income for our world-wide pension plans is expected to be approximately $545 million in 2023 compared with Pension ongoing income of $993 million in 2022. The expected decrease in pension income is due to changes in market conditions over the course of 2022. Significantly higher discount rates globally have increased the interest cost on the plan obligations, while decreasing asset values in plans, reducing the expected return generated by the plan assets. Also, if required, a MTM Adjustment will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023 in accordance with our pension accounting method as previously described. It is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be a MTM Adjustment in 2023, and if one is required, what the magnitude of such adjustment will be. MTM Adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond the control of the Company such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets. Asbestos-Related Liabilities and Insurance Recoveries —The recognition of asbestos-related liabilities relates to a predecessor company, Bendix Friction Materials (Bendix). For Bendix asbestos-related claims, we accrue for the estimated value of pending claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. We also accrue for the estimated value of future claims related to Bendix over the full term of epidemiological disease projection through 2059 based on historic and anticipated claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and average resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. We update our assumptions on average payment values and average resolution values in the fourth quarter of each year. In connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos-related matters, we record asbestos-related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. In assessing the probability of insurance recovery, we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers. While the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which was considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. Projecting future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos-related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded. Given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections, we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries considering any changes to the projected liability, our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries. See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of management’s judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of our asbestos-related liabilities and related insurance recoveries. Contingent Liabilities —We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations, and claims (some of which involve substantial dollar amounts) arising out of the conduct of our business operations or those of previously owned entities, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, legal, and environmental, health, and safety matters. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters, the outcome of negotiations, the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claims, and the impact of evidentiary requirements. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to new developments (including new discovery of facts, changes in legislation, and outcomes of similar cases through the judicial system), changes in assumptions, or changes in our settlement strategy. See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of management’s judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of our environmental and asbestos liabilities which represent our most significant contingencies. 45 Honeywell International Inc.

MINE SAFETY DISCLOSURES One of our wholly-owned subsidiaries has a placer claim for and operates a chabazite ore surface mine in Arizona. Information concerning mine safety and other regulatory matters associated with this mine is required by Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K and is included in Exhibit 95 to this Form 10-K. 48 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Our common stock is listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (Nasdaq) under the ticker symbol “HON.” We increased our quarterly dividend rate by 5% to $1.03 per share of common stock effective with the fourth quarter 2022 dividend. We intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends in 2023. The number of record holders of our common stock at December 31, 2022, was 37,527. Information regarding securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans is included in the section titled Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters under the caption “Equity Compensation Plans.” On February 12, 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to a total of $10 billion of Honeywell common stock, which included amounts remaining under, and replaced, the previously approved share repurchase program. Repurchases may be made through a variety of methods, which could include open market purchases, accelerated share repurchase transactions, negotiated block transactions, 10b5-1 plans, other transactions that may be structured through investment banking institutions or privately negotiated, or a combination of the foregoing. Honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time (i) to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock-based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting, and matching contributions under our savings plans, and (ii) to reduce share count via share repurchases as and when attractive opportunities arise. The amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and the level of operating, financing, and other investing activities. During the quarter ended December 31, 2022, Honeywell purchased 6,783,496 shares of its common stock, par value $1 per share. As of December 31, 2022, $2.9 billion remained available for additional share repurchases. The following table summarizes our purchases of Honeywell's common stock for the three months ended December 31, 2022: Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (Dollars in millions) October 1 - 31, 2022 1,977,285 $ 176.99 1,977,285 $ 3,929 November 1 - 30, 2022 1,587,616 $ 209.41 1,587,616 $ 3,597 December 1 - 31, 2022 3,218,595 $ 214.45 3,218,595 $ 2,906 49 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES PERFORMANCE GRAPH The following graph compares the five-year cumulative total return on our common stock to the total returns on the S&P 500 Stock Index, composite of S&P’s Industrial Conglomerates and Aerospace and Defense indices, on a 55%/45% weighted basis (the Composite Index) and Nasdaq Industrial Select Sector (XLI Index). The weighting of the components of the Composite Index are based on our segments’ relative contribution to total segment profit. The selection of the Industrial Conglomerates component of the Composite Index reflects the diverse and distinct range of non-aerospace businesses conducted by Honeywell. The annual changes for the five-year period shown in the graph are based on the assumption that $100 was invested in Honeywell stock and each index on December 31, 2017, and that all dividends were reinvested.

TABLE OF CONTENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES The financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The following is a description of Honeywell’s significant accounting policies. PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Honeywell International Inc. and all of its subsidiaries and entities in which a controlling interest is maintained. The Company's consolidation policy requires equity investments that the Company exercises significant influence over, but does not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investee’s activities, to be accounted for using the equity method. Investments through which the Company is not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which the Company does not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. RECLASSIFICATIONS Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS The Company considers the applicability and impact of all Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations, Balance Sheet and Cash Flows (Consolidated Financial Statements). In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-04, Liabilities—Supplier Finance Programs (Topic 405): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations , to enhance the transparency of supplier finance programs. The new standard requires annual disclosure of the key terms of the program, a description of where in the financial statements amounts outstanding under the program are presented, a rollforward of such amounts, and interim disclosure of amounts outstanding as of the end of each period. The guidance does not affect recognition, measurement, or financial statement presentation of supplier finance programs. The ASU is effective on January 1, 2023, except for the rollforward, which is effective on January 1, 2024. The Company is currently evaluating the impacts of this guidance on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements . In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805) : Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers , which requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This ASU should be applied prospectively to acquisitions occurring on or after the effective date of December 15, 2022, and early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted this guidance on January 1, 2022. The adoption of this standard does not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting , which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by the transition away from reference rates expected to be discontinued to alternative reference rates. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope , to expand the scope of this guidance to include derivatives. The guidance was effective upon issuance and may be applied prospectively to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into on or before December 31, 2022. In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848 , which extends the period of time entities can utilize the reference rate reform relief guidance under ASU 2020-04 from December 31, 2022, to December 31, 2024. The Company will apply the guidance to impacted transactions during the transition period. The adoption of this standard does not have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. 57 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Research and development costs for projects are expensed as incurred, unless these costs relate to contracts with customers where the Company receives reimbursements. Amounts expensed as incurred for Company-sponsored research and development projects are included in Cost of products and services sold and were $ 1,478 million, $ 1,333 million, and $ 1,334 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Costs related to contracts with customers for customer-sponsored research and development projects are included as a contract cost and included in Cost of products and services sold when revenue from such contracts is recognized, consistent with the Company's sales recognition policies. This revenue was $ 1,336 million, $ 1,284 million, and $ 1,200 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly liquid investments having an original maturity of three months or less. INVENTORIES Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. Carrying value adjustments for inventory obsolescence is equal to the difference between the cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimate selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including any asset retirement obligations, less accumulated depreciation. For financial reporting, the straight-line method of depreciation is used over the estimated useful lives of 10 to 50 years for buildings and improvements an d 3 to 16 years for machinery and equipment. Recognition of the fair value of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets is required when there is a legal obligation to incur such costs. Upon initial recognition of a liability, the cost is capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the corresponding asset’s useful life. GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment testing annually as of the first day of the fourth quarter, or if a triggering event occurs or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. This testing compares carrying values to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value, not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill. The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of the first day of the fourth quarter, and determined that there was no impairment as of that date. The Company is not aware of any additional triggering events. Prior to 2022, the Company performed its annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment test as of the last day of the first quarter. In 2022, the Company changed the date of its annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment assessment to the first day of the fourth quarter. The Company believes this change does not represent a material change in method of applying an accounting principle. This change has been applied prospectively as of the date of the change, as retrospective application is deemed impracticable due to the inability to objectively determine the assumptions used in earlier periods without the benefit of hindsight. This voluntary change is preferable under the circumstances as it results in better alignment with the timing of the Company’s forecasting process and reduces the time period between the assessment date and annual financial statements. This change in accounting principle does not delay, accelerate, or avoid an impairment of goodwill. In 2022, due to this change the Company performed annual goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests as of the last day of the first quarter and the first day of the fourth quarter. FINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS Other intangible assets with determinable lives consist of customer lists, technology, patents and trademarks, and other intangibles and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 2 to 20 years. 58 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE The Company capitalizes costs of software developed or obtained for internal use during the application development stage of a project and amortizes those costs using the straight-line method over the expected useful life of the software, not to exceed 7 years. Costs incurred during the preliminary and post-implementation stages are expensed as incurred. Development costs for software held for sale are capitalized once a project has reached the point of technological feasibility. Completed projects are amortized after reaching the point of general availability using the straight-line method based on estimated useful life, not to exceed 7 years. At each balance sheet date, or earlier if an indicator of an impairment exists, we evaluate the recoverability of unamortized capitalized software costs based on estimated future undiscounted revenues net of estimated related costs over the remaining amortization period. Capitalized software held for internal use and held for sale is included in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside the United States with a functional currency other than U.S. Dollars are translated into U.S. Dollars using year-end exchange rates. Sales, costs, and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the year. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments, inventories and property, plant and equipment, including related expenses, are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect on the date the assets were acquired, while monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at year-end exchange rates. Remeasurement adjustments for these subsidiaries are included in earnings. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS All derivative financial instruments are recorded on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. For derivatives designated as hedges of the fair value of assets or liabilities, the changes in fair values of both the derivatives and the hedged items are recorded in current earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the changes in fair value of the derivatives are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged items impact earnings. Derivative financial instruments designated as hedges must be designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception of the contract. Changes in fair value of the derivative contract must be highly correlated with changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item at inception and over the life of the hedge contract. Cash flows of such derivative financial instruments are classified consistent with the underlying hedged item. The Company elected to exclude the time value of the derivatives (i.e., the forward points) from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize the initial value of the excluded component in earnings using the amortization approach. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a net investment hedge, the gain or loss is reported as a component of Other comprehensive income (loss) and recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The gain or loss will be subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. LEASES At the inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. The assessment is based on (i) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (ii) whether the Company obtains the right to substantially all the economic benefit from the use of the asset throughout the period, and (iii) whether the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. All significant lease arrangements are generally recognized at lease commencement. Operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement. An ROU asset and corresponding lease liability are not recorded for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less (short-term leases), and we recognize lease expense for these leases as incurred over the lease term. ROU assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset during the reasonably certain lease term, and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. The Company's lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. 59 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Lease payments may be fixed or variable, however, only fixed payments or in-substance fixed payments are included in determining the lease liability. Variable lease payments are recognized in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for those payments are incurred. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments related to initial direct cost and prepayments and excludes lease incentives. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. The Company primarily uses its incremental borrowing rate, which is based on the information available at the lease commencement date, in determining the present value of the lease payments. In determining the borrowing rate, the Company considers the lease term, secured incremental borrowing rate, and for leases denominated in a currency different than U.S. dollar, the collateralized borrowing rate in the foreign currency using the U.S. dollar and foreign currency swap spread, when available. PENSION BENEFITS The Company presents net periodic pension costs by disaggregating the service cost component of such costs and reports those costs in the same line item or items in the Consolidated Statement of Operations as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. The other non-service components of such costs are required to be presented separately from the service cost component. The Company records the service cost component of Pension ongoing (income) expense in Cost of products and services sold and Selling, general and administrative expenses. The remaining components of costs within Pension ongoing (income) expense, primarily interest costs and assumed return on plan assets, are recorded in Other (income) expense. The Company recognizes net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plan's projected benefit obligation (the corridor) annually in the fourth quarter each year (MTM Adjustment). The MTM Adjustment is also reported in Other (income) expense. SALES RECOGNITION Product and service sales are recognized when or as the Company transfers control of the promised products or services to its customers. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. Service sales, principally representing repair, maintenance, and engineering activities, are recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered. Sales under long-term contracts with performance obligations satisfied over time are recognized using either an input or output method. The Company recognizes revenue over time as the Company performs on these contracts because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer. With control transferring over time, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. The Company generally uses the cost-to-cost input method of progress for contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as the Company incurs costs. Under the cost-to-cost input method, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the proportion of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. The Company reviews its cost estimates on significant contracts on a periodic basis, or when circumstances change and warrant a modification to a previous estimate. Cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, and other economic projections. Significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. Provisions for anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recorded in full when such losses become evident, to the extent required. The customer funding for costs incurred for nonrecurring engineering and development activities of the Company's products under agreements with commercial customers is deferred and subsequently recognized as revenue as products are delivered to the customers. Additionally, expenses incurred, up to the customer agreed funded amount, are deferred as an asset and recognized as cost of sales when products are delivered to the customer. The deferred customer funding and costs result in recognition of deferred costs (asset) and deferred revenue (liability) within Other assets and Accrued liabilities, respectively, in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Deferred contract fulfillment costs were approximately $ 1.3 billion as of December 31, 2022, and 2021. The amounts recognized as Cost of products and services sold were approximately $ 0.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2022, and $ 0.1 billion for 2021 and 2020. Revenues for the Company's mechanical service programs are recognized as performance obligations that are satisfied over time, with recognition reflecting a series of distinct services using the output method. 60 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) The terms of a contract or the historical business practice can give rise to variable consideration due to, but not limited to, cash-based incentives, rebates, performance awards, or credits. The Company estimates variable consideration at the most likely amount the Company will receive from customers. The Company includes estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized for such transaction will not occur, or when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. The Company's estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of the Company's anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to the Company. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS The principal awards issued under the Company's stock-based compensation plans, which are described in Note 15 Stock-Based Compensation Plans, are non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units. The cost for such awards is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods (generally the vesting period of the equity award) and is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant to recognize expense for those awards that are expected to vest and are based on the Company's historical forfeiture rates. INCOME TAXES Significant judgment is required in evaluating tax positions. The Company establishes reserves for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum recognition threshold. The approach for evaluating certain and uncertain tax positions is defined by the authoritative guidance which determines when a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are examined by various federal, state, and foreign tax authorities. The Company regularly assesses the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of the Company's provision for income taxes. The Company continually assesses the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability, and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a change in estimate become known. For additional information, see Note 5 Income Taxes. EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and all dilutive potential common shares outstanding. ENVIRONMENTAL The Company accrues costs related to environmental matters when it is probable that it has incurred a liability related to a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated. For additional information, see Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies. ASBESTOS-RELATED LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE RECOVERIES The Company recognizes a liability for any asbestos-related contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. In connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos-related matters, the Company records asbestos-related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. For additional information, see Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies. REIMBURSEMENT RECEIVABLES In conjunction with the Resideo Technologies, Inc. (Resideo) spin-off, the Company entered into a reimbursement agreement under which Honeywell receives cash payments as reimbursement primarily related to net spending for environmental matters at certain sites as defined in the reimbursement agreement. Accordingly, the Company recorded receivables based on estimates of the underlying reimbursable Honeywell environmental spend, and the Company monitors the recoverability of such receivables, which are subject to the terms of applicable credit agreements and general ability to pay. 61 Honeywell International Inc.

For a summary by disaggregated product and services sales for each reportable business segment, refer to Note 22 Segment Financial Data. The Company recognizes revenue arising from performance obligations outlined in contracts with its customers that are satisfied at a point in time and over time. The disaggregation of the Company's revenue based off timing of recognition is as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Products, transferred point in time 59 % 58 % 61 % Products, transferred over time 14 17 15 Net product sales 73 75 76 Services, transferred point in time 8 8 8 Services, transferred over time 19 17 16 Net service sales 27 25 24 Net sales 100 % 100 % 100 % CONTRACT BALANCES The Company records progress on satisfying performance obligations under contracts with customers and the related billings and cash collections are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet in Accounts receivable—net and Other assets (unbilled receivables (contract assets) and billed receivables) and Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities (customer advances and deposits (contract liabilities)). Unbilled receivables (contract assets) arise when the timing of cash collected from customers differs from the timing of revenue recognition, such as when contract provisions require specific milestones to be met before a customer can be billed. Contract assets are recognized when the revenue associated with the contract is recognized prior to billing and derecognized when billed in accordance with the terms of the contract. Contract liabilities are recorded when customers remit contractual cash payments in advance of us satisfying performance obligations under contractual arrangements, including those with performance obligations to be satisfied over a period of time. Contract liabilities are derecognized when revenue is recorded, either when a milestone is met triggering the contractual right to bill or when the performance obligation is satisfied. Contract balances are classified as assets or liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. 64 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) The following table summarizes the Company's contract assets and liabilities balances: 2022 2021 Contract assets—January 1 $ 2,060 $ 1,618 Contract assets—December 31 2,294 2,060 Change in contract assets—increase (decrease) $ 234 $ 442 Contract liabilities—January 1 $ ( 4,290 ) $ ( 4,033 ) Contract liabilities—December 31 ( 4,583 ) ( 4,290 ) Change in contract liabilities—(increase) decrease $ ( 293 ) $ ( 257 ) Net change $ ( 59 ) $ 185 The net change in 2022 and 2021 was primarily driven by the receipt of advance payments from customers exceeding recognition of revenue as performance obligations were satisfied prior to billing. For the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company recognized revenue of $ 1,838 million and $ 1,925 million, respectively, that was previously included in the beginning balance of contract liabilities. Contract assets include $ 2,265 million and $ 2,035 million of unbilled balances under long-term contracts as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. These amounts are billed in accordance with the terms of customer contracts to which they relate. When contracts are modified to account for changes in contract specifications and requirements, the Company considers whether the modification either creates new or changes the existing enforceable rights and obligations. Contract modifications for goods or services and not distinct from the existing contract, due to the significant integration with the original good or service provided, are accounted for as if they were part of that existing contract. The effect of a contract modification on the transaction price and the Company's measure of progress for the performance obligation to which it relates, is recognized as an adjustment to revenue (either as an increase in or a reduction of revenue) on a cumulative catch-up basis. When the modifications include additional performance obligations that are distinct and at relative stand-alone selling price, they are accounted for as a new contract and performance obligation, which are recognized prospectively. PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is defined as the unit of account. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. When the Company's contracts with customers require highly complex integration or manufacturing services that are not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts and, therefore, not distinct, then the entire contract is accounted for as a single performance obligation. In situations when the Company's contracts includes distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer over time, they are recognized as a series of distinct goods or services. For any contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated relative stand-alone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. For product sales, each product sold to a customer typically represents a distinct performance obligation. In such cases, the observable stand-alone sales are used to determine the stand-alone selling price. Performance obligations are satisfied as of a point in time or over time. Performance obligations are supported by contracts with customers, providing a framework for the nature of the distinct goods, services or bundle of goods and services. The timing of satisfying the performance obligation is typically indicated by the terms of the contract. The following table outlines the Company's remaining performance obligations disaggregated by reportable business segment: December 31, 2022 Aerospace $ 11,607 Honeywell Building Technologies 6,991 Performance Materials and Technologies 8,111 Safety and Productivity Solutions 2,844 Corporate and All Other (1) 5 Total performance obligations (2) $ 29,558 (1) The remaining performance obligations within Corporate and All Other relate to the Quantinuum business. (2) Effective March 31, 2022, performance obligations excludes contracts with customers related to Russia as collectability is not reasonably assured. 65 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) Performance obligations recognized as of December 31, 2022, will be satisfied over the course of future periods. The Company's disclosure of the timing for satisfying the performance obligation is based on the requirements of contracts with customers. However, from time to time, these contracts may be subject to modifications, impacting the timing of satisfying the performance obligations. Performance obligations expected to be satisfied within one year and greater than one year are 62 % and 38 %, respectively. The timing of satisfaction of the Company's performance obligations does not significantly vary from the typical timing of payment. Typical payment terms of the Company's fixed-price over time contracts include progress payments based on specified events or milestones, or based on project progress. For some contracts the Company may be entitled to receive an advance payment. The Company applied the practical expedient for certain revenue streams to exclude the value of remaining performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected term of one year or less or (ii) contracts for which the Company recognizes revenue in proportion to the amount the Company has the right to invoice for services performed.

TABLE OF CONTENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) In 2022, the Company recognized repositioning charges totaling $ 420 million, including severance costs of $ 122 million related to workforce reductions of 4,345 manufacturing and administrative positions mainly in the Company's Safety and Productivity Solutions reportable business segment. The workforce reductions related to our productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives. The repositioning charges included asset impairments of $ 176 million related to the write-down of certain manufacturing and other equipment, primarily related to closing and relocating the production of certain respiratory manufacturing from a U.S.-based facility to a non-U.S. facility in the Company's Safety and Productivity Solutions reportable business segment. The repositioning charges included exit costs of $ 122 million related to current period costs incurred for closure obligations associated with site transitions in the Company's Performance Materials and Technologies and Aerospace reportable business segments. Also, $ 56 million of previously established reserves, primarily for severance, were returned to income due to higher than expected voluntary exits and adjustments to the scope of previously announced repositioning actions. In 2021, the Company recognized repositioning charges totaling $ 331 million, including severance costs of $ 80 million related to workforce reductions of 6,432 manufacturing and administrative positions mainly in the Company's Safety and Productivity Solutions and Aerospace reportable business segments. The workforce reductions were primarily related to the realignment of a product line in the Company's Safety and Productivity Solutions reportable business segment, site transitions, mainly in the Aerospace reportable business segment, to more cost-effective locations, and the Company's productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives. The repositioning charges included asset impairments of $ 117 million primarily related to the write-down of certain manufacturing and other equipment. The repositioning charges included exit costs of $ 134 million primarily for current period exit costs incurred for previously approved repositioning projects, closure obligations associated with site transitions, and lease obligations for equipment. Also, $ 13 million of previously established reserves, primarily for severance, were returned to income due to adjustments to the scope of previously announced repositioning actions. In 2020, the Company recognized repositioning charges totaling $ 565 million, including severance costs of $ 475 million related to workforce reductions of 14,159 manufacturing and administrative positions across the Company's reportable business segments, with a majority of the workforce reductions in the Aerospace and Performance Materials and Technologies reportable business segments. The workforce reductions primarily related to the Company aligning its cost structure with the slowdown in demand for many of its products and services due to the global recession, the Company's productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives, and site consolidations and hub strategies. The repositioning charges included exit costs of $ 69 million primarily related to current period exit costs incurred for previously approved repositioning projects. Also, $ 47 million of previously established reserves, primarily for severance, were returned to income mainly as a result of higher attrition than anticipated in prior severance actions resulting in lower payments. 67 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) The following table summarizes the status of the Company's total repositioning reserves: Severance Costs Asset Impairments Exit Costs Total Balance at December 31, 2019 $ 555 $ — $ 96 $ 651 Charges 475 21 69 565 Usage—cash ( 474 ) — ( 90 ) ( 564 ) Usage—noncash — ( 21 ) — ( 21 ) Divestitures — — — — Adjustments ( 44 ) — ( 3 ) ( 47 ) Foreign currency translation 15 — 2 17 Balance at December 31, 2020 527 — 74 601 Charges 80 117 134 331 Usage—cash ( 299 ) — ( 83 ) ( 382 ) Usage—noncash — ( 119 ) — ( 119 ) Divestitures — — — — Adjustments ( 14 ) 2 ( 1 ) ( 13 ) Foreign currency translation ( 5 ) — ( 2 ) ( 7 ) Balance at December 31, 2021 289 — 122 411 Charges 122 176 122 420 Usage—cash ( 135 ) — ( 140 ) ( 275 ) Usage—noncash — ( 168 ) ( 15 ) ( 183 ) Divestitures — — — — Adjustments ( 42 ) ( 8 ) ( 6 ) ( 56 ) Foreign currency translation 1 — ( 9 ) ( 8 ) Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 235 $ — $ 74 $ 309 Certain repositioning projects will recognize exit costs in future periods when the actual liability is incurred. Such exit costs incurred in 2022, 2021, and 2020 were not significant. During 2022, the Company recognized $ 342 million of Asbestos-related charges, net of insurance and reimbursements related to the North American Refractories Company (NARCO) Buyout and HarbisonWalker International Holdings, Inc. (HWI) Sale. See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies for further discussion NARCO asbestos-related liabilities. The Company recognized $ 295 million of Other charges related to the initial suspension (the Suspension) and the Wind down of our business and operations in Russia. These costs impacted all reportable business segments, with the most significant impact within the Performance Materials and Technologies reportable business segment. The Other charges include costs recorded in Cost of products sold, Selling, general and administrative expenses, or Other (income) expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Cost of products and services sold includes $ 65 million primarily related to inventory reserves and the write-down of other assets, Selling, general and administrative includes $ 185 million primarily related to reserves against outstanding accounts receivable and contract assets, impairment of intangible assets, the write-down of other assets, and employee severance, and Other (income) expense includes $ 45 million related to foreign exchange revaluation on an intercompany loan with a Russian affiliate, impairment of property, plant and equipment, and expenses for called guarantees. Directly attributable to our Wind down of businesses and operations in Russia, but excluded from Other charges, is a $ 2 million tax valuation allowance recorded to Tax expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Given the uncertainty inherent in the Company's remaining obligations related to contracts with Russian counterparties, the Company does not believe it is possible to develop estimates of reasonably possible loss in excess of current accruals for these matters (other than as specifically set forth above). Based on available information to date, the Company’s estimate of potential future losses or other contingencies related to Suspension and Wind down activities, including any guarantee payments or any litigation costs or as otherwise related to the Company's Wind down in Russia, could adversely affect the Company's consolidated results of operations in the periods recognized but would not be material with respect to the Company's consolidated financial position. See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies for a discussion of the recognition and measurement of estimate for contingencies. 68 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) Additionally, for the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, Other charges include $ 41 million and $ 105 million, respectively, of incremental long-term contract labor cost inefficiencies due to severe supply chain disruptions (attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic) relating to the warehouse automation business within the Safety and Productivity Solutions reportable business segment. Certain of these costs incurred include amounts and provisions for anticipated losses recognized during 2022 and 2021 when total estimated costs at completion for certain of the business’ long-term contracts exceeded total estimated revenue. These costs represent unproductive labor costs due to unexpected supply delays and the resulting downstream installation issues, demobilization and remobilization of contract workers, and resolution of contractor disputes. These costs do not include normal operational inefficiencies experienced during a challenging operating environment in 2022 and 2021. NOTE 5.

TABLE OF CONTENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 The U.S. federal statutory income tax rate is reconciled to the effective income tax rate as follows: U.S. federal statutory income tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 % Taxes on non-U.S. earnings (1)(2) ( 0.4 ) ( 1.4 ) ( 0.8 ) U.S. state income taxes (1) 1.4 1.5 1.3 Reserves for tax contingencies 1.1 2.2 ( 2.6 ) Employee share-based payments ( 0.9 ) ( 0.7 ) ( 1.2 ) Reduction of certain receivables — — 2.0 Restructuring 0.7 ( 1.4 ) — U.S. Valuation Allowance ( 0.2 ) 2.0 0.1 All other items—net ( 0.6 ) ( 0.7 ) ( 0.7 ) 22.1 % 22.5 % 19.1 % (1) Net of changes in valuation allowance. (2) Includes U.S. taxes on non-U.S. earnings. The effective tax rate decreased by 0.4 percentage points in 2022 compared to 2021. The decrease was primarily a result of additional tax expense reported in 2021 arising from a valuation allowance established against a capital loss, partially offset by a tax benefit related to restructuring transactions. In 2022, the valuation allowance was partially released as losses were utilized against a capital gain. Additionally, in 2022, there was lower tax expense reported for contingencies as a result of the release of certain state income tax reserves The Company’s non-U.S. effective tax rate was 27.5 %, an increase of approximately 1.5 percentage points compared to 2021. The increase in the non-U.S. effective tax rate was primarily attributable to a 2021 tax benefit recorded for the release of a valuation allowance on net operating losses due to restructuring in Canada, which resulted in more tax expense in 2022 compared to 2021. This increase was partially offset by lower tax expense recorded in 2022 related to tax reserves when compared to 2021. The effective tax rate increased by 3.4 percentage points in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to the establishment of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets not expected to be realized, incremental tax reserves, a lower tax benefit from restructuring, and the absence of prior year items including tax benefits realized as a result of the favorable resolution of a foreign tax matter related to the spin-off transactions, tax law changes in India, and the resolution of certain U.S. tax matters offset by a non-cash charge related to the reduction of the aggregate carrying value of certain receivables with no corresponding tax benefit. The Company’s non-U.S. effective tax rate was 26.0 %, an increase of approximately 14.1 percentage points compared to 2020. The increase in the non-U.S. effective tax rate was primarily attributable to incremental tax reserves, the tax impact of restructuring and the absence of prior year items including the favorable resolution of a foreign tax matter related to the previously completed spin-off transactions, and tax law changes in India. 70 Honeywell International Inc.

The Company maintains a valuation allowance of $ 683 million against a portion of the non-U.S. gross deferred tax assets. Additionally, a valuation allowance of $ 129 million is maintained against the U.S. gross deferred tax asset primarily related to capital loss carryovers. The change in the valuation allowance resulted in a decrease of $ 8 million, an increase of $ 124 million, and an increase of $ 105 million to income tax expense in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. In the event the Company determines that it will not be able to realize its net deferred tax assets in the future, the Company will reduce such amounts through an increase to income tax expense in the period such determination is made. Conversely, if the Company determines that it will be able to realize net deferred tax assets in excess of the carrying amounts, the Company will decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a reduction to income tax expense in the period that such determination is made. As of December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a $ 517 million deferred tax liability on all unremitted foreign earnings based on estimated earnings and profits of approximately $ 17 billion as of the balance sheet date. As of December 31, 2022, the Company's net operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards were as follows: Jurisdiction Expiration Period Net Operating and Capital Loss Carryforwards Tax Credit Carryforwards U.S. Federal 2042 $ 584 $ 94 U.S. State 2042 449 21 Non-U.S. 2042 450 53 Non-U.S. Indefinite 2,062 — $ 3,545 $ 168 71 Honeywell International Inc.

Based on the outcome of these examinations, or as a result of the expiration of statute of limitations for specific jurisdictions, it is reasonably possible that certain unrecognized tax benefits for tax positions taken on previously filed tax returns will materially change from those recorded as liabilities in the Company's financial statements. In addition, the outcome of these examinations may impact the valuation of certain deferred tax assets (such as net operating losses) in future periods. Unrecognized tax benefits for examinations in progress were $ 640 million, $ 592 million, and $ 556 million, as of December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Estimated interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes are classified as a component of Tax expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and totaled $ 5 million, $ 79 million, and $ 80 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING TRANSACTIONS DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its risks related to interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and commodity prices. Derivative financial instruments are not used for trading or other speculative purposes. To qualify as a hedge, derivative financial instruments must be evaluated for hedge effectiveness at the inception of the contract and designated as a hedge. Changes in fair value of the derivative contract must be highly correlated with changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item at inception and over the life of the hedge contract. FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT The Company operates a global business in a wide variety of foreign currencies. The Company's exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries, foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, and transactions arising from international trade. The Company's objective is to preserve the U.S. Dollar value of foreign currency denominated cash flows and earnings. The Company monitors its collective foreign currency exposure and enters into foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts (foreign currency exchange contracts) with third parties, when necessary, to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company has monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Prior to conversion into U.S. Dollars, these assets and liabilities are remeasured at spot exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. The effects of changes in spot rates are recognized in earnings and included in Other (income) expense. The Company uses foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge its foreign currency exposure. These contracts are marked-to-market with the resulting gains and losses recognized in earnings offsetting the gains and losses on the non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities being hedged. The Company uses foreign currency contracts to hedge forecasted sales and purchases, which are denominated in non-functional currencies. Changes in the forecasted non-functional currency cash flows due to movements in exchange rates are substantially offset by changes in the fair value of these foreign currency exchange contracts designated as hedges. Market value gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in earnings when the hedged transaction is recognized. As of December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company held contracts with notional amounts of $ 10,545 million and $ 12,671 million, respectively, to exchange foreign currencies, principally the U.S. Dollar, Euro, Canadian Dollar, British Pound, Mexican Peso, Chinese Renminbi, and Indian Rupee. The Company also designates certain foreign currency debt and derivative contracts as hedges against portions of its net investment in foreign operations. Gains or losses of the foreign currency debt and derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges are recorded in the same manner as foreign currency translation adjustments. INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose the Company to market risk related to changes in interest rates. The Company uses a combination of financial instruments, including long-term, medium-term, and short-term financing, variable-rate commercial paper, and interest rate swaps to convert the interest rate mix of the Company's total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT The Company continues to monitor the creditworthiness of its counterparties to mitigate the risk of nonperformance. Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose the Company to counterparty credit risk. In addition, the Company grants credit terms to its customers in the normal course of business. The terms and conditions of the Company's credit sales are designed to mitigate or eliminate concentrations of credit risk with any single customer. The Company's sales are not materially dependent on a single customer or a small group of customers. COMMODITY PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT The Company's operations subject us to risk related to the price volatility of certain commodities. To mitigate the commodity price risk associated with the Company's operations, the Company may enter into commodity derivative instruments. In March 2022, the Company entered into various contracts to mitigate commodity price volatility. The Company elected to apply hedge accounting to these contracts. 79 Honeywell International Inc.

In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of the Company's foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges. The carrying value of those debt instruments designated as net investment hedges, which includes the adjustment for the foreign currency transaction gain or loss on those instruments, was $ 3,836 million and $ 4,074 million as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. Interest rate swap agreements are designated as hedge relationships with gains or losses on the derivative recognized in Interest and other financial charges offsetting the gains and losses on the underlying debt being hedged. Gains and losses on interest rate swap agreements recognized in earnings were $ 347 million of expense, $ 135 million of expense, and $ 169 million of income for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy. • Level 1 - Inputs are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. • Level 2 - Inputs are based on observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical or similar assets and liabilities. • Level 3 - One or more inputs are unobservable and significant. Financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. 82 Honeywell International Inc.

(2016 Directors Plan) were both approved by the shareowners at the Annual Meeting of Shareowners effective on April 25, 2016. At December 31, 2022, there were 30,635,612 , and 797,252 shares of Honeywell common stock available for future grants under terms of the 2016 Plan and 2016 Directors Plan, respectively. STOCK OPTIONS The exercise price, term, and other conditions applicable to each option granted under the Company's stock plans are generally determined by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The exercise price of stock options is set on the grant date and may not be less than the fair market value per share of the Company's stock on that date. The fair value is recognized as an expense over the employee’s requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the award). Options generally vest over a four -year period and expire after ten years . The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on our common stock and historical volatility of the Company's common stock. The Company used a Monte Carlo simulation model to derive an expected term which represents an estimate of the time options are expected to remain outstanding. Such model uses historical data to estimate option exercise activity and post-vest termination behavior. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

Approximately $ 2.9 billion and $ 7.1 billion remained available as of December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively, for additional share repurchases. Honeywell repurchased approximately 21.9 million and 15.8 million shares of its common stock during the years ended December 31, 2022, and 2021, for $ 4.2 billion and $ 3.4 billion, respectively. The Company is authorized to issue up to 40,000,000 shares of preferred stock, without par value, and can determine the number of shares of each series, and the rights, preferences, and limitations of each series. At December 31, 2022, there was no preferred stock outstanding. 91 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The Company is subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign government requirements relating to the protection of the environment. The Company believes that, as a general matter, the Company's policies, practices, and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that the handling, manufacture, use, and disposal of hazardous substances are in accordance with environmental and safety laws and regulations. However, mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, the Company, like other companies engaged in similar businesses, incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and is a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims, and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. With respect to environmental matters involving site contamination, the Company continually conducts studies, individually or jointly with other potentially responsible parties, to determine the feasibility of various remedial techniques. It is the Company's policy to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters when remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work. The recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical, regulatory, or legal information becomes available. Given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws, regulations, enforcement policies, the impact of other potentially responsible parties, technology, and information related to individual sites, the Company does not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of the Company's recorded liabilities. The Company expects to fund expenditures for these matters from operating cash flow. The timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of factors, including the timing of remedial investigations and feasibility studies, the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, remedial techniques to be utilized, and agreements with other parties. The following table summarizes information concerning the Company's recorded liabilities for environmental costs: Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Beginning of year $ 618 $ 660 $ 709 Accruals for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable 186 168 173 Environmental liability payments ( 211 ) ( 210 ) ( 216 ) Other 22 — ( 6 ) End of year $ 615 $ 618 $ 660 Environmental liabilities are included in the following balance sheet accounts: December 31, 2022 2021 Accrued liabilities $ 222 $ 225 Other liabilities 393 393 $ 615 $ 618 The Company does not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of environmental liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies, litigation, or settlements, and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined, although they could be material to the Company's consolidated results of operations and operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid. However, considering the Company's past experience and existing reserves, the Company does not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position. In conjunction with the Resideo spin-off, the Company entered into an indemnification and reimbursement agreement with a Resideo subsidiary, pursuant to which Resideo’s subsidiary has an ongoing obligation to make cash payments to Honeywell in amounts equal to 90 % of Honeywell’s annual net spending for environmental matters at certain sites as defined in the agreement. The amount payable to Honeywell in any given year is subject to a cap of $ 140 million, and the obligation will continue until the earlier of December 31, 2043, or December 31 of the third consecutive year during which the annual payment obligation is less than $ 25 million. 92 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) Reimbursements associated with this agreement are collected from Resideo quarterly and were $ 140 million in both 2022 and 2021 and offset operating cash outflows incurred by the Company. As the Company incurs costs for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable related to the sites covered by the indemnification and reimbursement agreement, a corresponding receivable from Resideo for 90 % of such costs is also recorded. This receivable amount recorded in 2022 and 2021 was $ 157 million and $ 146 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2022, Other current assets and Other assets included $ 140 million and $ 474 million, respectively, for the short-term and long-term portion of the receivable amount due from Resideo under the indemnification and reimbursement agreement. As of December 31, 2021, Other current assets and Other assets included $ 140 million and $ 457 million, respectively, for the short-term and long-term portion of the receivable amount due from Resideo under the indemnification and reimbursement agreement. ASBESTOS MATTERS Honeywell is named in asbestos-related personal injury claims related to NARCO, which was sold in 1986, and the Bendix Friction Materials (Bendix) business, which was sold in 2014. The following tables summarize information concerning NARCO and Bendix asbestos-related balances: ASBESTOS-RELATED LIABILITIES Year Ended December 31, 2022 Year Ended December 31, 2021 Year Ended December 31, 2020 Bendix NARCO Total Bendix NARCO Total Bendix NARCO Total Beginning of year $ 1,372 $ 689 $ 2,061 $ 1,441 $ 779 $ 2,220 $ 1,499 $ 858 $ 2,357 Accrual for update to estimated liability 93 ( 634 ) ( 541 ) 64 31 95 80 18 98 Change in estimated cost of future claims 41 — 41 29 — 29 42 — 42 Update of expected resolution values for pending claims 1 — 1 3 — 3 10 — 10 Asbestos-related liability payments ( 216 ) ( 55 ) ( 271 ) ( 165 ) ( 121 ) ( 286 ) ( 190 ) ( 97 ) ( 287 ) NARCO Buyout — 1,325 1,325 — — — — — — End of year $ 1,291 $ 1,325 $ 2,616 $ 1,372 $ 689 $ 2,061 $ 1,441 $ 779 $ 2,220 INSURANCE RECOVERIES FOR ASBESTOS-RELATED LIABILITIES Year Ended December 31, 2022 Year Ended December 31, 2021 Year Ended December 31, 2020 Bendix NARCO Total Bendix NARCO Total Bendix NARCO Total Beginning of year $ 142 $ 221 $ 363 $ 148 $ 254 $ 402 $ 153 $ 281 $ 434 Probable insurance recoveries related to estimated liability 5 2 7 7 — 7 10 — 10 Insurance receipts for asbestos-related liabilities ( 17 ) ( 20 ) ( 37 ) ( 13 ) ( 33 ) ( 46 ) ( 33 ) ( 25 ) ( 58 ) Insurance receivables settlements and write-offs — ( 68 ) ( 68 ) — — — 18 ( 2 ) 16 End of year $ 130 $ 135 $ 265 $ 142 $ 221 $ 363 $ 148 $ 254 $ 402 NARCO and Bendix asbestos-related balances are included in the following balance sheet accounts: December 31, 2022 2021 Other current assets $ 41 $ 41 Insurance recoveries for asbestos-related liabilities 224 322 $ 265 $ 363 Accrued liabilities $ 1,436 $ 261 Asbestos-related liabilities 1,180 1,800 $ 2,616 $ 2,061 93 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) NARCO Products – NARCO manufactured high-grade, heat-resistant, refractory products for various industries. Honeywell’s predecessor, Allied Corporation, owned NARCO from 1979 to 1986. Allied Corporation sold the NARCO business in 1986 and entered into a cross-indemnity agreement which included an obligation to indemnify the purchaser for asbestos claims, arising primarily from alleged occupational exposure to asbestos-containing refractory brick and mortar for high-temperature applications. NARCO ceased manufacturing these products in 1980 and filed for bankruptcy in January 2002, at which point in time all then current and future NARCO asbestos claims were stayed against both NARCO and Honeywell pending the reorganization of NARCO. The Company established its initial liability for NARCO asbestos claims in 2002. NARCO emerged from bankruptcy in April 2013, at which time a federally authorized 524(g) trust was established to evaluate and resolve all existing NARCO asbestos claims (the Trust). Both Honeywell and NARCO are protected by a permanent channeling injunction barring all present and future individual actions in state or federal courts and requiring all asbestos-related claims based on exposure to NARCO asbestos-containing products to be made against the Trust (Channeling Injunction). The NARCO Trust Agreement (TA) and the NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures (TDP) set forth the structure and operating rules of the Trust, and established Honeywell’s evergreen funding obligations. The operating rules per the TDP define criteria claimants must meet for a claim to be considered valid and paid. Once operational in 2014, the Trust began to receive, process, and pay claims. In September 2021, Honeywell filed suit against the Trust in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania (Bankruptcy Court) alleging that the Trust breached its duties in managing the Trust, including breaches of certain provisions of the TA and TDP. Honeywell's lawsuit sought appropriate relief preventing the Trust from continuing these practices. The Trust also filed suit against Honeywell, alleging Honeywell breached its obligations under the Trust's governing documents. Honeywell moved to dismiss the Trust’s suit, and on December 15, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court granted Honeywell’s motion to dismiss subject to granting the Trust leave to file an amended complaint. On December 28, 2021, the Trust filed an answer with counterclaims in response to Honeywell’s complaint and in lieu of filing an amended complaint. The Bankruptcy Court conducted a trial on these matters during May 2022; following the trial, the Company and the Trust began discussing a potential settlement of Honeywell’s remaining obligations to the Trust. On November 18, 2022, Honeywell entered into a definitive agreement (Buyout Agreement) with the Trust, and on November 20, 2022, in exchange for the NARCO Trust Advisory Committee (TAC) and Lawrence Fitzpatrick, in his capacity as the NARCO Asbestos Future Claimants Representative (FCR), becoming parties to the Buyout Agreement, Honeywell, the Trust, the TAC, and the FCR entered into an Amended and Restated Buyout Agreement (Amended Buyout Agreement). Pursuant to the terms of the Amended Buyout Agreement, Honeywell agreed to make a one-time, lump sum payment in the amount of $ 1.325 billion to the Trust (Buyout Amount), subject to certain deductions as described in the Amended Buyout Agreement and in exchange for the release by the Trust of Honeywell from all further and future obligations of any kind related to the Trust and/or any claimants who were exposed to asbestos-containing products manufactured, sold, or distributed by NARCO or its predecessors, including Honeywell’s ongoing evergreen obligation to fund (i) claims against the Trust, which comprise Honeywell’s NARCO asbestos-related claims liability, and (ii) the Trust’s annual operating expenses, which are expensed as incurred, including its legal fees (which operating expenses, for reference, were approximately $ 30 million in 2022) (such evergreen obligations referred to in (i) and (ii), Honeywell Obligations) (the NARCO Buyout). On December 8, 2022, the Bankruptcy Court issued an order that (A) approved the Amended Buyout Agreement, and (B) declared that the NARCO Channeling Injunction (which bars all past, present, and future individual actions in state or federal courts based on exposure to NARCO asbestos-containing products and requires all such claims to be made against the Trust) will remain in full force and effect without modification, dissolution, or termination (Order). On December 14, 2022, HWI, the reorganized and renamed entity that emerged from the NARCO bankruptcy, entered into a definitive agreement (Sale Agreement) pursuant to which an affiliate of Platinum Equity, LLC will acquire HWI (HWI Sale) subject to the terms set forth in the Sale Agreement, including customary conditions to closing set forth therein. In accordance with the Amended Buyout Agreement, the economic rights of the Trust in respect of the net proceeds from the HWI Sale inure to the benefit of Honeywell. On January 30, 2023, the Company paid the Buyout Amount to the Trust, the parties closed the transactions contemplated in the Amended Buyout Agreement (Closing), and Honeywell was released from the Honeywell Obligations. Honeywell continues to have the right to collect proceeds in connection with its NARCO asbestos-related insurance policies. With the issuance of the Order, the Company derecognized the NARCO asbestos-related liability of $ 688 million from the Consolidated Balance Sheet and recognized a charge of $ 1.325 billion in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and accrued a corresponding liability in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for the Buyout Amount. In addition, the Company recognized a benefit of $ 295 million in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and corresponding asset in Other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet for Honeywell's rights to the proceeds from the HWI Sale. The benefit of $ 295 million offset the charge for the Buyout Amount. 94 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) Bendix Products – Bendix manufactured automotive brake linings that contained chrysotile asbestos in an encapsulated form. Claimants consist largely of individuals who allege exposure to asbestos from brakes from either performing or being in the vicinity of individuals who performed brake replacements. The following tables present information regarding Bendix related asbestos claims activity: Claims activity Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Claims unresolved at the beginning of year 6,401 6,242 Claims filed 2,014 2,611 Claims resolved ( 2,807 ) ( 2,452 ) Claims unresolved at the end of year 5,608 6,401 Disease distribution of unresolved claims Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Mesothelioma and other cancer claims 3,283 3,760 Nonmalignant claims 2,325 2,641 Total claims 5,608 6,401 Honeywell has experienced average resolution values per claim excluding legal costs as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 (in whole dollars) Malignant claims $ 59,200 $ 56,000 $ 61,500 $ 50,200 $ 55,300 Nonmalignant claims $ 520 $ 400 $ 550 $ 3,900 $ 4,700 It is not possible to predict whether resolution values for Bendix-related asbestos claims will increase, decrease, or stabilize in the future. The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect an estimated liability for resolution of asserted (claims filed as of the financial statement date) and unasserted Bendix-related asbestos claims, which exclude the Company’s ongoing legal fees to defend such asbestos claims which will continue to be expensed as they are incurred. The Company reflects the inclusion of all years of epidemiological disease projection through 2059 when estimating the liability for unasserted Bendix-related asbestos claims. Such liability for unasserted Bendix-related asbestos claims is based on historic and anticipated claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. The Company valued Bendix asserted and unasserted claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. The Company updates the resolution values used to estimate the cost of Bendix asserted and unasserted claims during the fourth quarter each year. The Company's insurance receivable corresponding to the liability for settlement of asserted and unasserted Bendix asbestos claims reflects coverage which is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market. Based on the Company's ongoing analysis of the probable insurance recovery, insurance receivables are recorded in the financial statements simultaneous with the recording of the estimated liability for the underlying asbestos claims. This determination is based on the Company's analysis of the underlying insurance policies, historical experience with insurers, ongoing review of the solvency of insurers, judicial determinations relevant to insurance programs, and consideration of the impacts of any settlements reached with the Company's insurers. On October 31, 2018, David Kanefsky (Plaintiff), a Honeywell shareholder, filed a putative class action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey (the Court) alleging violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 related to the prior accounting for Bendix asbestos claims. An Amended Complaint was filed on December 30, 2019, and on February 7, 2020, the Company filed a Motion to Dismiss. On May 18, 2020, the Court denied the Motion to Dismiss. On December 7, 2021, the parties filed a Stipulation of Settlement (Settlement Agreement) and Plaintiff filed a motion for preliminary approval of the Settlement Agreement, which included payment by Honeywell of $ 10 million to settle the claims in dispute. On January 18, 2022, the Court approved the motion for preliminary approval of the Settlement Agreement. On May 3, 2022, the Court entered a final judgment and order approving the Settlement Agreement and dismissed the action. Honeywell continues to believe the claims lacked merit and has denied wrongdoing as well as any liability for the claims made against Honeywell in the action. 95 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) GARRETT LITIGATION AND BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS In conjunction with the Garrett spin-off, the Company entered into a binding indemnification and reimbursement agreement (Garrett Indemnity) and a binding tax matters agreement (Tax Matters Agreement) with Garrett and a Garrett subsidiary. On December 2, 2019, Garrett and Garrett ASASCO Inc. filed a Summons with Notice and commenced a lawsuit in the Commercial Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York (the State Court), seeking to invalidate the Garrett Indemnity. Garrett sought damages and a declaratory judgment based on various claims set forth in the Summons with Notice. On July 17, 2020, the Company received a notice from Garrett asserting that the Company had caused material breaches of the Tax Matters Agreement and that the Tax Matters Agreement was unenforceable. On September 20, 2020, Garrett and 36 of its affiliates filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the Bankruptcy Court). On September 24, 2020, Garrett moved the existing State Court litigation against Honeywell to the Bankruptcy Court. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company reviewed the aggregate carrying value of the receivable amounts due in connection with the Garrett Indemnity and Tax Matters Agreement and reduced the aggregate carrying value of the receivable by $ 509 million to reflect the present value of the amounts owed to the Company over the full term of these agreements. On April 26, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed Garrett’s amended Chapter 11 plan of reorganization (the Confirmed Plan), and on April 30, 2021 (the Effective Date), Garrett emerged from bankruptcy. On the Effective Date, and in accordance with the Confirmed Plan, (i) the Company received from Garrett an initial payment of $ 375 million and 834.8 million shares of Garrett's Series B Preferred Stock in full and final satisfaction of the Garrett Indemnity and Tax Matters Agreement, (ii) the Garrett Indemnity and Tax Matters Agreement were terminated, (iii) the Company and Garrett mutually released each other from the claims asserted in all pending legal actions related to the Garrett Indemnity and Tax Matters Agreement, and (iv) all pending litigation between the Company and Garrett in connection with those agreements was resolved. The original Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation provided for mandatory redemptions by Garrett of $ 35 million in 2022 and $ 100 million per year from 2023 to 2030 (inclusive) at the anniversary of the Effective Date, unless (i) Garrett’s consolidated EBITDA as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal year was less than $ 425 million, or (ii) Garrett did not have sufficient funds available to pay the redemption, at which point the redemption amounts past due would accrue interest. The Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation also included rights which allowed (a) the Company to put the Series B Preferred Stock to Garrett if certain EBITDA conditions were met, and (b) Garrett to call the Series B Preferred Stock in whole or in part if certain EBITDA conditions were met. On September 30, 2021, Garrett filed an Amended and Restated Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation (Amendment) with the Secretary of State of Delaware. The Amendment required Garrett to partially redeem a portion of the Series B Preferred Stock on or before March 31, 2022, such that the present value of remaining outstanding shares of the Series B Preferred Stock would be $ 400 million (First Partial Redemption), subject to applicable law, including that Garrett had funds legally available for the partial redemption. The First Partial Redemption would be applied to the latest scheduled redemption dates, beginning with the shares to be redeemed in 2030. The Amendment also provided that the Company could not exercise its right to put the Series B Preferred Stock to Garrett until after December 31, 2022, subject to the EBITDA conditions described in the above section, unless the partial redemption did not occur on or before March 31, 2022. All other material terms and conditions in the Amendment were unchanged from the original Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation. On December 16, 2021, Garrett filed a Second Amended and Restated Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation (Second Amendment) with the Secretary of State of Delaware. The Second Amendment accelerated the First Partial Redemption from March 31, 2022, to December 30, 2021, and allowed Garrett to partially redeem an additional portion of the Series B Preferred Stock on or before March 31, 2022, such that the present value of remaining outstanding shares of the Series B Preferred Stock would be $ 207 million (Second Partial Redemption). The Second Partial Redemption is subject to similar terms as the First Partial Redemption, including that Garrett had funds legally available for the partial redemption. However, the Second Partial Redemption was also contingent upon Garrett completing the First Partial Redemption and either (i) increasing their revolving credit facility, or (ii) the Garrett Board of Directors determining that Garrett otherwise had sufficient liquidity to effect the Second Partial Redemption. The Second Partial Redemption would be applied to the earliest scheduled redemptions beginning with the shares to be redeemed on April 30, 2022. On December 17, 2021, Garrett announced their intention to effect the First Partial Redemption on December 28, 2021, in the amount of $ 211 million. On December 28, 2021, Garrett paid $ 211 million for the amount due as the First Partial Redemption. On February 18, 2022, Garrett early redeemed $ 197 million of the Series B Preferred Stock, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Second Amended and Restated Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation. Immediately following the early redemption, the fair value of the Series B Preferred Stock was $ 207 million. On June 28, 2022, Garrett early redeemed all remaining shares of the Series B Preferred Stock in the amount of $ 212 million, pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Second Amended and Restated Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation. Following the redemption, the Series B Preferred Stock were no longer outstanding. 96 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) The Company recorded the Series B Preferred Stock at fair value at the Effective Date. See Note 12 Fair Value Measurements for additional information on the fair value leveling of the Series B Preferred Stock. PETROBRAS AND UNAOIL MATTERS On December 19, 2022, the Company reached a comprehensive resolution to the investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and certain Brazilian authorities (Brazilian Authorities) relating to the Company's use of third parties who previously worked for the Company's UOP business in Brazil in relation to a project awarded in 2010 for Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. (Petrobras). The investigations focused on the Company’s compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar Brazilian laws (UOP Matters). The comprehensive resolution also resolves DOJ and SEC investigations relating to a matter involving a foreign subsidiary’s prior contract with Unaoil S.A.M. in Algeria executed in 2011 (the Unaoil Matter). In connection with the comprehensive resolution, (i) the Company agreed to pay a total equivalent of $ 202.7 million, which payment occurred in January 2023, to the DOJ, the SEC, and the Brazilian Authorities, collectively, in penalties, disgorgement, and prejudgment interest, (ii) the Company’s subsidiary, UOP, LLC (UOP), entered into a three-year Deferred Prosecution Agreement (DPA) with the DOJ for charges related to the UOP Matters, (iii) UOP entered into leniency agreements with the Brazilian authorities related to the UOP Matter in Brazil, and (iv) the Company entered into an agreement with the SEC that resolves allegations relating to the UOP Matters and the Unaoil Matter. Pursuant to these agreements, the Company agreed to undertake certain compliance measures and compliance reporting obligations. These agreements entirely resolve the Petrobras and Unaoil investigations. The Company previously recorded a total of $ 210 million of charges related to these matters in the Consolidated Statement of Operations, and accrued a corresponding reserve on its Consolidated Balance Sheet. Following the resolution, in December 2022, the Company reduced its previously recorded reserve to $ 205 million, based on expected payment amounts at that time. 97 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) OTHER MATTERS The Company is subject to a number of other lawsuits, investigations, and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of the Company's business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability, prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, and environmental, health, and safety matters. The Company recognizes liabilities for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. The Company continually assesses the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes in such matters, as well as potential ranges of probable losses (taking into consideration any insurance recoveries), based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Given the uncertainty inherent in litigation and investigations, the Company does not believe it is possible to develop estimates of reasonably possible loss (or a range of possible loss) in excess of current accruals for commitment and contingency matters, including those discussed in this Note 19. Considering the Company's past experience and existing accruals, the Company does not expect the outcome of such matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, potential liabilities are subject to change due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, which could cause the Company to pay damage awards or settlements (or become subject to equitable remedies) that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid. WARRANTIES AND GUARANTEES In the normal course of business, the Company issues product warranties and product performance guarantees. The Company accrues for the estimated cost of product warranties and performance guarantees based on contract terms and historical experience at the time of sale. Adjustments to initial obligations for warranties and guarantees are made as changes to the obligations become reasonably estimable. The following table summarizes information concerning the Company's recorded obligations for product warranties and product performance guarantees: Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 Beginning of year $ 223 $ 243 $ 269 Accruals for warranties/guarantees issued during the year 117 146 164 Adjustment of pre-existing warranties/guarantees ( 12 ) ( 7 ) ( 18 ) Settlement of warranty/guarantee claims ( 115 ) ( 159 ) ( 172 ) End of year $ 213 $ 223 $ 243 Product warranties and product performance guarantees are included in the following balance sheet accounts: December 31, 2022 2021 Accrued liabilities $ 175 $ 180 Other liabilities 38 43 $ 213 $ 223 NOTE 20. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS The Company sponsors a number of both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Pension benefits for many of the Company's U.S. employees are provided through non-contributory, qualified, and non-qualified defined benefit plans. All non-union hourly and salaried employees joining Honeywell for the first time after December 31, 2012, are not eligible to participate in Honeywell’s U.S. defined benefit pension plans. The Company also sponsors defined benefit pension plans which cover non-U.S. employees who are not U.S. citizens, in certain jurisdictions, principally the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and Canada. Other pension plans outside of the U.S. are not material to the Company either individually or in the aggregate. The Company also sponsors postretirement benefit plans that provide health care benefits and life insurance coverage mainly to U.S. eligible retirees. None of Honeywell’s U.S. employees are eligible for a retiree medical subsidy from the Company. In addition, the vast majority of Honeywell’s U.S. retirees either have no Company subsidy or have a fixed-dollar subsidy amount.

TABLE OF CONTENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) Major actuarial assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations and net periodic benefit (income) cost for the Company's significant benefit plans are presented in the following table as weighted averages: Pension Benefits U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 Actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations as of December 31: Discount rate 5.17 % 2.87 % 2.50 % 4.50 % 1.79 % 1.23 % Expected annual rate of compensation increase 3.25 % 3.25 % 3.25 % 2.69 % 2.56 % 2.43 % Actuarial assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit (income) cost for years ended December 31: Discount rate—benefit obligation 2.87 % 2.50 % 3.22 % 1.77 % 1.24 % 1.81 % Discount rate—service cost 2.98 % 2.68 % 3.33 % 1.48 % 1.00 % 1.48 % Discount rate—interest cost 2.26 % 1.76 % 2.76 % 1.59 % 1.00 % 1.56 % Expected rate of return on plan assets 6.40 % 6.15 % 6.15 % 3.61 % 4.03 % 4.66 % Expected annual rate of compensation increase 3.25 % 3.25 % 3.25 % 2.56 % 2.43 % 2.47 % Other Postretirement Benefits 2022 2021 2020 Actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations as of December 31: Discount rate 5.32 % 2.66 % 2.20 % Actuarial assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for years ended December 31: Discount rate (1) 2.66 % 2.20 % 2.36 % (1) Discount rate was 3.03 % for January 1, 2020, through September 30, 2020. The rate was changed to 2.36 % for the remainder of 2020 due to a Plan remeasurement as of October 1, 2020. The discount rate for the Company's U.S. pension and other postretirement benefits plans reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be settled at the measurement date of December 31. To determine discount rates for the Company's U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans, the Company uses a modeling process that involves matching the expected cash outflows of the Company's benefit plans to a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high-quality, fixed income debt instruments. The Company uses the single weighted average yield of this hypothetical portfolio as a discount rate benchmark. The Company utilizes a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension benefit (income) for the Company's significant pension plans. This approach applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the pension benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows and provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected cash flows and their corresponding spot rates. For the Company's U.S. pension plans, the single weighted average spot rates used to determine service and interest costs for 2023 are 5.26 % and 5.07 %, respectively. The discount rate used to determine the other postretirement benefit obligation is higher principally due to a shorter expected duration of other postretirement plan obligations as compared to pension plan obligations. The Company plans to use an expected rate of return on U.S. plan assets of 6.75 % for 2023, which represents an increase from the 6.40 % assumption used for 2022. The Company's asset return assumption is based on historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with current market conditions and broad asset mix considerations with a focus on long-term trends rather than short-term market conditions. The Company reviews the expected rate of return on an annual basis and revise it as appropriate. For non-U.S. benefit plans, actuarial assumptions reflect economic and market factors relevant to each country. 102 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) PENSION BENEFITS The following amounts relate to the Company's significant pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations exceeding the fair value of plan assets: December 31, U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans 2022 2021 2022 2021 Projected benefit obligation $ 255 $ 359 $ 682 $ 964 Accumulated benefit obligation $ 253 $ 346 $ 664 $ 932 Fair value of plan assets $ — $ — $ 230 $ 256 The accumulated benefit obligation for the Company's U.S. defined benefit pension plans was $ 13.3 billion and $ 17.3 billion and for the Company's non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans was $ 4.4 billion and $ 6.9 billion at December 31, 2022, and 2021, respectively. The Company's asset investment strategy for its U.S. pension plans focuses on maintaining a diversified portfolio using various asset classes in order to achieve the Company's long-term investment objectives on a risk adjusted basis. The Company's long-term target allocations are as follows: 45 %- 65 % fixed income securities and cash, 25 %- 40 % equity securities, 5 %- 10 % real estate investments, and 10 %- 20 % other types of investments. Equity securities include publicly-traded stock of companies located inside the United States. Fixed income securities include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, mortgage-backed securities, and U.S. Treasuries. Real estate investments include direct investments in commercial properties and investments in real estate funds. Other types of investments include investments in private equity that follow several different strategies. The Company reviews its assets on a regular basis to ensure that the Company is within the targeted asset allocation ranges and, if necessary, asset balances are adjusted back within target allocations. The Company's non-U.S. pension assets are typically managed by decentralized fiduciary committees with the Honeywell Corporate Investments group providing funding and investment guidance. The Company's non-U.S. investment policies are different for each country as local regulations, funding requirements, and financial and tax considerations are part of the funding and investment allocation process in each country. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820)”, certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value (NAV) per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in the following tables are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented for the total pension benefits plan assets. 103 Honeywell International Inc.

Sufficient cash or cash equivalents are held by the Company's pension plans to cover the notional value of the futures contracts. At December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company's U.S. plans had contracts with notional amounts of $ 2,567 million and $ 4,415 million, respectively. At December 31, 2022, and 2021, the Company's non-U.S. plans had contracts with notional amounts of $ 120 million and $ 311 million, respectively. In both the Company's U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, the notional derivative exposure is related to outstanding equity and fixed income futures contracts. Common stocks, preferred stocks, real estate investment trusts, and short-term investments are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded. Corporate bonds, mortgage/asset-backed securities, and government securities are valued either by using pricing models, bids provided by brokers or dealers, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics, or discounted cash flows, and as such, include adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks. Certain securities are held in collective trust funds which are valued using net asset values provided by the administrators of the funds. Investments in private equity, debt, real estate and hedge funds, and direct private investments are valued at estimated fair value based on quarterly financial information received from the investment advisor and/or general partner. Investments in real estate properties are valued on a quarterly basis using the income approach. Valuation estimates are periodically supplemented by third party appraisals. The insurance buy-in contracts represent policies held by the Honeywell UK Pension Scheme, whereby the cost of providing pension benefits to plan participants is funded by the policies. The cash flows from the policies are intended to match the pension benefits. The fair value of these policies is based on an estimate of the policies' exit price. The Company's funding policy for qualified defined benefit pension plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to satisfy regulatory funding standards. In 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company was not required to make contributions to the U.S. pension plans and no contributions were made. The Company is not required to make any contributions to the U.S. pension plans in 2023. In 2022, contributions of $ 10 million were made to the non-U.S. pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding requirements. In 2023, the Company expects to make contributions of cash and/or marketable securities of approximately $ 10 million to the non-U.S. pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards. Contributions for both the U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans do not reflect benefits paid directly from Company assets. Benefit payments, including amounts to be paid from Company assets, and reflecting expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows: U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans 2023 $ 1,139 $ 247 2024 1,121 249 2025 1,104 256 2026 1,087 264 2027 1,067 269 2028-2032 4,943 1,271 106 Honeywell International Inc.

TABLE OF CONTENTS REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the shareowners and the Board of Directors of Honeywell International Inc. Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Honeywell International Inc. and subsidiaries (the ""Company"" or “Honeywell”) as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareowners’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the ""financial statements""). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“generally accepted accounting principles”). Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 111 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Revenue Recognition and Contracts with Customers – Long-Term Contracts – Refer to Note 1 and Note 3 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company has several businesses which enter into long-term contracts whereby revenue is recognized over the contract term (“over time”) as the work progresses and control of the goods and services are continuously transferred to the customer. Revenue for these contracts is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion, generally measured by using a cost-to-cost input method. Accounting for long-term contracts requires management’s judgment in estimating total contract costs. Contract costs, which can be incurred over several years, are largely determined based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms and consider factors such as historical performance trends, inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization and anticipated labor agreements. Given the significance of the judgments necessary to estimate costs associated with these long-term contracts (which varies upon the length of the contract), auditing long-term contracts requires a high degree of auditor judgment. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to long-term contracts included the following, among others: • We tested the effectiveness of internal controls over the recognition of revenue and the determination of estimated contract costs including controls over the review of management’s assumptions and key inputs used to recognize revenue and costs on long-term contracts using the cost-to-cost input method. • We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management’s methods and assumptions used to recognize revenue and costs on long-term contracts using the cost-to-cost input method to recognize revenue over time. • We tested recorded revenue using a combination of analytical procedures and detailed contract testing. • We profiled the population of long-term contracts with longer duration and evaluated a selection of loss contracts or contracts with significant gross margin changes against historical performance to assess management’s ability to achieve estimates and to identify potential bias in the recognition of revenue over time. /S/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP Charlotte, North Carolina February 10, 2023 We have served as the Company's auditor since 2014. 112 Honeywell International Inc. TABLE OF CONTENTS CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE Not applicable. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Honeywell management maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the specified time periods and accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There have been no changes that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Honeywell’s internal control over financial reporting that have occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2022. Our management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2022. Based on these evaluations, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2022. MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Honeywell management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Honeywell’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Management assessed the effectiveness of Honeywell’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on this assessment, management determined that Honeywell maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. The effectiveness of Honeywell’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in the section titled Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

TABLE OF CONTENTS SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS Information relating to security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management and related stockholder matters will be contained in the Proxy Statement, and such information is incorporated herein by reference. EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS As of December 31, 2022, information about our equity compensation plans is as follows: Plan category Number of Securities to be Issued Upon Exercise of Outstanding Options, Warrants, and Rights Weighted Average Exercise Price of Outstanding Options, Warrants, and Rights Number of Securities Remaining Available for Future Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans (Excluding Securities Reflected in Column (a)) (a) (b) (c) Equity compensation plans approved by security holders 16,777,241 (1) $ 147.11 (2) 33,124,364 (3) Equity compensation plans not approved by security holders 205,709 (4) N/A (5) N/A (6) Total 16,982,950 $ 147.11 33,124,364 (1) Equity compensation plans approved by shareowners which are included in column (a) of the table are the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan and the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (including 13,855,359 shares of Common Stock to be issued for options; 2,231,425 RSUs subject to continued employment; 175,723 RSUs at target level and subject to company performance metrics and continued employment; and 330,836 deferred RSUs); and the 2016 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors and the 2006 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors (including 177,789 shares of Common Stock to be issued for options; and 6,109 RSUs subject to continued services). RSUs included in column (a) of the table represent the full number of RSUs awarded and outstanding whereas the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon vesting will be lower than what is reflected on the table because the value of shares required to meet employee tax withholding requirements are not issued. Because the number of future shares that may be distributed to employees participating in the Honeywell Global Stock Plan is unknown, no shares attributable to that plan are included in column (a) of the table above. (2) Column (b) relates to stock options and does not include any exercise price for RSUs because an RSU’s value is dependent upon attainment of certain performance goals and/or continued employment or service and they are settled for shares of Common Stock on a one-for-one basis. (3) The number of shares that may be issued under the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan as of December 31, 2022, is 30,635,612, which includes the following additional shares that may again be available for issuance: shares that are settled for cash, expire, are canceled, or under similar prior plans, are tendered as option exercise price or tax withholding obligations, are reacquired with cash option exercise price or with monies attributable to any tax deduction to Honeywell upon the exercise of an option, or are under any outstanding awards assumed under any equity compensation plan of an entity acquired by Honeywell. No securities are available for future issuance under the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan. The number of shares that may be issued under the Honeywell Global Stock Plan as of December 31, 2022, is 1,691,500. This plan is an umbrella plan for three plans described below maintained solely for eligible employees of participating non-U.S. countries. • The UK Sharebuilder Plan allows an eligible UK employee to invest taxable earnings in Common Stock. The Company matches those shares and dividends paid are used to purchase additional shares of Common Stock. For the year ended December 31, 2022, 21,769 shares were credited to participants’ accounts under the UK Sharebuilder Plan. • The Honeywell Aerospace Ireland Share Participation Plan and the Honeywell Measurex (Ireland) Limited Group Employee Profit Sharing Plan allow eligible Irish employees to contribute a percentage of base pay and/or bonus that is invested in Common Stock. For the year ended December 31, 2022, 724 shares of Common Stock were credited to participants’ accounts under these plans. The remaining 797,252 shares included in column (c) are shares remaining under the 2016 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors. (4) Equity compensation plans not approved by shareowners included in the table refer to the Honeywell Excess Benefit Plan and Supplemental Savings Plan. The Honeywell Excess Benefit Plan and Supplemental Savings Plan for certain highly compensated employees is an unfunded, non-tax qualified plan that provides benefits equal to the employee deferrals and Company matching allocations that would have been provided under Honeywell’s U.S. tax-qualified savings plan if the Internal Revenue Code limitations on compensation and contributions did not apply. The Company matching contribution is credited to participants’ accounts in the form of notional shares of Common Stock. The notional shares are distributed in the form of actual shares of Common Stock. The number of shares to be issued under this plan based on the value of the notional shares as of December 31, 2022, is 205,709. (5) Column (b) does not include any exercise price for notional shares allocated to employees under Honeywell’s equity compensation plans not approved by shareowners because all of these shares are only settled for shares of Common Stock on a one-for-one basis. (6) The amount of securities available for future issuance under the Honeywell Excess Benefit Plan and Supplemental Savings Plan is not determinable because the number of securities that may be issued under this plan depends upon the amount deferred to the plan by participants in future years. 115 Honeywell International Inc.

In executing on these initiatives, we completed four acquisitions, drove growth in sustainable technologies and positively impacted our communities that face continued challenges from the COVID-19 pandemic and other socioeconomic factors. While executing our strategy, we maintained our commitment to create long-term shareowner value by realizing the benefits of operating efficiencies and deploying $8.2 billion to capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, and mergers and acquisitions, which was approximately $2.2 billion in excess of our operating cash flow for the year. As we look forward, we intend to continue deploying capital to high-return opportunities, including software and services with recurring revenue streams, and sustainable technologies, positioning our business for future growth. Overall, our orders were up 11%, compared to 2020, and we carry a robust backlog of $27.7 billion as of December 31, 2021. We continue to monitor and respond to several ongoing macroeconomic factors, including supply chain constraints accompanied by shortages and rising costs for materials and labor. We implemented and continue to identify actions to mitigate the effect of these factors and reduce the impact on our businesses. YEAR IN REVIEW Sales up by 5% to Diluted EPS up by Operating cash flows of $34.4 BILLION 17.7% $6 BILLION led by strong demand in certain of our businesses as result of the recovery from the global recession created by the COVID-19 pandemic reflecting strong earnings in our core businesses and continued deployment of capital for share repurchases as we remain focused on increasing operating cash flows through revenue growth, margin expansion, and improved working capital turnover Honeywell International Inc. 3 ABOUT HONEYWELL BUSINESS OBJECTIVES Our businesses are focused on the following objectives: Driving profitable growth by delivering innovative products through research and development and technological excellence, and through continued enhancement of our footprint in high growth regions; Continuing to execute on our strategy to be a premier software-industrial company, including the ongoing expansion of Honeywell Forge connected solutions for aircraft, buildings, cybersecurity, plants, and workers and driving a recurring revenue model across the Company.

While our competitive position varies among our products and services, we are a significant competitor in each of our major product and service classes. BACKLOG Our backlog represents the estimated remaining value of work to be performed under firm contracts. Backlog is equal to our remaining performance obligations under the contracts that meet the guidance on revenue from contracts with customers as discussed in Note 3 Revenue Recognition and Contracts with Customers of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Backlog was $27,682 million and $25,769 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The backlog previously disclosed as of December 31, 2020, is revised to reflect a prior period correction, which had no impact on our results of operations. We expect to recognize approximately 59% of our remaining performance obligations as revenue in 2022, and the remaining balance thereafter. U.S. GOVERNMENT SALES The Company, principally through our Aerospace segment, sells to the U.S. government acting through its various departments and agencies and through prime contractors, including the U.S. Department of Defense (as both a prime contractor and subcontractor). We do not expect our overall operating results to be significantly affected by any proposed changes in 2022 federal defense spending due to the varied mix of the government programs which impact us (OEM production, engineering development programs, aftermarket spares and repairs, and overhaul programs), as well as our diversified customer base. U.S. Government Sales ($ in millions) Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Sales to the U.S. Department of Defense $ 3,219 $ 3,661 $ 3,491 Sales to other U.S. government departments and agencies 703 557 566 Total Sales to the U.S. Government $ 3,922 $ 4,218 $ 4,057 Honeywell International Inc. 7 ABOUT HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS We engage in manufacturing, sales, service and research and development globally. U.S. exports and non-U.S. manufactured products are significant to our operations. U.S. exports represented 12% of our total sales in in 2021 and 2020, and 15% in 2019. Non-U.S. manufactured products and services, mainly in Europe and Asia, were 40% of our total sales in 2021, 2020, and 2019. Manufactured Products and Systems and Performance of Services Year Ended December 31, 2021 Aerospace Honeywell Building Technologies Performance Materials and Technologies Safety and Productivity Solutions (% of Segment Sales) U.S. exports 23 % 2 % 13 % 1 % Non-U.S. manufactured products/services 15 % 66 % 57 % 35 % Information related to risks related to our foreign operations is included in the section titled Risk Factors under the caption “Macroeconomic and Industry Risks.” RAW MATERIALS The vast majority of principal raw materials used in our operations are readily available; however, during 2021, we experienced supply chain constraints for certain raw materials. While the current supply chain constraints have not significantly impacted our business, to reduce the impact of current and future disruptions we have implemented short-term and long-term strategies to reduce the impact of current and future disruptions, and digital solutions to manage shortages and prioritize mitigation actions. We continue to leverage existing supplier relationships, and are not dependent on any one supplier for a material amount of our raw materials. Prices of certain key raw materials, including copper, fluorspar, tungsten salts, ethylene, aluminum, and molybdenum in Performance Materials and Technologies and nickel, steel, titanium, and other metals in Aerospace, are expected to fluctuate. We offset raw material cost increases with formula-driven or long-term supply agreements, price increases and hedging activities where feasible. We anticipate that supply chain constraints for certain raw materials will continue into 2022; however, we believe our short-term and long-term strategies position us well to mitigate and reduce the impact these factors may have on our businesses. As such, we do not presently anticipate that a shortage of raw materials will cause any material adverse impacts during 2022. PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES AND DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS Our segments are not dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents, trademarks, or any licenses or distribution rights. In our judgment, our intellectual property rights are adequate for the conduct of our business. We believe that, in the aggregate, the rights under our patents, trademarks, licenses and distribution rights are generally important to our operations, but we do not consider any individual patent, trademark or any licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process or product to be of material importance in relation to our total business. REGULATIONS The Company’s operations are subject to various federal, state, local, and foreign government regulations, including requirements regarding the protection of human health and the environment. Our policies, practices and procedures are designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage, and of resulting financial liability, in connection with our business. Some risk of environmental damage is, however, inherent in some of our operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses. We engage in the handling, manufacturing, use, and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous by one or more regulatory agencies. Our policies, practices and procedures are designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury, and to ensure that our handling, manufacture, use, and disposal of these substances meet or exceed environmental and safety laws and regulations. It is possible that future knowledge or other developments, such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies, could bring into question our current or past handling, manufacture, use or disposal of these substances. 8 Honeywell International Inc. ABOUT HONEYWELL Among other environmental requirements, we are subject to the Federal Superfund and similar state and foreign laws and regulations, under which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated with current and former operating sites and various hazardous waste sites, some of which are on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s National Priority List. While there is a possibility that a responsible party might be unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible parties, we do not anticipate having to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multi-party situations taken as a whole. We do not believe that Federal, State, and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, or any existing or pending climate change legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on the Company’s business and we will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area. Beyond our compliance requirements with environmental regulations, compliance with other government regulations has not had, and based on laws and regulations currently in effect, is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. See section titled Risk Factors for additional information on government regulation that could impact our business. Honeywell International Inc. 9 ABOUT HONEYWELL SUSTAINABLE COMMITMENTS AND SOLUTIONS In April 2021, we committed to become carbon neutral in our operations and facilities by 2035. We plan to accomplish this through a combination of innovative investments in energy savings projects, conversion to renewable energy sources, completion of capital improvement projects at our sites, upgrading our fleet of vehicles, and, if necessary, using credible carbon credits. Our greenhouse gas reduction program initially began in 2004, in our view setting us well on our way to achieving this commitment. We see ourselves as a responsible corporate citizen, leading sustainable change within the global marketplace. While we focus on our own sustainability commitments, we seek to partner as an agent of change with our customers around the world through sustainable products, services, and solutions. 1 Available through the Honeywell Partnership Ecosystem.

ABOUT HONEYWELL HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT We believe a commitment to and investment in human capital management enables better decision making, helps us build competitive advantage, and furthers our long-term success. As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 99,000 (1) employees across 82 countries, 34,000 (1) of whom are in the United States. Human capital management is the key driver of our performance culture, which enables our workforce to respond to the fast-changing needs of our customers. Our performance culture is defined by a set of eight Honeywell Behaviors, which reflect the bold, entrepreneurial spirit we seek to foster while emphasizing our goal to operate with speed and precision. At their foundation is a commitment to Integrity and Ethics, Inclusion and Diversity, and Workplace Respect, fundamental values that underlie everything we do. As of December 31, 2021 , we employed approximately 99,000 EMPLOYEES (1) Across 82 COUNTRIES 34,000 (1) of whom are in the United States.

HONEYWELL BEHAVIORS HAVE A PASSION FOR WINNING BE COURAGEOUS BE A ZEALOT FOR GROWTH BECOME YOUR BEST THINK BIG... THEN MAKE IT HAPPEN BE COMMITTED ACT WITH URGENCY BUILD EXCEPTIONAL TALENT In 2021, we furthered our foundational principles of Inclusion and Diversity by appointing a Chief Inclusion and Diversity Officer and Inclusion and Diversity leaders for each business unit focusing on three key priorities: Representation Retention Recognition Cultivate a workforce that reflects our communities and the world Create employee development and advancement opportunities Be a global employer of choice for Inclusion and Diversity Sustain a pipeline of diverse talent from campus to the C-Suite Foster community engagement and belonging Leverage our culture as a competitive advantage Promote a culture of inclusion, accessibility, and respect Offer competitive compensation, rewards, and recognition Lead on Inclusion and Diversity practices Our commitment to these fundamental values and the Honeywell Behaviors starts at the top with a diverse Board of Directors and executive management team, who represent a broad spectrum of backgrounds and perspectives. We believe that the diversity of our current Board of Directors (four women, and two Hispanic, two African American, and one Asian American director) and the diversity of Honeywell’s executive leadership (more than half of the Company’s nine executive officers are diverse by ethnic background, non-U.S. place of birth or gender) supports our evolving business strategy and is a testament to Honeywell’s ongoing commitment to hiring, developing, and retaining diverse talent. The Company’s commitment to Inclusion and Diversity enables better decision-making, helps build competitive advantages, and furthers long-term success. Honeywell International Inc. 11 ABOUT HONEYWELL In 2020, we established a Global Inclusion and Diversity Steering Committee co-sponsored by our Chairman and CEO, Senior Vice President and General Counsel, and Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer and fortified our inclusion and diversity governance structure by embedding Inclusion and Diversity Councils in each of our business groups. The governance structure provides a scalable model that supports our seven affinity group employee networks and facilitates the introduction of new networks to reflect the diverse characteristics of our workforce. These networks are designed to provide training and development opportunities and expand internal networks for promotional opportunities.

ABOUT HONEYWELL In addition, our people managers are expected to model behaviors that promote a culture that is open and inclusive for all employees. We help managers develop this skill as they do any other leadership skill, though training programs, interactive learning and real time events, including the hiring and talent review processes. Our Leadership Edge program provides training in core management skills to leaders across the organization. Training programs are available to all employees through our internal learning and development platform, which assigns curriculum tailored to an employee’s job responsibilities. Employees can also access additional trainings on-demand to continue to enhance their skills. We deploy unconscious bias and inclusive leadership training to our global workforce to educate and influence behavior. Our internal talent acquisition and management platform is a key component to recruiting, hiring, and developing top-performing talent. Our hiring practices consider a diverse slate of candidates and our hiring managers are provided training and toolkits to reinforce their role in bringing diverse talent into the Company. Further, we partner with top academic institutions and external professional organizations to enhance the diversity of our workforce to attract and retain top talent. Our talent review process requires our people managers to have semi-annual career discussions with each member of their teams to discuss the best opportunity for growth and development, which enhances our identification of candidates for internal promotion and succession planning. Finally, our Code of Business Conduct establishes the baseline requirements of our integrity and compliance program and promotes an environment where everyone is treated ethically and with respect. It outlines our pledge to recognize the dignity of each individual, respect each employee, provide compensation and benefits that are competitive, promote self-development through training, and value diversity of perspectives and ideas. All employees must complete Code of Business Conduct training and, where permitted by law, must also certify each year that they will comply with the Code. Overall, we believe our culture, along with our internal tools and initiatives, enable us to effectively execute our human capital strategy. For discussion on the risks relating to our inability to attract and retain top-performing talent, please see section titled Risk Factors.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in tables and graphs in millions) The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Honeywell International Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (Honeywell or the Company) for the three years ended December 31, 2021. All references to Notes relate to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the section titled Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. On November 29, 2021, Honeywell Quantum Solutions, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Honeywell, which was previously reported within the Aerospace reportable business segment, combined with Cambridge Quantum Computing, to form Quantinuum. Following the combination, Honeywell consolidated and reported Quantinuum within Corporate and All Other. Quantinuum is considered a separate operating segment, but does not meet aggregation criteria for presentation as a separate reportable segment. For this reason, it is reported within Corporate and All Other, which is not considered a reportable business segment. For the eleven months ended November 30, 2021 and the years ended December 31, 2020 and 20219, Honeywell Quantum Solutions incurred operating losses of $50 million, $41 million, and $36 million, respectively. Prior to November 29, 2021, our Aerospace business segment included the operating results of Honeywell Quantum Solutions. Quantinuum is well-positioned to lead the quantum computing industry by offering advanced, fully integrated hardware and software solutions at an unprecedented pace, scale, and level of performance to large high-growth markets worldwide. Quantinuum supports customer needs for improved computation in cyber security, drug discovery and delivery, material science, finance, and optimization across all major industrial markets. A detailed discussion of the prior year 2020 to 2019 year-over-year changes is not included herein and can be found in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section in the 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed February 12, 2021 . COVID-19 UPDATE In 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact around the world. Many jurisdictions worldwide continue to distribute vaccines as a method to limit and control infections; however, the pandemic continues to impact our business as vaccine efforts face challenges and new variants of the virus emerge. Select governments continue to place restrictions on businesses (impacting manufacturing capabilities and distribution channels). Global supply shortages emerged for certain products (including electrical components), leading to delays in delivery schedules. Historically reliable supply chains were disrupted, impacting certain of our businesses. In certain parts of the world, labor shortages intensified. These events continue to impact our business operations. As new variants of the virus emerge, we remain cautious as many factors remain unpredictable. We actively monitor and respond to the changing conditions created by the pandemic, with focus on prioritizing the health and safety of our employees, dedicating resources to support our communities, and innovating to address our customers’ needs. In 2021, we actively promoted vaccines as a mechanism to protect the health of our employees. We supported several large-scale vaccination events to provide vaccines to our employees, their families, and the surrounding communities. In situations when local medical care was unavailable, we provided additional support to our employees to ensure they received the medical care needed. We continue to adapt our safety and hygiene protocols to enable our manufacturing employees to operate safely through the pandemic. We also continue to utilize our procedures for a phased return of our employees to our office sites, and in many parts of the world, we returned our non-manufacturing employees to the workplace. However, in certain countries, our non-manufacturing employees continue to work from home (for roles that allow for remote work). On September 9, 2021, President Biden announced several initiatives to drive higher vaccination rates in the U.S., including an executive order for U.S. Government contractors to mandate vaccination against COVID-19. In response to these initiatives, we implemented a vaccine mandate requiring all U.S.-based employees at work locations that work on or in support of contracts with the U.S. Government to receive their first vaccine dose, or a medical or religious exemption, by January 4, 2022. Similarly, the Company adopted a vaccine mandate for all prospective and future employees and announced a timeline for a vaccine mandate for our remaining U.S. employees. We continue to monitor and respond to the changing conditions created by the pandemic. Honeywell International Inc. 15 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS EMPLOYEE HEALTH, SAFETY, AND ECONOMIC WELLNESS We continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation and its impacts globally. We are prioritizing the health and safety of our employees. Out of an abundance of caution for the health of our employees and to support local government initiatives to stem the spread of the virus, we implemented several precautions at various sites around the world. These include, but are not limited to: • Limiting visitor site access to business-essential purposes; • Enabling employees to work from home wherever and whenever required or appropriate; • Continuously updating travel guidance, according to latest developments; and • Complying with all local health authority guidance or regulations and our own protocols, including requesting employees to comply with self-quarantine requirements whenever advisable. PLANT PRODUCTIVITY AND SAFETY We continue to operate our manufacturing facilities with minimal disruption in our productivity. As of December 31, 2021, all of our manufacturing sites were operating at normal production levels. We continue to provide essential services and produce essential goods around the world. We employ standards such as screening checks, use of masks, face coverings, and other safety equipment and social distancing practices along production lines in our production facilities at all times in compliance with local government requirements and CDC guidelines. We take appropriate actions including disinfecting and quarantine procedures when a suspected COVID-19 case is identified. CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS Current global economic conditions due to COVID-19 continue to impact our customers’ and suppliers’ ability to operate at normal levels. We continue to work with our suppliers to manage our supply chain disruptions and limit our exposure. We also work closely with our customers to manage expectations and meet their demand needs. See the section titled Risk Factors for a discussion of risks associated with the potential adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the impact of any applicable vaccine mandates. 16 Honeywell International Inc. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Consolidated Financial Results Net Sales by Segment Honeywell International Inc. 17 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Segment Profit by Segment 18 Honeywell International Inc. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS Net Sales The change in net sales was attributable to the following: 2021 Versus 2020 2020 Versus 2019 Volume 1 % (12) % Price 3 % 1 % Foreign Currency Translation 1 % — % Acquisitions/Divestitures — % — % 5 % (11) % 2021 compared with 2020 A discussion of net sales by segment can be found in the Review of Business Segments section of this Management Discussion and Analysis. Net sales increased due to the following: • Favorable pricing and price increases to offset the rising cost of materials, • The favorable impact of foreign currency translation, driven by the weakening of the U.S. Dollar against the currencies of the majority of our international markets, primarily the Euro, British Pound, Chinese Renminbi, Canadian Dollar, and Australian Dollar, and • Higher sales volumes due to an increase in demand for certain products and services as the global economy showed signs of recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Honeywell International Inc. 19 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Cost of Products and Services Sold 2021 compared with 2020 Cost of products and services sold increased in 2021 primarily due to the following: • Higher direct and indirect material costs of approximately $1,350 million, due in part to supply chain constraints, and • Higher repositioning and other costs of approximately $150 million, • Partially offset by cost actions to improve productivity of approximately $380 million. Gross Margin 2021 compared with 2020 Gross margin increased due to the following: • Favorable pricing, • Higher productivity, • The favorable impact of foreign currency translation, and • Increased demand for our products, • Partially offset by higher direct and indirect material costs, higher repositioning and other costs of approximately $150 million, and a larger portion of our sales being driven by our Safety and Productivity Solutions segment. 20 Honeywell International Inc. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 2021 compared with 2020 Selling, general and administrative expenses and Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales changed due to the following: • Higher expenses due to increased sales volumes and labor expense, • Partially offset by higher productivity, including lower costs resulting from repositioning actions. Honeywell International Inc. 21 MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Other (Income) Expense 2021 2020 2019 Other (Income) Expense $ (1,378) $ (675) $ (1,065) 2021 compared with 2020 Other (income) expense increased due to the following: • Prior year non-cash charges associated with the reduction in value of reimbursement receivables due from Garrett, • Higher pension income, and • Gain on sale of the retail footwear business, • Partially offset by the recognition of an expense related to UOP matters and increased foreign exchange expense. See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on UOP Matters. Tax Expense 2021 compared with 2020 The effective tax rate for 2021 was higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the following: • Accrued withholding taxes related to unremitted foreign earnings, • The establishment of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets not expected to be realized, and • Incremental tax reserves and state taxes, • Partially offset by the tax impact of restructuring. For further discussion of changes in the effective tax rate, see Note 5 Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 22 Honeywell International Inc. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Income Attributable to Honeywell 2021 compared with 2020 Earnings per share of common stock–assuming dilution increased due to the following: • Higher segment profit, • Prior year non-cash charges associated with the reduction in value of reimbursement receivables due from Garrett, • Higher pension income, • Gain on sale of the retail footwear business, and • Favorable impact of lower share count, • Partially offset by higher income taxes, an expense related to UOP matters, and higher foreign exchange expense. Honeywell International Inc. 23 REVIEW OF BUSINESS SEGMENTS We globally manage our business operations through four segments: Aerospace, Honeywell Building Technologies, Performance Materials and Technologies, and Safety and Productivity Solutions.

Honeywell International Inc. 27 REVIEW OF BUSINESS SEGMENTS CORPORATE AND ALL OTHER Corporate and All Other primarily includes unallocated corporate costs, interest expense on holding-company debt and the controlling majority-owned interest in Quantinuum. Corporate and All Other is not considered a separate reportable business segment as segment reporting criteria is not met for the activities reported with Corporate and All Other and the Company does not believe the results of operations are meaningful to investors. The Company continues to monitor the activities in Corporate and All Other to determine the need for further reportable business segment disaggregation. REPOSITIONING CHARGES See Note 4 Repositioning and Other Charges of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our repositioning actions and related charges incurred in 2021, 2020, and 2019. Cash spending related to our repositioning actions was $ 382 million, $564 million and $249 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, and was funded through operating cash flows. 28 Honeywell International Inc. RISK FACTORS Our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition are subject to the material risks and uncertainties set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. MACROECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY RISKS Each of our businesses is subject to unique industry and economic conditions that may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations. • Aerospace —Our Aerospace business is impacted by customer buying patterns of aftermarket parts, supplier stability, factory transitions, and global supply chain capacity constraints that may lead to shortages of crucial components. Operating results may be adversely affected by downturns in the global demand for air travel, which may impact new aircraft production or result in the delay or cancellation of new aircraft orders, delays in launch schedules for new aircraft, the retirement of aircraft and reductions in global flying hours, which impacts air transport and regional, business, and general aviation aircraft utilization rates. Operating results may also be adversely affected by any decrease in air travel demand due to regional restrictions or suspension of service for public health, safety, or environmental events, such as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which impacted our operating results. Operating results could also be impacted by changes in overall trends related to end market demand for the product portfolio, as well as new entrants and non-traditional players entering the market. Operating results in our Defense and Space business unit may be affected by the mix of U.S. and foreign government appropriations for defense and space programs and by compliance risks. Results may also be impacted by the potential introduction of counterfeit parts into our global supply chain. • Honeywell Building Technologies —Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in the level of global commercial construction activity (including retrofits and upgrades), lower capital spending and operating expenditures on building projects, changes in the competitive landscape including new market entrants and new technologies, and fluctuations in inventory levels in distribution channels. • Performance Materials and Technologies —Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, refining, petrochemical, and semiconductor plants, our customers’ availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion, raw material demand and supply, product commoditization, continued illegal imports of hydrofluorocarbons into Europe, and our ability to maximize our facilities’ production capacity and minimize downtime. Periods of increased volatility in oil and natural gas prices may result in less investment by our customers and therefore, lower demand for our products and services. • Safety and Productivity Solutions —Operating results may be adversely impacted by reduced investments in process automation, safety monitoring, and plant capacity utilization initiatives, fluctuations in retail markets, a slowdown in demand for safety products, changes in the competitive landscape, including new market entrants and technology that may lead to product commoditization, and adverse industry economic conditions, all of which could result in lower market share, reduced selling prices and lower margins. The global COVID-19 pandemic and related impacts have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flow. The continued global spread of COVID-19 creates significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption that have impacted our business, operations, and financial results and may continue to do so. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including: the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic, including emergence and impact of new variants; some of which have been, and may be in the future, more virulent or transmissible than the initial strain, and any continued increase in cases globally and across the United States in particular, including breakthrough infections among the fully vaccinated population, as well as the timing, availability, and acceptance of effective medical treatments and vaccines; the pace of vaccine deployment; the impact of vaccine mandates, governmental, business and individual decisions and actions; the impact of the pandemic on economic activity; and the extent to which we or our employees, customers, suppliers, service providers or other business partners may be prevented from conducting normal business activities, including due to shutdowns or other restrictive measures that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. These factors could, among other things, continue to disrupt (i) the purchasing, contracting and payment behaviors of our customers and their end-users; (ii) our operations, including our manufacturing activities, the shipment of our products, and the performance of our suppliers and service providers; and (iii) our liquidity and cash flow. Honeywell International Inc. 29 RISK FACTORS Risks arising from the COVID-19 pandemic impacting our business and that may continue to impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects include, among other things: • Customer Risk —Existing and potential customers and their end-users may continue to take actions to reduce or suspend operations, reduce or delay spending, cancel contracts, or cut costs in a manner that reduces demand for our products and services. In particular, lower demand for air travel may continue to cause our customers to delay or suspend spending in connection with the manufacturing, repair, overhaul or servicing of aircraft, and there may be long-term deterioration in demand for air travel that could impact our business beyond the current COVID-19 health crisis. Customers may also continue to attempt to renegotiate contracts and obtain concessions, face financial constraints on their ability to make payments to us on a timely basis or at all, or enter into bankruptcy or discontinue their business operations, and we may continue to be required to discount the pricing of our products. In addition, unfavorable customer site conditions, such as closure of or access restrictions to customer facilities, and disruptions to our customers’ third-party logistics, warehousing, inventory management, and distribution services may continue to limit our ability to sell products, meet billing milestones, or provide services. • Operations Risk —The closure of our facilities, restrictions inhibiting our employees’ ability to access those facilities, materials and labor shortages, and disruptions to the ability of our suppliers or service providers to deliver goods or services to us (including as a result of supplier facility closures or access restrictions, disruptions to their supply chains, and supplier liquidity or bankruptcy risk) could further disrupt our ability to provide our services and solutions and result in, among other things, higher costs which may not be recoverable under customer contracts, claims for liquidated damages in the event of delays, terminations of customer contracts and losses of revenue. Because the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our near-term and long-term revenues, earnings, liquidity, and cash flows, we have taken and may be required to redeploy significant cost actions, including but not limited to reducing discretionary expenses (such as non-essential travel, contractors, and consultants), reducing hiring, canceling annual merit increases, reducing executive and board of director pay, reducing work schedules across the enterprise, shortening or staggering work schedules to match production with demand, and reducing staffing levels, as well as increasing supplier-based productivity and enhancing spending-limit controls. However, the extent to which our mitigation efforts are successful, if at all, is not currently ascertainable; also, our costs may not decrease at the same pace as revenue declines as many of our costs are less variable in nature, and we may not be able to or may not choose to significantly reduce them in an effort to remain focused on long-term outlook and growth opportunities. Further, our management of the impact of COVID-19 will continue to require significant investment of time from our management and employees, as well as resources across our global enterprise. The focus on managing and mitigating the impacts of COVID-19 on our business may cause us to divert or delay the application of our resources toward new initiatives or investments, which may adversely impact our future results of operations. Issues relating to the COVID-19 pandemic may also result in legal claims or litigation against us. In addition, remote work has increased the frequency of cybersecurity attacks, including phishing, and malware attempts that utilize COVID-19-related strategies, increasing the risk of a material cybersecurity incident that could result in the loss of proprietary or personal data, render us more vulnerable to future cybersecurity attacks, disrupt our operations, or otherwise cause us reputational or financial harm. • Liquidity and Cash Flow Risk —Because of the customer and operations risks described above, our business may not continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may need to use existing cash balances to service our debt, and if such balances are insufficient, then we may be required to engage in one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring of existing debt, issuing new debt, or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Due to the changing landscape of the COVID-19 pandemic and the responses to curb its spread, we cannot predict the ultimate impact the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flow. Any recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic impact may be slowed or reversed by a variety of factors. In addition, even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of its global economic impact, including any recession that may occur in the future. Further, many of the factors disclosed under Risk Factors in this Form 10-K are, and we anticipate will continue to be further, heightened or exacerbated by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. A significant percentage of our sales and operations is in non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory, foreign exchange, and other risks of international operations. Our international operations, including U.S. exports, represent more than half of the Company’s sales. Risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations, wage and price controls, antitrust regulations, employment regulations, foreign investment laws, import, export and other trade restrictions (such as sanctions and embargoes), differing levels of protection of intellectual property, acts of industrial espionage, violations by our employees of anti-corruption laws (despite our efforts to mitigate such risk), changes in regulations regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private enterprises, acts of terrorism, acts of war, civil strife, and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions. Instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment and the evolving international and domestic political, regulatory, and economic landscape, including the potential for changes in global trade policies, including sanctions and trade barriers, and trends such as populism, economic nationalism and negative sentiment toward multinational companies, as well as the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide, can impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins. 30 Honeywell International Inc. RISK FACTORS Existing free trade laws and regulations provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products or from where we import products or raw materials, either directly or through our suppliers, could have an impact on our competitive position and financial results. The United States continues to implement certain trade actions, including imposing tariffs on certain goods imported from China and other countries, which has resulted in retaliatory tariffs by China and other countries. Additional tariffs, export controls and sanctions laws imposed by the United States on a broader range of imports, or further retaliatory trade measures taken by China or other countries in response, could increase the cost of our products. The United States and other countries may implement actions, including trade actions, tariffs, export controls, and sanctions, against other countries or localities, including potentially against certain Russian government, government-related, or other entities or individuals related to actions in Ukraine, which along with any retaliatory measures could increase costs, adversely affect our operations, or adversely affect our ability to meet contractual and financial obligations. Operating outside of the United States also exposes us to foreign exchange risk, which we monitor and seek to reduce through hedging activities. However, foreign exchange hedging activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us or be successful in eliminating such volatility. Finally, we generate significant amounts of cash outside of the United States that is invested with financial and non-financial counterparties. While we employ comprehensive controls regarding global cash management to guard against cash or investment loss and to ensure our ability to fund our operations and commitments, a material disruption to the counterparties with whom we transact business could expose Honeywell to financial loss. Operating outside the United States also exposes us to additional intellectual property risk. The laws and enforcement practices of certain jurisdictions in which we operate may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the United States and may impose joint venture, technology transfer, local service or other foreign investment requirements, and restrictions that potentially compromise control over our technology and proprietary information. Failure of foreign jurisdictions to protect our intellectual property rights, an inability to effectively enforce such rights in foreign jurisdictions, or the imposition of foreign jurisdiction investment or sourcing restrictions or requirements could result in loss of valuable proprietary information and could impact our competitive position and financial results. Risks related to our defined benefit pension plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow. Significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets, discount rates, and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and require cash pension contributions in future periods. Changes in discount rates and actual asset returns different than our anticipated asset returns can result in significant non-cash actuarial gains or losses, which we record in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and, if applicable, in any quarter in which an interim re-measurement is triggered. With regard to cash pension contributions, funding requirements for our pension plans are largely dependent upon interest rates, actual investment returns on pension assets and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations. OPERATIONAL RISKS Raw material price fluctuations, inflation, the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements, or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services, impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities. The cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products, particularly in Performance Materials and Technologies (copper, fluorspar, tungsten salts, ethylene, aluminum, and molybdenum) and in Aerospace (nickel, steel, titanium and other metals). As of December 31, 2021, Aerospace and Performance Materials and Technologies had 80% and 63%, respectively, of raw materials supply base under contract. Due to supply chain constraints and labor shortages, including as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, there have been recent inflationary trends in the cost of raw materials, including increases in labor and freight costs, for the transportation of raw materials. Our inability to offset material price or labor inflation through increased prices to customers, formula-driven or long-term fixed price contracts with suppliers, productivity actions or commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations. Many major components, product equipment items, and raw materials, particularly in Aerospace, are procured or subcontracted on a single or sole-source basis. Although we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process and we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate, it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases, in addition to other supply chain disruptions, may have in the future. Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers’ inability to scale production and adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile demand. In addition, current or future global economic uncertainty, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, may affect the financial stability of our key suppliers or their access to financing, which may in turn affect their ability to perform their obligations to us. If one or more of our suppliers experiences financial difficulties, delivery delays or other performance problems, our resulting inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts, which could, in turn, result in reduced sales and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships. Honeywell International Inc. 31 RISK FACTORS 32 Honeywell International Inc. RISK FACTORS We may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions, and divestitures may not occur as planned. We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest non-core businesses. We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by (i) the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns, including risk of impairment; (ii) the failure to integrate multiple acquired businesses into Honeywell simultaneously and on schedule and/or to achieve expected synergies; (iii) the inability to dispose of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions; and (iv) the discovery of unanticipated liabilities, labor relations difficulties, cybersecurity concerns, compliance issues, or other problems in acquired businesses for which we lack contractual protections, insurance or indemnities, or, with regard to divested businesses, claims by purchasers to whom we have provided contractual indemnification. Our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance in increasingly competitive markets with acceptable margins. Our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to (i) identify and evolve with emerging technological and broader industry trends in our target end-markets; (ii) develop and maintain competitive products; (iii) defend our market share against an ever-expanding number of competitors, including many new and non-traditional competitors; (iv) enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products; (v) develop, manufacture, and bring compelling new products to market quickly and cost-effectively; (vi) monitor disruptive technologies and business models; (vii) achieve sufficient return on investment for new products introduced based on capital expenditures and research and development spending; (viii) respond to changes in overall trends related to end-market demand; and (ix) attract, develop, and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customers’ needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products. Competitors may also develop after-market services and parts for our products which attract customers and adversely affect our return on investment for new products. The failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors or the failure to address any of the above factors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects. Failure to increase productivity through sustainable operational improvements, as well as an inability to successfully execute repositioning projects or to effectively manage our workforce, may reduce our profitability or adversely impact our businesses. Our profitability and margin growth are dependent upon our ability to drive sustainable improvements. We seek productivity and cost savings benefits through repositioning actions and projects, such as consolidation of manufacturing facilities, transitions to cost-competitive regions, and product line rationalizations. Risks associated with these actions include delays in execution, additional unexpected costs, realization of fewer than estimated productivity improvements, and adverse effects on employee morale. We may not realize the full operational or financial benefits we expect, the recognition of these benefits may be delayed, and these actions may potentially disrupt our operations. In addition, organizational changes, increased attrition, failure to create and implement a succession plan for key Company positions, not retaining key talent, inability to attract new employees with unique skills, trends in rising labor costs and labor availability, labor relations difficulties, or workforce stoppage could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position and results of operations. As a supplier to the U.S. government, we are subject to unique risks, such as the right of the U.S. government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance. U.S. government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform consistent with the terms of the applicable contract. Our contracts with the U.S. government are also subject to government audits that may recommend downward price adjustments and other changes. When appropriate and prudent, we made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in the past and may do so in the future. We are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement and security regulations. If, as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations (including investigation of violations of certain environmental, employment or export laws), Honeywell or one of its businesses were found to have violated applicable law, then it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings and/or have its export privileges suspended. Honeywell International Inc. 33 RISK FACTORS Our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities. Mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. We continue to incur remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. Various federal, state, local and foreign governments regulate the use of certain materials, the discharge of materials into the environment, and/or communications respecting certain materials in our products, and can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations, and require injunctive relief measures, including installation of costly equipment, implementation of operational changes to limit emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases, or limiting access of our products to markets, among others. In addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement of policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites, the establishment of stricter toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur additional costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations. Global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology (IT) systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company, its products, its customers and/or its third party service providers, including cloud providers. Our customers, including the U.S. government, are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products, and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats and incidents, none of them to date have been material to the Company. We seek to deploy comprehensive measures to deter, prevent, detect, respond to and mitigate these threats, including identity and access controls, data protection, vulnerability assessments, continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems. Despite these efforts, cybersecurity incidents (against us or parties with whom we contract), depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident and its effects include financial loss, reputational damage, litigation with third parties, theft of intellectual property, fines levied by the Federal Trade Commission or other government agencies, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs due to the increasing sophistication and proliferation of threats, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations. In addition, cybersecurity laws and regulations continue to evolve, and are increasingly demanding, both in the U.S. and globally, which adds compliance complexity and may increase our costs of compliance and expose us to reputational damage or litigation, monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions or fines in one or more jurisdictions. While we carry cyber insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred, that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all, or that any insurer will not deny coverage as to any future claim. The development of technology products and services presents security and safety risks. An increasing number of our products, services, and technologies are delivered with Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities and the accompanying interconnected device networks, which include sensors, data and advanced computing capabilities. We have developed product software designs that we believe are less susceptible to cyber-attacks, but despite these efforts, if our products and services that include IoT solutions do not work as intended or are compromised, the possible consequences include financial loss, reputational damage, exposure to legal claims or enforcement actions, theft of intellectual property, and diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations. 34 Honeywell International Inc. RISK FACTORS Data privacy, data protection, and information security may require significant resources and present certain risks. We collect, store, have access to and otherwise process certain confidential or sensitive data, including proprietary business information, personal data or other information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and/or customer-imposed controls. Despite our efforts to protect such data, we may be vulnerable to material security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming errors, or employee errors that could potentially lead to the compromising of such data, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions. In addition, we operate in an environment in which there are different and potentially conflicting data privacy laws in effect in the various U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and we must understand and comply with each law and standard in each of these jurisdictions while ensuring the data is secure. For example, European laws require us to have an approved legal mechanism to transfer personal data out of Europe; the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, which became enforceable in May 2018, superseded prior European Union data protection legislation and imposes more stringent requirements in how we collect and process personal data and provides for significantly greater penalties for noncompliance; and several other states and countries have passed or are considering laws that require personal data relating to their residents or citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions. Government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business, and violations of data privacy laws can result in fines, reputational damage and civil lawsuits, any of which may adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements. A material disruption of our operations, particularly at our manufacturing facilities or within our information technology infrastructure, could adversely affect our business. Our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems, and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to natural disasters or other disruptions, including hurricanes and floods, power outages, fires, explosions, terrorism, equipment failures, sabotage, cyber incidents, any potential effects of climate change and adverse weather conditions, labor disputes, critical supply failure, inaccurate downtime forecast, political disruption, public health crises, like a regional or global pandemic, and other reasons, which can result in undesirable consequences, including financial losses and damaged relationships with customers. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted and may continue to disrupt our supply chain, distribution channels, production facilities, operations and customer demand, which has negatively impacted our operations and adversely affected our business and could continue to do so. We employ information technology systems and networks to support the business and rely on them to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. Disruptions to our information technology infrastructure from system failures, shutdowns, power outages, telecommunication or utility failures, cybersecurity incidents, and other events, including disruptions at our cloud computing, server, systems and other third party IT service providers, could interfere with our operations, interrupt production and shipments, damage customer and business partner relationships, and negatively impact our reputation. Concentrations of credit, counterparty and market risk may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We maintain long-term contractual relationships with many of our customers, suppliers, and other counterparties. While we monitor the financial health of these counterparties, we are exposed to credit and market risks of such counterparties, including those concentrated in the same or similar industries and geographic regions. Changes in economic conditions, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, could also lead to concerns about the creditworthiness of counterparties in the same or similar industry or geography, impacting our ability to renew our long-term contractual arrangements or collect amounts due under these arrangements. Among other factors, changes in economic conditions could also result in the credit deterioration or insolvency of a significant counterparty. Honeywell International Inc. 35 RISK FACTORS We are impacted by increasing stakeholder interest in public company performance, disclosure, and goal-setting with respect to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters. In response to growing customer, investor, employee, governmental, and other stakeholder interest in our ESG practices, including our procedures, standards, performance metrics, and goals, we have increased reporting of our ESG programs and performance and have established and announced goals and other objectives related to ESG matters. These goal statements reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them. Our ability to achieve any goal or objective, including with respect to ESG initiatives, is subject to numerous risks, many of which are outside of our control. Examples of such risks include: (1) the availability and cost of low- or non-carbon-based energy sources and technologies, (2) evolving regulatory requirements affecting ESG standards or disclosures, (3) the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability, diversity and other standards, (4) our ability to recruit, develop, and retain diverse talent in our labor markets, and (5) the impact of our organic growth and acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or operations. In addition, standards for tracking and reporting on ESG matters have not been harmonized and continue to evolve. Our processes and controls for reporting of ESG matters may not always comply with evolving and disparate standards for identifying, measuring, and reporting ESG metrics, our interpretation of reporting standards may differ from those of others, and such standards may change over time, any of which could result in significant revisions to our performance metrics, goals or reported progress in achieving such goals. In addition, certain of our products and services, including offerings in our Defense and Space business unit, are unattractive to certain investors and may cause us to be increasingly subject to ESG-driven investment practices that preclude investment in our debt and equity. If our ESG practices or business portfolio do not meet evolving investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, then our reputation, our ability to attract or retain employees and our attractiveness as an investment, supplier, business partner, or acquiror could be negatively impacted. In addition, our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill our goals, targets, and objectives or to satisfy various reporting standards within the timelines we announce, or at all, could have similar negative impacts and expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation. LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS Our U.S. and non-U.S. tax liabilities are dependent, in part, upon the distribution of income among various jurisdictions in which we operate. Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws (e.g., potential tax law changes in the United States to increase the U.S. Corporate tax rate), regulations and judicial rulings (or changes in the interpretation thereof), potential taxation of digital services, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures, and various other governmental enforcement initiatives. Our tax expense includes estimates of tax reserves and reflects other estimates and assumptions, including assessments of future earnings of the Company, which could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets. Changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations. The sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations, including environmental, safety, performance, and product certification regulations. Within Aerospace, the operating results of Commercial Original Equipment and Commercial Aftermarket may be impacted by, among other things, mandates of the Federal Aviation Administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft. Our Defense and Space business unit may be affected by changes in government procurement regulations. Within Honeywell Building Technologies and Safety and Productivity Solutions, the demand for and cost of providing products, services and solutions can be impacted by fire, security, safety, health care, environmental, and energy efficiency standards and regulations. Performance Materials and Technologies’ results of operations can be impacted by environmental standards, regulations, and judicial determinations . Growth in all our businesses within emerging markets may be adversely impacted by the inability to acquire and retain qualified employees where local employment law mandates may be restrictive. Changes in such regulations and government policies could negatively impact us; for instance, noncompliance with legislation and regulations can result in fines and penalties, and compliance with any new regulations or policies may be burdensome and/or require significant expenditures. Increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change and other ESG matters may result in more international, regional and/or federal regulatory or other stakeholder requirements or expectations that could mandate more restrictive or expansive standards, such as stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions or more prescriptive reporting of environmental, social, and governance metrics, practices and targets, than the voluntary commitments that the Company has adopted or require such changes on a more accelerated time frame. There continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty; however, there has been an increasing amount of legislative and regulatory activity, particularly in the European Union, United Kingdom, and U.S. If environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the Company or its products, they could negatively impact the Company’s business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position. 36 Honeywell International Inc. RISK FACTORS We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters, government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties. We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations, and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employment, employee benefits plans, intellectual property, antitrust, anti-corruption, accounting, import and export, and environmental, health and safety matters. Our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities. The incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition. Vaccine mandates applicable to us, including the U.S. presidential executive order concerning mandatory COVID-19 vaccination of U.S.-based employees of companies that work on or in support of federal contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. On September 9, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order for U.S. government contractors to mandate vaccination against COVID-19. The executive order covers U.S.-based employees at work locations that directly work on or in support of contracts with the U.S. government. On December 7, 2021, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia imposed a nationwide injunction of the executive order, temporarily staying all requirements in the executive order. The District Court’s order was appealed to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, which declined to lift the injunction. It is expected that the U.S. government will appeal the stay to the United States Supreme Court. We implemented a vaccine mandate requiring all U.S.-based employees at work locations that work on or in support of contracts with the U.S. government to receive their first vaccine dose, or a medical or religious exemption, by January 4, 2022. Employees who did not satisfy these requirements, which represented less than 1% of eligible employees, were placed on unpaid leave effective January 10, 2022, and were terminated if they had not taken steps to comply by January 28, 2022. The Company has adopted a vaccine mandate for all U.S.-based prospective and future employees. In addition, on September 9, 2021, President Biden announced that he directed the OSHA to develop an ETS mandating either the full vaccination or weekly testing of employees for employers with 100 or more employees. The OSHA ETS was published in the federal register on November 5, 2021, and mandates that employees of employers with 100 or more employees either become fully vaccinated by receiving the final dose of an approved COVID-19 vaccine on or before January 4, 2022, or undergo weekly testing. On January 13, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court re-imposed a stay of the ETS and returned the case to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. The majority of the Supreme Court held that the challengers to the ETS were likely to prevail on the merits because OSHA exceeded its statutory authority. While the Supreme Court’s ruling enjoined OSHA from imposing its mandate, the ruling has no impact on the ability of private employers to impose their own vaccine mandate. On January 25, 2022, OSHA announced it was withdrawing the ETS as a result of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling. However, Honeywell has implemented a vaccine mandate for its U.S. employees who were not subject to the executive order described in the above paragraph. Additional vaccine mandates, or the requirement for employees to receive vaccine booster doses, may be announced in other jurisdictions in which our businesses operate. Our implementation of existing or additional vaccine mandates may result in attrition, including attrition of critically skilled labor, and difficulty securing future labor needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Honeywell International Inc. 37 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS Information relating to market risks is included within Liquidity and Capital Resources of our Form 10-K under the caption “Financial Instruments”. 38 Honeywell International Inc. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (Dollars in tables in millions) We continue to manage our businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of liquidity. Each of our businesses is focused on increasing operating cash flows through revenue growth, margin expansion, and improved working capital turnover. Additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short-term debt from the commercial paper market, long-term borrowings, access to the public debt and equity markets, U.S. cash balances, and the ability to access non-U.S. cash balances. CASH We monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis. Our emphasis is primarily safety of principal and secondarily maximizing yield of those funds. We diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we held $11.5 billion and $15.2 billion, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents, including our short-term investments. BORROWINGS Consolidated total borrowings were $19.6 billion and $22.4 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. December 31, 2021 2020 Commercial paper and other short-term borrowings $ 3,542 $ 3,597 Variable rate notes 622 1,122 Fixed rate notes 15,314 17,399 Other 121 266 Total borrowings $ 19,599 $ 22,384 A source of liquidity is our ability to access the commercial paper market. Commercial paper notes are sold at a discount or premium and have a maturity of not more than 365 days from date of issuance. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing acquisitions. The weighted average interest rate on commercial paper and other short-term borrowings outstanding were 0.07% and 0.27% as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. We also have the following revolving credit agreements: • A $1.5 billion 364-Day Credit Agreement (the 364-Day Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks, dated March 31, 2021, and amended on November 18, 2021. This 364-Day Credit Agreement is maintained for general corporate purposes. The 364-Day Credit Agreement replaced the 364-day credit agreement dated as of April 10, 2020, which was terminated on March 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, there were no outstanding borrowings under our 364-Day Credit Agreement. • A $4.0 billion Five Year Credit Agreement (the 5-Year Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks, dated March 31, 2021, and amended on November 18, 2021. This 5-Year Credit Agreement is maintained for general corporate purposes. Commitments under the 5-Year Credit Agreement can be increased pursuant to the terms of the 5-Year Credit Agreement to an aggregate amount not to exceed $4.5 billion. The 5-Year Credit Agreement amended and restated the previously reported $4.0 billion amended and restated five-year credit agreement dated as of April 26, 2019. As of December 31, 2021, there were no outstanding borrowings under our 5-Year Credit Agreement. We also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the SEC under which we may issue additional debt securities, common stock, and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. We anticipate that net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of existing indebtedness, share repurchases, capital expenditures and acquisitions. Honeywell International Inc. 39 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CREDIT RATINGS Our ability to access the global debt capital markets and the related cost of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. Our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debt-rating agencies. As of December 31, 2021, S&P Global Inc. (S&P), Fitch Ratings Inc. (Fitch), and Moody’s Investor Service (Moody's) have ratings on our debt set forth in the table below: S&P Fitch Moody's Outlook Stable Stable Stable Short-term A-1 F1 P1 Long-term A A A2 CASH FLOW SUMMARY Our cash flows from operating, investing, and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, are summarized as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Cash provided by (used for): Operating activities $ 6,038 $ 6,208 $ 6,897 Investing activities (1,061) (987) (533) Financing activities (8,254) (81) (6,600) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (39) 68 16 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (3,316) $ 5,208 $ (220) 2021 compared with 2020 Cash provided by operating activities decreased primarily due to an unfavorable impact to working capital, partially offset by the increase in net income attributable to Honeywell during 2021, which excludes the 2020 non-cash charges associated with the reduction in value of the reimbursement receivables due from Garrett Motion Inc. (Garrett). Cash used for investing activities increased by $74 million primarily due to a $1,065 million increase in cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and $120 million net increase in investments, partially offset by $586 million cash receipts from Garrett, $341 million increase in cash receipts from settlements of derivative contracts, and $203 million in proceeds from the sale of the retail footwear business. Cash used for financing activities increased by $8,173 million primarily due to a $7,608 million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and a $609 million increase in repayments of long-term debt, partially offset by a decrease in repurchases of common stock of $334 million. 40 Honeywell International Inc. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CASH REQUIREMENTS AND ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LIQUIDITY In addition to our normal operating cash requirements, our principal future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends, strategic acquisitions, and debt repayments. Specifically, we expect our primary cash requirements in 2022 to be as follows: • Capital expenditures—we expect to spend approximately $1.2 billion for capital expenditures in 2022 primarily for growth, production and capacity expansion, implementation of cost reduction measures, maintenance, and replacement. • Share repurchases—under our share repurchase program, $7.1 billion was available as of December 31, 2021 for additional share repurchases. We expect to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock-based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. Additionally, we will seek to reduce share count via share repurchases as and when attractive opportunities arise. The amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and our level of operating, financing and other investing activities. • Dividends—we increased our quarterly dividend rate by 5% to $0.98 per share of common stock effective with the fourth quarter 2021 dividend. We intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends in 2022. We continue to identify opportunities to improve our liquidity and working capital efficiency, which includes the extension of payment terms with our suppliers. In addition, multiple third-party financial institutions offer a voluntary supply chain financing (SCF) program which enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables from the Company to these financial institutions on terms that are negotiated between the supplier and the respective financial institution. We agree on commercial terms for the goods and services we procure from our suppliers, including prices, quantities and payment terms, regardless of whether the supplier elects to participate in the SCF program. Our suppliers’ voluntary participation in the SCF program has no bearing on our payment terms and we have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to participate in the SCF program. Amounts due to our suppliers that elected to participate in the SCF programs are included in Accounts payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2021, Accounts payable included approximately $700 million payable to suppliers who have elected to participate in the SCF program. Amounts settled with third-party financial institutions through the SCF program increased approximately $300 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2021, reflects a combination of an ext ension of payment terms with suppliers and increased utilization of our SCF program. All activity related to amounts due to suppliers that elected to participate in the SCF program is reflected in Cash flows from operating activities in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. While access to SCF could decrease if our credit ratings are downgraded, we do not believe that changes in the availability of SCF will have a significant impact on our liquidity. The impact of this program is not material to our overall liquidity. We sell trade receivables to unaffiliated financial institutions without recourse. Transfers of the receivables are accounted for as sales and, accordingly, receivables sold are excluded from Accounts receivable—net on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are reflected in Cash flows from operating activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The difference between the carrying amount of the trade receivables sold and the cash received is recorded in Cost of products and services sold on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Finally, we continue to assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit, market position, profit and cash flow contribution in order to identify target investment and acquisition opportunities in order to upgrade our combined portfolio. We identify acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses. We also identify businesses that do not fit into our long-term strategic plan based on their market position, relative profitability or growth potential. These businesses are considered for potential divestiture, restructuring, or other repositioning actions, subject to regulatory constraints. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs. Our available cash, committed credit lines and access to the public debt and equity markets provide additional sources of short-term and long-term liquidity to fund current operations, debt maturities, and future investment opportunities. See Note 9 Long-term Debt and Credit Agreements of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of items impacting our liquidity. Honeywell International Inc. 41 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS Following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and probable liability payments at December 31, 2021: Total (6)(7) Payments by Period Thereafter 2022 2023 - 2024 2025 - 2026 Long-term debt, including finance leases (1) $ 16,057 $ 1,803 $ 3,154 $ 2,761 $ 8,339 Interest payments on long-term debt, including finance leases 4,030 356 679 586 2,409 Operating lease liabilities 1,164 215 341 204 404 Purchase obligations (2) 2,585 1,067 784 562 172 Estimated environmental liability payments (3) 618 225 241 115 37 Asbestos related liability payments (4) 2,061 261 456 396 948 Asbestos insurance recoveries (5) (363) (41) (74) (54) (194) $ 26,152 $ 3,886 $ 5,581 $ 4,570 $ 12,115 (1) Assumes all long-term debt is outstanding until scheduled maturity. (2) Purchase obligations are entered into with various vendors in the normal course of business and are consistent with our expected requirements. (3) The payment amounts in the table only reflect the environmental liabilities which are probable and reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2021. (4) These amounts are estimates of asbestos related cash payments for NARCO and Bendix based on our asbestos related liabilities which are probable and reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2021. See Asbestos Matters in Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (5) These amounts represent our insurance recoveries that are deemed probable for asbestos related liabilities as of December 31, 2021. See Asbestos Matters in Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (6) The table excludes tax liability payments, including those for unrecognized tax benefits. See Note 5 Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (7) The table excludes expected proceeds from the indemnification and reimbursement agreements entered into with Resideo. See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. ASBESTOS MATTERS Payments, net of insurance recoveries, related to known asbestos matters were $240 million, $229 million and $163 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are estimated to be approximately $220 million in 2022. We expect to make payment associated with these asbestos matters from operating cash flows. The timing of these payments depends on several factors, including the timing of litigation and settlements of liability claims. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Accruals during the year for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable were $168 million, $173 million and $213 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In addition, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately $88 million, $88 million and $99 million, respectively, relating to compliance with environmental regulations. Payments related to known environmental matters were $210 million, $216 million and $256 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are estimated to be approximately $225 million in 2022. We expect to make payment associated with these environmental matters from operating cash flows. The timing of these payments depends on several factors, including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, execution timeframe of projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreement with other parties. Reimbursements from Resideo for payments related to environmental matters at certain sites, as defined in the indemnification and reimbursement agreement, were $140 million in 2021 and are expected to be $140 million in 2022. See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our environmental matters and the indemnification and reimbursement agreement entered into with Resideo. 42 Honeywell International Inc. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Derivative financial instruments are not used for trading or other speculative purposes and we do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments. The following table illustrates the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments based on a hypothetical immediate one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and the potential change in fair value for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments based on a 10% weakening of the U.S. Dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Face or Notional Amount Carrying Value (1) Fair Value (1) Estimated Increase (Decrease) in Fair Value (2) December 31, 2021 Interest Rate Sensitive Instruments Long-term debt (including current maturities) $ 16,057 $ (16,057) $ (17,022) $ (1,148) Interest rate swap agreements 3,150 60 60 (112) Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitive Instruments Foreign currency exchange contracts (3) 12,671 92 92 (628) Cross currency swap agreements 1,200 39 39 (116) December 31, 2020 Interest Rate Sensitive Instruments Long-term debt (including current maturities) $ 18,787 $ (18,787) $ (20,176) $ (1,063) Interest rate swap agreements 3,950 194 194 (148) Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitive Instruments Foreign currency exchange contracts (3) 16,123 52 52 (334) Cross currency swap agreements 1,200 (50) (50) (125) (1) Asset or (liability). (2) A hypothetical immediate one percentage point decrease in interest rates across all maturities and a potential change in fair value of foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments based on a 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities will result in a change in fair value approximately equal to the inverse of the amount disclosed in the table. (3) Changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts are offset by changes in the fair value, cash flows, or net investments of underlying hedged foreign currency transactions or foreign operations. See Note 11 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Transactions to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. Honeywell International Inc. 43 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Many estimates and assumptions involved in the application of accounting principles have a material impact on reported financial condition and operating performance and on the comparability of such reported information over different reporting periods. Critical accounting estimates or assumptions are those where the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. We consider the estimates and assumptions discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Sales Recognition on Long-Term Contracts —We recognize sales for long-term contracts with performance obligations satisfied over time using either an input or output method. We recognize revenue over time as we perform on these contracts based on the continuous transfer of control to the customer. With control transferring over time, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. We generally use the cost-to-cost input method of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as we incur costs. Under the cost-to-cost input method, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the proportion of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of our performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion requires judgment. Contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). Cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends and other economic projections. Significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. Revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances. Impacts from changes in estimates of net sales and cost of sales are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis, which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a performance obligation’s percentage of completion. Anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recognized when such losses become evident. We maintain financial controls over the customer qualification, contract pricing and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses. Income Taxes —On a recurring basis, we assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering all available positive and negative evidence, such as past operating results, projections of future taxable income, enacted tax law changes and the feasibility and impact of tax planning initiatives. Our projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume, pricing and costs, as well as the timing and amount of reversals of taxable temporary differences. We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, including resolution of any related appeals and litigation. We assess our income tax positions based upon our evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. For further discussion of additional income tax policies, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 44 Honeywell International Inc. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Impairment Testing —Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual, or more frequent if necessary, impairment testing. In testing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair value is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts, including strategic and annual operating plans, adjusted for terminal value assumptions. These impairment tests involve the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. To address this uncertainty, we perform sensitivity analyses on key estimates and assumptions. Once the fair value is determined, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, it is impaired. Any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and its fair value. Finite-Lived Intangible Assets —The determination of useful lives (for depreciation/amortization purposes) and whether or not intangible assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our finite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a finite-lived intangible asset group may not be fully recoverable. The principal factors in considering when to perform an impairment review are as follows: • Significant under-performance (i.e., declines in sales, earnings or cash flows) of a business or product line in relation to expectations; • Annual operating plans or strategic plan outlook that indicate an unfavorable trend in operating performance of a business or product line; • Significant negative industry or economic trends; or • Significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. Once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary, recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. The impairment is then measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset grouping and its fair value. We endeavor to utilize the best information available to measure fair value, which is usually either market prices (if available), level 1 or level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, or an estimate of the future discounted cash flow, level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The key estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include assumptions as to expected industry and business growth rates, sales volume, selling prices and costs, cash flows, and the discount rate selected. These estimates are subject to changes in the economic environment, including market interest rates and expected volatility. Management believes the estimates of future cash flows and fair values are reasonable; however, changes in estimates due to variance from assumptions could materially affect the valuations. Defined Benefit Pension Plans —We sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. For financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension (income) expense is calculated annually based upon various actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets could materially affect the annual pension (income) expense amount. Annual pension (income) expense is comprised of service and interest cost, assumed return on plan assets, prior service amortization (Pension ongoing (income) expense) and a potential mark-to-market adjustment (MTM Adjustment). The key assumptions used in developing our net periodic pension (income) expense for our U.S. plans included the following: 2021 2020 2019 Discount Rate: Projected benefit obligation 2.50 % 3.22 % 4.35 % Service cost 2.68 % 3.33 % 4.47 % Interest cost 1.76 % 2.76 % 3.94 % Assets: Expected rate of return 6.15 % 6.15 % 6.75 % Actual rate of return 6.84 % 13.81 % 21.20 % Actual 10 year average annual compounded rate of return 11.37 % 10.64 % 11.10 % The MTM Adjustment represents the recognition of net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans’ projected benefit obligation (the corridor). Net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the various assumptions used to value our pension plans or when assumptions change. The primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses are changes in the discount rate used to value pension obligations as of the measurement date each year and the difference between expected and actual returns on plan assets. The mark-to-market accounting method results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast MTM Adjustments. MTM Adjustments were expenses of $40 million, $44 million and $123 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Honeywell International Inc. 45 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES We determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets utilizing historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with our expectations of f uture market conditions and asset mix considerations (see Note 20 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the actual various asset classes and targeted asset allocation percentages for our pension plans). We plan to use an expected rate of return on plan assets of 6.40% for 2022, which is an increase in the assumption used for 2021. The discount rate reflects the market rate on December 31 (measurement date) for high-quality fixed-income investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations and is subject to change each year. The discount rate can be volatile from year to year as it is determined based upon prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date. We used a 2.87% discount rate to determine benefit obligations as of December 31, 2021, reflecting an increase in the market interest rate environment since the prior year-end. In addition to the potential for MTM Adjustments, changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events also affects future Pension ongoing (income) expense. The following table highlights the sensitivity of our U.S. pension obligations and ongoing (income) expense to changes in these assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant. These estimates exclude any potential MTM Adjustment: Change in Assumption Impact on 2022 Pension Ongoing Expense Impact on PBO 0.25 percentage point decrease in discount rate Decrease $29 million Increase $500 million 0.25 percentage point increase in discount rate Increase $27 million Decrease $475 million 0.25 percentage point decrease in expected rate of return on assets Increase $50 million — 0.25 percentage point increase in expected rate of return on assets Decrease $50 million — Pension ongoing income for our world-wide pension plans is expected to be approximately $1,008 million in 2022 compared with Pension ongoing income of $1,083 million in 2021. The expected decrease in pension income is primarily due to lower expected return on plan assets caused by a change in allocation of UK plan assets and higher interest costs caused by increased discount rates in our U.S. and UK plans. Also, if required, a MTM Adjustment will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022 in accordance with our pension accounting method as previously described. It is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be a MTM Adjustment in 2022, and if one is required, what the magnitude of such adjustment will be. MTM Adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond the control of the Company such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets. Asbestos Related Liabilities and Insurance Recoveries —In connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. In assessing the probability of insurance recovery, we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers. While the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. Projecting future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded. Given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections, we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries considering any changes to the projected liability, our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries. Our involvement in asbestos related personal injury actions relates to two predecessor companies. Regarding North American Refractories Company (NARCO) asbestos related claims, we estimate our NARCO asbestos liability for the resolution of asserted NARCO-related asbestos claims which qualify for payment under the NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures (Annual Contribution Claims) and for amounts owed pursuant to settlement agreements reached during the pendency of the NARCO bankruptcy proceedings that provide for the right to submit claims to the NARCO Trust subject to qualification under the terms of the settlement agreements and Trust Distribution Procedures (Pre-Established Unliquidated Claims) using average payment values for the relevant historical period. We estimate our NARCO asbestos liability for unasserted claims based on historic and anticipated claims filing experience and payment rates, disease classifications and type of claim, and average payment values by the NARCO Trust for the relevant historical period. Our estimate also includes all years of epidemiological disease projection through 2059. Regarding Bendix Friction Materials (Bendix) asbestos related claims, we accrued for the estimated value of pending claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. We also accrued for the estimated value of future claims related to Bendix over the full term of epidemiological disease projection through 2059 based on historic and anticipated claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and average resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. We update our assumptions on average payment values and average resolution values in the fourth quarter of each year. See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of management’s judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of our asbestos related liabilities and related insurance recoveries. 46 Honeywell International Inc. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Contingent Liabilities —We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and claims (some of which involve substantial dollar amounts) that arise out of the conduct of our global business operations or those of previously owned entities, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, legal and environmental, health and safety matters. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on a thorough analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters, the outcome of negotiations, the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claims, and the impact of evidentiary requirements. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to new developments (including new discovery of facts, changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases through the judicial system), changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy. See Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of management’s judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of our environmental and asbestos liabilities which represent our most significant contingencies.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Since May 11, 2021, our common stock has been listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (Nasdaq) under the ticker symbol “HON”. Prior to May 11, 2021, our common stock was listed and traded on the New York Stock Exchange. We increased our quarterly dividend rate by 5% to $0.98 per share of common stock effective with the fourth quarter 2021 dividend. We intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends in 2022. The number of record holders of our common stock at December 31, 2021 was 40,420. Information regarding securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans is included the section titled Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters under the caption “Equity Compensation Plans.” We purchased 4,256,144 shares of our common stock, par value $1 per share, in the quarter ended December 31, 2021. On February 12, 2021, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to a total of $10 billion of Honeywell common stock, which included amounts remaining under, and replaced, the previously approved share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2021, $7.1 billio n r emained available for additional share repurchases. We expect to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to generally offset the dilutive impact of employee stock-based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. Additionally, we seek to reduce share count via share repurchases as and when attractive opportunities arise. The amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and the level of our operating, financing and other investing activities. The following table summarizes our purchases of Honeywell's common stock for the three months ended December 31, 2021: Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet be Purchased Under Plans or Programs (Dollars in millions) October 1 - 31, 2021 189,536 $ 213.76 189,536 $ 7,946 November 1 - 30, 2021 — $ — — $ 7,946 December 1 - 31, 2021 4,066,608 $ 206.51 4,066,608 $ 7,106 Honeywell International Inc. 51 MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES PERFORMANCE GRAPH The following graph compares the five-year cumulative total return on our common stock to the total returns on the S&P 500 Stock Index, composite of S&P’s Industrial Conglomerates and Aerospace and Defense indices, on a 55%/45% weighted basis (the Composite Index) and Nasdaq Industrial Select Sector (XLI Index).

Honeywell International Inc. 57 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) NOTE 1 . SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES The financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The following is a description of Honeywell’s significant accounting policies. PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Honeywell International Inc. and all of its subsidiaries and entities in which a controlling interest is maintained. The Company's consolidation policy requires equity investments that the Company exercises significant influence over but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investee’s activities to be accounted for using the equity method. Investments through which the Company is not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which the Company does not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. RECLASSIFICATIONS Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS The Company considers the applicability and impact of all Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on the Company's consolidated statement of operations, balance sheet and cash flows (Consolidated Financial Statements). In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. The standard’s amendments include changes in various subtopics of accounting for income taxes including, but not limited to, accounting for “hybrid” tax regimes, tax basis step-up in goodwill obtained in a transaction that is not a business combination, intraperiod tax allocation exception to incremental approach, ownership changes in investments, interim-period accounting for enacted changes in tax law, and year-to-date loss limitation in interim-period tax accounting. Effective January 1, 2021, the Company adopted this standard. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting, which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounted principles to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by the transition away from reference rates expected to be discontinued to alternative reference rates. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope , to expand the scope of this guidance to include derivatives. The guidance was effective upon issuance and may be applied prospectively to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into on or before December 31, 2022. The Company will apply the guidance to impacted transactions during the transition period. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805) - Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers , which requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. This ASU should be applied prospectively to acquisitions occurring on or after the effective date of December 15, 2022, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impacts of this guidance on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. 58 Honeywell International Inc. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Research and development costs for projects are expensed as incurred, unless these costs relate to contracts with customers where the Company receives reimbursements. Amounts expensed as incurred for Company-sponsored research and development projects are included in Cost of products and services sold and were $ 1,333 million, $ 1,334 million and $ 1,556 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Costs related to contracts with customers for customer-sponsored research and development projects are included as a contract cost and included in Cost of products and services sold when revenue from such contracts is recognized, consistent with the Company's sales recognition policies. This revenue was $ 1,284 million, $ 1,200 million and $ 1,079 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly liquid investments having an original maturity of three months or less. INVENTORIES Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. Carrying value adjustments for inventory obsolescence is equal to the difference between the cost and net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimate selling price in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including any asset retirement obligations, less accumulated depreciation. For financial reporting, the straight-line method of depreciation is used over the estimated useful lives of 10 to 50 years for buildings and improvements an d 3 to 16 years for machinery and equipment. Recognition of the fair value of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets is required when there is a legal obligation to incur such costs. Upon initial recognition of a liability, the cost is capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the corresponding asset’s useful life. GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment testing annually as of March 31, or if a triggering event occurs or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. This testing compares carrying values to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value. The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of March 31, 2021, and determined that there was no impairment as of that date. The Company is not aware of any additional triggering events. FINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS Other intangible assets with determinable lives consist of customer lists, technology, patents and trademarks and other intangibles and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 2 to 22 years. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside the United States with a functional currency other than U.S. Dollars are translated into U.S. Dollars using year-end exchange rates. Sales, costs and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the year. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments, inventories and property, plant and equipment, including related expenses, are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect on the date the assets were acquired, while monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at year-end exchange rates. Remeasurement adjustments for these subsidiaries are included in earnings. Honeywell International Inc. 59 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS All derivative financial instruments are recorded on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. For derivatives designated as hedges of the fair value of assets or liabilities, the changes in fair values of both the derivatives and the hedged items are recorded in current earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the changes in fair value of the derivatives are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged items impact earnings. Derivative financial instruments designated as hedges must be designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception of the contract. Changes in fair value of the derivative contract must be highly correlated with changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item at inception and over the life of the hedge contract. Cash flows of such derivative financial instruments are classified consistent with the underlying hedged item. The Company elected to exclude the time value of the derivatives (i.e., the forward points) from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize the initial value of the excluded component in earnings using the amortization approach. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a net investment hedge, the gain or loss is reported as a component of Other comprehensive income (loss) and recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The gain or loss will be subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. LEASES At the inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. The assessment is based on (1) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (2) whether the Company obtains the right to substantially all the economic benefit from the use of the asset throughout the period, and (3) whether the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. All significant lease arrangements are generally recognized at lease commencement. Operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement. An ROU asset and corresponding lease liability are not recorded for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less (short-term leases), and we recognize lease expense for these leases as incurred over the lease term. ROU assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset during the reasonably certain lease term, and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. The Company's lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Lease payments may be fixed or variable, however, only fixed payments or in-substance fixed payments are included in determining the lease liability. Variable lease payments are recognized in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for those payments are incurred. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments related to initial direct cost and prepayments and excludes lease incentives. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. The Company primarily uses its incremental borrowing rate, which is based on the information available at the lease commencement date, in determining the present value of the lease payments. In determining the borrowing rate, the Company considers the lease term, secured incremental borrowing rate, and for leases denominated in a currency different than U.S. dollar, the collateralized borrowing rate in the foreign currency using the U.S. dollar and foreign currency swap spread, when available. PENSION BENEFITS The Company presents net periodic pensions costs by disaggregating the service cost component of such costs and reports those costs in the same line item or items in the Consolidated Statement of Operations as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. The other non-service components of such costs are required to be presented separately from the service cost component. The Company records the service cost component of Pension ongoing (income) expense in Costs of products and services sold and Selling, general and administrative expenses. The remaining components of costs within Pension ongoing (income) expense, primarily interest costs and assumed return on plan assets, are recorded in Other (income) expense. The Company recognizes net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plan's projected benefit obligation (the corridor) annually in the fourth quarter each year (MTM Adjustment). The MTM Adjustment is also reported in Other (income) expense. See Note 22 Segment Financial Data for a definition of Pension ongoing (income) expense. 60 Honeywell International Inc. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) SALES RECOGNITION Product and service sales are recognized when or as the Company transfers control of the promised products or services to its customers. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. Service sales, principally representing repair, maintenance and engineering activities, are recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered. Sales under long-term contracts with performance obligations satisfied over time are recognized using either an input or output method. The Company recognizes revenue over time as the Company performs on these contracts because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer. With control transferring over time, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. The Company generally uses the cost-to-cost input method of progress for contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as the Company incurs costs. Under the cost-to-cost input method, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the proportion of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. The Company reviews its cost estimates on significant contracts on a periodic basis, or when circumstances change and warrant a modification to a previous estimate. Cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends and other economic projections. Significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. Provisions for anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recorded in full when such losses become evident, to the extent required. The customer funding for costs incurred for nonrecurring engineering and development activities of the Company's products under agreements with commercial customers is deferred and subsequently recognized as revenue as products are delivered to the customers. Additionally, expenses incurred, up to the customer agreed funded amount, are deferred as an asset and recognized as cost of sales when products are delivered to the customer. The deferred customer funding and costs result in recognition of deferred costs (asset) and deferred revenue (liability) on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheet. Capitalized contract fulfillment costs were approximately $ 1.3 billion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. The amounts recognized as Cost of products and services sold were approximately $ 0.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Revenues for the Company's mechanical service programs are recognized as performance obligations that are satisfied over time, with recognition reflecting a series of distinct services using the output method. The terms of a contract or the historical business practice can give rise to variable consideration due to, but not limited to, cash-based incentives, rebates, performance awards, or credits. The Company estimates variable consideration at the most likely amount the Company will receive from customers. The Company includes estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized for such transaction will not occur, or when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. The Company's estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of the Company's anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to the Company. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS The principal awards issued under the Company's stock-based compensation plans, which are described in Note 15 Stock-Based Compensation Plans, are non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units. The cost for such awards is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods (generally the vesting period of the equity award) and is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant to recognize expense for those awards that are expected to vest and are based on the Company's historical forfeiture rates. Honeywell International Inc. 61 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) INCOME TAXES Significant judgment is required in evaluating tax positions. The Company establishes reserves for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum recognition threshold. The approach for evaluating certain and uncertain tax positions is defined by the authoritative guidance which determines when a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are examined by various federal, state and foreign tax authorities. The Company regularly assesses the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of the Company's provision for income taxes. The Company continually assesses the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a change in estimate become known. For additional information, see Note 5 Income Taxes. EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and all dilutive potential common shares outstanding. ENVIRONMENTAL The Company accrues costs related to environmental matters when it is probable that it has incurred a liability related to a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated. For additional information, see Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies. ASBESTOS RELATED LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE RECOVERIES The Company recognizes a liability for any asbestos related contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. In connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, the Company records asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. For additional information, see Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies. REIMBURSEMENT RECEIVABLES In conjunction with the Resideo Technologies, Inc. (Resideo) spin-off, the Company entered into a reimbursement agreement under which Honeywell receives cash payments as reimbursement primarily related to net spending for environmental matters at certain sites as defined in the reimbursement agreement. Accordingly, the Company recorded receivables based on estimates of the underlying reimbursable Honeywell environmental spend, and the Company monitors the recoverability of such receivables, which are subject to the terms of applicable credit agreements and general ability to pay. 62 Honeywell International Inc. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) NOTE 2. ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES ACQUISITIONS On November 29, 2021, Honeywell Quantum Solutions, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Honeywell, and Cambridge Quantum Computing, a leading developer of quantum computing and quantum software, combined to form Quantinuum . Prior to closing the transaction, Honeywell held a 4.2 % ownership interest in Cambridge Quantum Computing. At closing of the business combination, Honeywell contributed an additional $ 270 million of cash and is the controlling majority-owner of Quantinuum, with an overall 54 % ownership in the business. Quantinuum is well positioned to lead the quantum computing industry by offering advanced, fully integrated hardware and software solutions at an unprecedented pace, scale and level of performance to large high-growth markets worldwide. Quantinuum supports customer needs for improved computation in cyber security, drug discovery and delivery, material science, finance, and optimization across all major industrial markets. The business is included within Corporate and All Other, which is not considered a reportable business segment. The combination was accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting; as such, assets and liabilities of Quantinuum are consolidated by Honeywell and included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Upon close of the transaction, Honeywell recorded a non-cash adjustment of $ 460 million in Additional paid-in-capital on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as the contribution of ownership interest in Honeywell Quantum Solutions and Cambridge Quantum Computing for the formation of Quantinuum. In addition, Honeywell recognized a gain of $ 22 million related to the fair value remeasurement of Honeywell's existing 4.2 % ownership interest in Cambridge Quantum Computing, which was recorded in Other (income) expense on in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. At close of the transaction, the fair value of Cambridge Quantum Computing's noncontrolling interest in Quantinuum was $ 419 million. In December 2021, Cambridge Quantum Computing contributed cash of $ 12 million to Quantinuum, increasing their noncontrolling interest and decreasing Honeywell's additional-paid-in-capital. As of December 31, 2021, the assets and liabilities in Honeywell's Consolidated Balance Sheet includes $ 90 million of intangible assets and $ 943 million allocated to goodwill, which is non-deductible for tax purposes. The purchase accounting is subject to final adjustments, primarily for the valuation of intangible assets and goodwill. On February 12, 2021, the Company acquired 100 % of the shares outstanding of Sparta Systems , a leading provider of enterprise quality management software for the life sciences industry, for $ 1,303 million. Sparta Systems is expected to further strengthen the Company's leadership in industrial automation, digital transformation solutions, and enterprise performance management software. The business is included within the Performance Materials and Technologies segment. The assets and liabilities acquired with Sparta Systems are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2021, including $ 383 million of intangible assets and $ 1,011 million allocated to goodwill, which is nondeductible for tax purposes. The purchase accounting is subject to final adjustment, primarily for the valuation of intangible assets, amounts allocated to goodwill, tax balances, and certain pre-acquisition contingencies. During 2020, the Company acquired businesses for an aggregate cost (net of cash and debt assumed) of $ 261 million, which included the October 2020 acquisition of Rocky Research and the December 2020 acquisition of Sine Group. Rocky Research is a technology leader specializing in thermal, energy and power management solutions and is included within the Aerospace segment. Sine Group offers a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) that handles visitor management, workplace and supply chain solutions and is included in the Honeywell Building Technologies segment. The acquisition of Rocky Research and Sine Group included approximately $ 167 million allocated to goodwill, which is non-deductible for tax purposes. During 2019, there were no significant acquisitions that closed individually or in the aggregate. DIVESTITURES On March 15, 2021, the Company completed the sale of its retail footwear business in exchange for gross cash consideration of $ 230 million. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain of $ 95 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, which was recorded in Other (income) expense. The retail footwear business was previously included in the Safety and Productivity Solutions segment. During 2020 and 2019, there were no significant divestitures that closed individually or in the aggregate.

For a summary by disaggregated product and services sales for each segment, refer to Note 22 Segment Financial Data. The Company recognizes revenue arising from performance obligations outlined in contracts with its customers that are satisfied at a point in time and over time. The disaggregation of the Company's revenue based off timing of recognition is as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Products, transferred point in time 58 % 61 % 61 % Products, transferred over time 17 15 14 Net product sales 75 76 75 Services, transferred point in time 8 8 9 Services, transferred over time 17 16 16 Net service sales 25 24 25 Net sales 100 % 100 % 100 % CONTRACT BALANCES The Company records progress on satisfying performance obligations under contracts with customers and the related billings and cash collections are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in Accounts receivable—net and Other assets (unbilled receivables (contract assets) and billed receivables) and Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities (customer advances and deposits (contract liabilities)). Unbilled receivables (contract assets) arise when the timing of cash collected from customers differs from the timing of revenue recognition, such as when contract provisions require specific milestones to be met before a customer can be billed. Contract assets are recognized when the revenue associated with the contract is recognized prior to billing and derecognized when billed in accordance with the terms of the contract. Contract liabilities are recorded when customers remit contractual cash payments in advance of us satisfying performance obligations under contractual arrangements, including those with performance obligations to be satisfied over a period of time. Contract liabilities are derecognized when revenue is recorded, either when a milestone is met triggering the contractual right to bill or when the performance obligation is satisfied. Honeywell International Inc. 65 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) Contract balances are classified as assets or liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. The following table summarizes the Company's contract assets and liabilities balances: 2021 2020 Contract assets—January 1 $ 1,618 $ 1,602 Contract assets—December 31 2,060 1,618 Change in contract assets—increase (decrease) $ 442 $ 16 Contract liabilities—January 1 $ ( 4,033 ) $ ( 3,501 ) Contract liabilities—December 31 ( 4,290 ) ( 4,033 ) Change in contract liabilities—(increase) decrease $ ( 257 ) $ ( 532 ) Net change $ 185 $ ( 516 ) The net change in 2021 and 2020 was primarily driven by the receipt of advance payments from customers exceeding recognition of revenue as performance obligations were satisfied prior to billing. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized revenue of $ 1,925 million and $ 1,709 million, respectively, that was previously included in the beginning balance of contract liabilities. Contract assets include $ 2,035 million and $ 1,589 million of unbilled balances under long-term contracts as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These amounts are billed in accordance with the terms of customer contracts to which they relate. When contracts are modified to account for changes in contract specifications and requirements, the Company considers whether the modification either creates new or changes the existing enforceable rights and obligations. Contract modifications for goods or services and not distinct from the existing contract, due to the significant integration with the original good or service provided, are accounted for as if they were part of that existing contract. The effect of a contract modification on the transaction price and the Company's measure of progress for the performance obligation to which it relates, is recognized as an adjustment to revenue (either as an increase in or a reduction of revenue) on a cumulative catch-up basis. When the modifications include additional performance obligations that are distinct and at relative stand-alone selling price, they are accounted for as a new contract and performance obligation, which are recognized prospectively. PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is defined as the unit of account. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. When the Company's contracts with customers require highly complex integration or manufacturing services that are not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts and, therefore, not distinct, then the entire contract is accounted for as a single performance obligation. In situations when the Company's contracts includes distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer over time, they are recognized as a series of distinct goods or services. For any contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated relative standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. For product sales, each product sold to a customer typically represents a distinct performance obligation. In such cases, the observable standalone sales are used to determine the stand alone selling price. Performance obligations are satisfied as of a point in time or over time. Performance obligations are supported by contracts with customers, providing a framework for the nature of the distinct goods, services or bundle of goods and services. The timing of satisfying the performance obligation is typically indicated by the terms of the contract. The following table outlines the Company's remaining performance obligations disaggregated by segment: December 31, 2021 Aerospace $ 9,423 Honeywell Building Technologies 6,871 Performance Materials and Technologies 7,243 Safety and Productivity Solutions 4,143 Corporate and All Other (1) 2 $ 27,682 (1) The remaining performance obligations within Corporate and All Other relate to the Quantinuum business. 66 Honeywell International Inc. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) Performance obligations recognized as of December 31, 2021 will be satisfied over the course of future periods. The Company's disclosure of the timing for satisfying the performance obligation is based on the requirements of contracts with customers. However, from time to time, these contracts may be subject to modifications, impacting the timing of satisfying the performance obligations. Performance obligations expected to be satisfied within one year and greater than one year are 59 % and 41 %, respectively. The timing of satisfaction of the Company's performance obligations does not significantly vary from the typical timing of payment. Typical payment terms of the Company's fixed-price over time contracts include progress payments based on specified events or milestones, or based on project progress. For some contracts the Company may be entitled to receive an advance payment. The Company has applied the practical expedient for certain revenue streams to exclude the value of remaining performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected term of one year or less or (ii) contracts for which the Company recognizes revenue in proportion to the amount the Company has the right to invoice for services performed.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) In 2021, the Company recognized repositioning charges totaling $ 331 million, including severance costs of $ 80 million related to workforce reductions of 6,432 manufacturing and administrative positions mainly in the Company's Safety and Productivity Solutions and Aerospace segments. The workforce reductions were primarily related to the re-alignment of a product line in the Company's Safety and Productivity Solutions segment, site transitions, mainly in Aerospace, to more cost-effective locations, and the Company's productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives. The repositioning charge included asset impairments of $ 117 million primarily related to the write-down of certain manufacturing and other equipment. The repositioning charge included exit costs of $ 134 million primarily for current period exit costs incurred for previously approved repositioning projects, closure obligations associated with site transitions, and lease obligations for equipment. Also, $ 13 million of previously established reserves, primarily for severance, were returned to income due to adjustments to the scope of previously announced repositioning actions. In 2021, Other charges include $ 105 million of incremental long-term contract labor cost inefficiencies due to severe supply chain disruptions (attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic) relating to the warehouse automation business within the Safety and Productivity Solutions segment. Certain of these costs incurred include amounts and provisions for anticipated losses recognized during the fourth quarter when total estimated costs at completion for certain of the business’ long-term contracts exceeded total estimated revenue. These costs represent unproductive labor costs due to unexpected supply delays and the resulting downstream installation issues, demobilization and remobilization of contract workers, and resolution of contractor disputes. These costs do not include normal operational inefficiencies experienced during a challenging operating environment in 2021. In 2020, the Company recognized repositioning charges totaling $ 565 million, including severance costs of $ 475 million related to workforce reductions of 14,159 manufacturing and administrative positions across the Company's segments, with a majority of the workforce reductions in Aerospace and Performance Materials and Technologies. The workforce reductions primarily related to the Company aligning its cost structure with the slowdown in demand for many of its products and services due to the global recession, the Company's productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives, and to site consolidations and hub strategies. The repositioning charge included exit costs of $ 69 million primarily related to current period exit costs incurred for previously approved repositioning projects. Also, $ 47 million of previously established reserves, primarily for severance, were returned to income mainly as a result of higher attrition than anticipated in prior severance actions resulting in lower payments. In 2019, the Company recognized repositioning charges totaling $ 438 million, including severance costs of $ 260 million related to workforce reductions of 5,336 manufacturing and administrative positions across the Company's segments. The workforce reductions related to the Company's productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives and to site transitions, mainly in Honeywell Building Technologies, as the Company transitions manufacturing to more cost-effective locations. The repositioning charge included asset impairments of $ 95 million largely related to a write down in connection with assets held for sale. The repositioning charge included exit costs of $ 83 million primarily related to current period exit costs incurred for previously approved repositioning projects, termination fees associated with the early cancellation of supply agreements for certain raw materials in Performance Materials and Technologies and Honeywell Building Technologies and for closure obligations associated with site transitions.

INCOME TAXES INCOME BEFORE TAXES Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 U.S. $ 3,955 $ 3,318 $ 4,178 Non-U.S. 3,280 2,694 3,381 $ 7,235 $ 6,012 $ 7,559 TAX EXPENSE (BENEFIT) Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Tax expense (benefit) consists of Current: U.S. Federal $ 415 $ 475 $ 8 U.S. State 146 79 43 Non-U.S. 886 768 1,099 $ 1,447 $ 1,322 $ 1,150 Deferred: U.S. Federal $ 173 $ 234 $ 332 U.S. State 37 39 63 Non-U.S. ( 32 ) ( 448 ) ( 216 ) 178 ( 175 ) 179 $ 1,625 $ 1,147 $ 1,329 Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 The U.S. federal statutory income tax rate is reconciled to the effective income tax rate as follows: U.S. federal statutory income tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 % Taxes on non-U.S. earnings (1)(2) ( 1.4 ) ( 0.8 ) ( 0.5 ) U.S. state income taxes (1) 1.5 1.3 1.1 Reserves for tax contingencies 2.2 ( 2.6 ) 2.0 Employee share-based payments ( 0.7 ) ( 1.2 ) ( 1.2 ) Reduction of certain receivables — 2.0 — U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act — — ( 3.6 ) Restructuring ( 1.4 ) — — U.S. Valuation Allowance 2.0 0.1 — All other items—net ( 0.7 ) ( 0.7 ) ( 1.2 ) 22.5 % 19.1 % 17.6 % (1) Net of changes in valuation allowance (2) Includes U.S. taxes on non-U.S. earnings Honeywell International Inc. 71 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) The effective tax rate increased by 3.4 percentage points in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to the establishment of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets not expected to be realized, incremental tax reserves, a lower tax benefit from restructuring and the absence of prior year items including tax benefits realized as a result of the favorable resolution of a foreign tax matter related to the spin-off transactions, tax law changes in India and the resolution of certain U.S. tax matters offset by a non-cash charge related to the reduction of the aggregate carrying value of certain receivables with no corresponding tax benefit. The Company’s non-U.S. effective tax rate was 26.0 %, an increase of approximately 14.1 percentage points compared to 2020. The increase in the foreign effective tax rate was primarily attributable to incremental tax reserves, the tax impact of restructuring and the absence of prior year items including the favorable resolution of a foreign tax matter related to the previously completed spin-off transactions and tax law changes in India. The effective tax rate increased by 1.5 percentage points in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to accrued withholding taxes related to unremitted foreign earnings and non-cash charges related to the reduction of the aggregate carrying value of certain receivables with no corresponding tax benefit, offset by the favorable resolution of a foreign tax matter related to the previously completed spin-off transactions, tax impact of restructuring, tax law changes in India, and the resolution of certain U.S. tax matters. The Company’s non-U.S. effective tax rate was 11.9 %, a decrease of approximately 14.2 percentage points compared to 2019. The decrease in the foreign effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the favorable resolution of a foreign tax matter related to the previously completed spin-off transactions, tax impact of restructuring, and tax law changes in India offset by accrued withholding taxes related to unremitted foreign earnings. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS (LIABILITIES) The tax effects of temporary differences and tax carryforwards which give rise to future income tax benefits and payables are as follows: Deferred tax assets: December 31, 2021 2020 Postretirement benefits other than pensions $ 77 $ 85 Asbestos and environmental 468 508 Employee compensation and benefits 174 180 Lease liabilities 242 197 Other accruals and reserves 260 110 Net operating and capital losses 734 779 Capital loss limitation and carryover 151 — Tax credit carryforwards 164 219 Gross deferred tax assets 2,270 2,078 Valuation allowance ( 857 ) ( 766 ) Total deferred tax assets $ 1,413 $ 1,312 Deferred tax liabilities: Pension $ ( 948 ) $ ( 548 ) Property, plant and equipment ( 464 ) ( 437 ) Right-of-use asset ( 230 ) ( 184 ) Intangibles ( 883 ) ( 898 ) Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries ( 426 ) ( 398 ) Other asset basis differences ( 334 ) ( 169 ) Other ( 2 ) ( 31 ) Total deferred tax liabilities ( 3,287 ) ( 2,665 ) Net deferred tax liability $ ( 1,874 ) $ ( 1,353 ) 72 Honeywell International Inc. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) The Company's gross deferred tax assets include $ 901 million related to non-U.S. operations comprised principally of net operating losses, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards, primarily in Canada, France, Germany, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom, and deductible temporary differences. The Company maintains a valuation allowance of $ 703 million against a portion of the non-U.S. gross deferred tax assets. Additionally, a valuation allowance of $ 150 million was established against the U.S. gross deferred tax asset for capital losses generated from restructuring transactions during the year. The change in the valuation allowance resulted in an increase of $ 124 million, increase of $ 105 million, and a decrease of $ 23 million to income tax expense in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In the event the Company determines that it will not be able to realize its net deferred tax assets in the future, the Company will reduce such amounts through an increase to income tax expense in the period such determination is made. Conversely, if the Company determines that it will be able to realize net deferred tax assets in excess of the carrying amounts, the Company will decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a reduction to income tax expense in the period that such determination is made. As of December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a $ 426 million deferred tax liability on all unremitted foreign earnings based on estimated earnings and profits of approximately $ 17.1 billion as of the balance sheet date. As of December 31, 2021, the Company's net operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards were as follows: Jurisdiction Expiration Period Net Operating and Capital Loss Carryforwards Tax Credit Carryforwards U.S. Federal 2040 $ 684 $ 97 U.S. State 2040 390 21 Non-U.S. 2041 466 50 Non-U.S. Indefinite 2,185 — $ 3,725 $ 168 Many jurisdictions impose limitations on the timing and utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. In those instances, whereby there is an expected permanent limitation on the utilization of the net operating loss or tax credit carryforward, the deferred tax asset and amount of the carryforward have been reduced.

LEASES A significant portion of the Company's operating and finance lease portfolio includes corporate offices, research and development facilities, manufacturing sites, information technology equipment, and automobiles. The majority of the Company's leases have remaining lease terms of 1 year to 20 years, some of which include options to extend the leases for 5 years or more. Operating lease ROU assets are included in Other assets. The current portion of operating lease liabilities are included in Accrued liabilities, and the non-current portion of operating lease liabilities are included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Finance lease ROU assets are included in Property, plant and equipment—net. The current portion of finance lease liabilities are included in Current maturities of long-term debt, and the non-current portion of finance lease liabilities are included in Long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. A portion of the Company's real estate leases is generally subject to annual changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The changes to the CPI are treated as variable lease payments and recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments was incurred. In addition, a subset of the Company's automobile leases are considered variable. The variable lease payments for such automobiles leases are based on actual mileage incurred at the stated contractual rate and recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments was incurred.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING TRANSACTIONS DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its risks related to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Derivative financial instruments are not used for trading or other speculative purposes. To qualify as a hedge, derivative financial instruments must be evaluated for hedge effectiveness at the inception of the contract and designated as a hedge. Changes in fair value of the derivative contract must be highly correlated with changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item at inception and over the life of the hedge contract. FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT The Company operates a global business in a wide variety of foreign currencies. The Company's exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries, foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, and transactions arising from international trade. The Company's objective is to preserve the U.S. Dollar value of foreign currency denominated cash flows and earnings. The Company monitors its collective foreign currency exposure and enters into foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts (foreign currency exchange contracts) with third parties, when necessary, to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company has monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Prior to conversion into U.S. dollars, these assets and liabilities are remeasured at spot exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. The effects of changes in spot rates are recognized in earnings and included in Other (income) expense. The Company uses foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge its foreign currency exposure. These contracts are marked-to-market with the resulting gains and losses recognized in earnings offsetting the gains and losses on the non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities being hedged. The Company uses foreign currency contracts to hedge forecasted sales and purchases, which are denominated in non-functional currencies. Changes in the forecasted non-functional currency cash flows due to movements in exchange rates are substantially offset by changes in the fair value of these foreign currency exchange contracts designated as hedges. Market value gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in earnings when the hedged transaction is recognized. As of December 31, 2021, and 2020, the Company held contracts with notional amounts of $ 12,671 million and $ 16,123 million to exchange foreign currencies, principally the U.S. Dollar, Euro, Canadian Dollar, British Pound, Mexican Peso, Chinese Renminbi, and Indian Rupee. The Company also designates certain foreign currency debt and derivative contracts as hedges against portions of its net investment in foreign operations. Gains or losses of the foreign currency debt and derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges are recorded in the same manner as foreign currency translation adjustments. INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose the Company to market risk related to changes in interest rates. The Company uses a combination of financial instruments, including long-term, medium-term, and short-term financing, variable-rate commercial paper, and interest rate swaps to convert the interest rate mix of the Company's total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT The Company continues to monitor the creditworthiness of its counterparties to mitigate the risk of nonperformance. Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose the Company to counterparty credit risk. In addition, the Company grants credit terms to its customers in the normal course of business. The terms and conditions of the Company's credit sales are designed to mitigate or eliminate concentrations of credit risk with any single customer. The Company's sales are not materially dependent on a single customer or a small group of customers. 80 Honeywell International Inc.

All derivative liabilities are presented in Accrued liabilities or Other liabilities. In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of the Company's foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges. The carrying value of those debt instruments designated as net investment hedges, which includes the adjustment for the foreign currency transaction gain or loss on those instruments, was $ 4,074 million and $ 4,414 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Interest rate swap agreements are designated as hedge relationships with gains or losses on the derivative recognized in Interest and other financial charges offsetting the gains and losses on the underlying debt being hedged. Gains and losses on interest rate swap agreements recognized in earnings were $ 135 million of expense, $ 169 million of income and $ 70 million of expense for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy. • Level 1 - Inputs are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. • Level 2 - Inputs are based on observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical or similar assets and liabilities. • Level 3 - One or more inputs are unobservable and significant. Financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The following table sets forth the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis: December 31, 2021 2020 Assets: Foreign currency exchange contracts $ 374 $ 202 Available for sale investments 742 1,118 Interest rate swap agreements 60 194 Cross currency swap agreements 39 — Investments in equity securities 57 11 Liabilities: Foreign currency exchange contracts $ 282 $ 150 Cross currency swap agreements — 50 The foreign currency exchange contracts, interest rate swap agreements, and cross currency swap agreements are valued using broker quotations, or market transactions in either the listed or over-the-counter markets. As such, these derivative instruments are classified within level 2. The Company also holds investments in commercial paper, certificates of deposits, and time deposits that are designated as available for sale, as well as investments in equity securities, which are valued using published prices based on observable market data. As such, these investments are classified within level 2. The Company holds certain available for sale investments in U.S. government and corporate debt securities, as well as investments in equity securities, which are valued utilizing published prices based on quoted market pricing, which are classified within level 1. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts and notes receivables, payables, commercial paper and short-term borrowings contained in the Consolidated Balance Sheet approximates fair value. The following table sets forth the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that were not carried at fair value: December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value Assets: Short-term investment $ 34 $ 34 $ — $ — Long-term receivables 170 152 137 132 Long-term investment 366 366 — — Liabilities: Long-term debt and related current maturities $ 16,057 $ 17,022 $ 18,787 $ 20,176 The Company determined the fair value of the long-term receivables by utilizing transactions in the listed markets for identical or similar assets. As such, the fair value of these receivables is considered level 2. 84 Honeywell International Inc. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) The fair value of the short-term and long-term investments are based on the present value of the mandatory redemptions as reflected within Garrett Motion Inc.'s (Garrett) Series B Preferred Stock (Series B Preferred Stock) Certificate of Designation, as amended. Fair Value of the Series B Preferred Stock is not impacted by early redemptions until receipt of payment. The investment is designated as held to maturity and was initially recognized at fair value.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS The 2016 Stock Incentive Plan of Honeywell International Inc. and its Affiliates (2016 Plan) and 2016 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors of Honeywell International Inc. (2016 Directors Plan) were both approved by the shareowners at the Annual Meeting of Shareowners effective on April 25, 2016. At December 31, 2021, there were 32,337,638 , and 815,299 shares of Honeywell common stock available for future grants under terms of the 2016 Plan and 2016 Directors Plan, respectively. STOCK OPTIONS The exercise price, term and other conditions applicable to each option granted under the Company's stock plans are generally determined by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The exercise price of stock options is set on the grant date and may not be less than the fair market value per share of the Company's stock on that date. The fair value is recognized as an expense over the employee’s requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the award). Options generally vest over a four -year period and expire after ten years. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on our common stock and historical volatility of the Company's common stock. The Company used a Monte Carlo simulation model to derive an expected term which represents an estimate of the time options are expected to remain outstanding. Such model uses historical data to estimate option exercise activity and post-vest termination behavior. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The Company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements relating to the protection of the environment. The Company believes that, as a general matter, the Company's policies, practices, and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that the handling, manufacture, use, and disposal of hazardous substances are in accordance with environmental and safety laws and regulations. However, mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, the Company, like other companies engaged in similar businesses, have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims, and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. With respect to environmental matters involving site contamination, the Company continually conducts studies, individually or jointly with other potentially responsible parties, to determine the feasibility of various remedial techniques. It is the Company's policy to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters when remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work. The recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical, regulatory, or legal information becomes available. Given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws, regulations, enforcement policies, the impact of other potentially responsible parties, technology, and information related to individual sites, the Company does not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of the Company's recorded liabilities. The Company expects to fund expenditures for these matters from operating cash flow. The timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of factors, including the timing of remedial investigations and feasibility studies, the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, remedial techniques to be utilized, and agreements with other parties. The following table summarizes information concerning our recorded liabilities for environmental costs: Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 Beginning of year $ 660 $ 709 $ 755 Accruals for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable 168 173 213 Environmental liability payments ( 210 ) ( 216 ) ( 256 ) Other — ( 6 ) ( 3 ) End of year $ 618 $ 660 $ 709 Environmental liabilities are included in the following balance sheet accounts: December 31, 2021 2020 Accrued liabilities $ 225 $ 225 Other liabilities 393 435 $ 618 $ 660 The Company does not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of environmental liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies, litigation or settlements, and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined, although they could be material to the Company's consolidated results of operations and operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid. However, considering the Company's past experience and existing reserves, the Company does not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position. In conjunction with the Resideo spin-off, the Company entered into an indemnification and reimbursement agreement with a Resideo subsidiary, pursuant to which Resideo’s subsidiary has an ongoing obligation to make cash payments to Honeywell in amounts equal to 90% of Honeywell’s annual net spending for environmental matters at certain sites as defined in the agreement. The amount payable to Honeywell in any given year is subject to a cap of $ 140 million, and the obligation will continue until the earlier of December 31, 2043, or December 31 of the third consecutive year during which the annual payment obligation is less than $ 25 million. Honeywell International Inc. 93 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) Reimbursements associated with this agreement are collected from Resideo quarterly and were $ 140 million in both 2021 and 2020 and offset operating cash outflows incurred by the Company. As the Company incurs costs for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable related to the sites covered by the indemnification and reimbursement agreement, a corresponding receivable from Resideo for 90% of such costs is also recorded. This receivable amount recorded in 2021 and 2020 was $ 146 million and $ 146 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, Other current assets and Other assets included $ 140 million and $ 457 million, respectively, for the short-term and long-term portion of the receivable amount due from Resideo under the indemnification and reimbursement agreement. As of December 31, 2020, Other current assets and Other assets included $ 140 million and $ 451 million, respectively, for the short-term and long-term portion of the receivable amount due from Resideo under the indemnification and reimbursement agreement.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) NARCO Products – NARCO manufactured high-grade, heat-resistant, refractory products for various industries. Honeywell’s predecessor, Allied Corporation, owned NARCO from 1979 to 1986. Allied Corporation sold the NARCO business in 1986 and entered into a cross-indemnity agreement which included an obligation to indemnify the purchaser for asbestos claims, arising primarily from alleged occupational exposure to asbestos-containing refractory brick and mortar for high-temperature applications. NARCO ceased manufacturing these products in 1980 and filed for bankruptcy in January 2002, at which point in time all then current and future NARCO asbestos claims were stayed against both NARCO and Honeywell pending the reorganization of NARCO. The Company established its initial liability for NARCO asbestos claims in 2002. NARCO emerged from bankruptcy in April 2013, at which time a federally authorized 524(g) trust was established to evaluate and resolve all existing NARCO asbestos claims (the Trust). Both Honeywell and NARCO are protected by a permanent channeling injunction barring all present and future individual actions in state or federal courts and requiring all asbestos-related claims based on exposure to NARCO asbestos-containing products to be made against the Trust. The NARCO Trust Agreement (TA) and the NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures (TDP) set forth the structure and operating rules of the Trust, and established Honeywell’s evergreen funding obligations. In accordance with the TA, the Trust is eligible to receive cash dividends from Harbison-Walker International Inc. (HWI), the reorganized and renamed entity that emerged from the NARCO bankruptcy. HWI cash dividends are required to be used to pay asbestos-related claims which qualify for payment under the TDP (Annual Contribution Claims) until those funds are exhausted, at which point Honeywell’s funding obligation, subject to an annual cap of $ 145 million, is triggered. The Trust received dividend payments from HWI in 2021. The Company is also required to fund amounts owed pursuant to settlement agreements reached during the pendency of the NARCO bankruptcy proceedings that provide for the right to submit claims to the Trust subject to qualification under the terms of the settlement agreements and TDP (Pre-Established Unliquidated Claims), as well as fund the annual operating costs of the Trust. There is no annual funding cap relative to Pre-Established Unliquidated Claims. The operating rules per the TDP define criteria claimants must meet for a claim to be considered valid and paid, which include adequate medical evidence of the claimant’s asbestos-related condition and credible evidence of exposure to a specific NARCO asbestos-containing product. The TDP allows Honeywell to audit claim support documents against these criteria. Once operational in 2014, the Trust began to receive, process and pay claims. The Company identified several issues with the way the Trust was adhering to the TDP in audits subsequent to the Trust becoming operational. The Company consistently raised with the Trust concern that the Trust adopted an improper practice of paying claimants who have not demonstrated the requisite exposure. The Trust refused to alter its practices for payment of claims, and in September 2021, Honeywell filed suit against the Trust in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania (Bankruptcy Court) alleging that the Trust has breached its duties in managing the Trust, including breaches of certain provisions of the TA and TDP. Honeywell's lawsuit seeks appropriate relief preventing the Trust from continuing these practices. The Trust also filed suit against Honeywell, alleging Honeywell has breached its obligations under the Trust's governing documents. Honeywell moved to dismiss the Trust’s suit, and on December 15, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court granted Honeywell’s motion to dismiss subject to granting the Trust leave to file an amended complaint. On December 28, 2021, the Trust filed an answer with counterclaims in response to Honeywell’s complaint and in lieu of filing an amended complaint. At this time, the Company cannot predict the outcome of these matters, or the potential impact on the asbestos-related liabilities. Due to the bankruptcy filing in 2002, claimants were not permitted to file additional claims until the Trust became operative in 2014. As a consequence, there was a large backlog of claims filed with the Trust upon it becoming operative in 2014 through December 31, 2017, the date by which these claims had to be filed or else be barred by the expiration of the statute of limitations. Therefore, the claims filing rate did not start to normalize until 2018 and thereafter. As a result, between 2002 and 2018, the Company lacked a history of sufficiently reliable claims data to derive a reasonable estimate of its NARCO asbestos-related liability, and the Company continued to update its original estimate, as appropriate, using all available information. Beginning in 2020, with three years of sufficiently reliable claims data, the Company updated its estimate of the NARCO asbestos-related liability. The estimate for the resolution of asserted Annual Contribution Claims and Pre-Established Unliquidated Claims uses average payment values for the relevant historical period. The estimate for unasserted claims is based on historic and anticipated claims filing experience and payment rates, disease classifications and type of claim, and average payment values by the Trust for the relevant historical period. The Company utilizes an asbestos liability valuation specialist to support the preparation of the NARCO asbestos-related liability estimates during the fourth quarter each year. The Company's estimates, which involve significant management judgment, and consider multiple scenarios, include all years of epidemiological disease projection through 2059. The NARCO asbestos-related liability reflects an estimate for the resolution of Annual Contribution Claims and Pre-Established Unliquidated Claims filed with the Trust, as well as for unasserted Annual Contribution Claims and Pre-Established Unliquidated Claims. The NARCO asbestos-related liability excludes the annual operating expenses of the Trust which are expensed as they are incurred. Honeywell International Inc. 95 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) The Company's NARCO-related insurance receivable reflects coverage which reimburses Honeywell for portions of NARCO-related claims and defense costs. This coverage is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market. Honeywell's NARCO-related insurance receivable is an estimate of the probable amount of insurance that is recoverable for asbestos claims. The Company's judgments related to the Company's insurance carriers and insurance coverages are reasonable and consistent with Honeywell's historical dealings and Honeywell's knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers. Bendix Products – Bendix manufactured automotive brake linings that contained chrysotile asbestos in an encapsulated form. Claimants consist largely of individuals who allege exposure to asbestos from brakes from either performing or being in the vicinity of individuals who performed brake replacements. The following tables present information regarding Bendix related asbestos claims activity: Claims Activity Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020 Claims Unresolved at the beginning of year 6,242 6,480 Claims Filed 2,611 2,233 Claims Resolved ( 2,452 ) ( 2,471 ) Claims Unresolved at the end of year 6,401 6,242 Disease Distribution of Unresolved Claims Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020 Mesothelioma and Other Cancer Claims 3,760 3,422 Nonmalignant Claims 2,641 2,820 Total Claims 6,401 6,242 Honeywell has experienced average resolution values per claim excluding legal costs as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 (in whole dollars) Malignant claims $ 56,000 $ 61,500 $ 50,200 $ 55,300 $ 56,000 Nonmalignant claims $ 400 $ 550 $ 3,900 $ 4,700 $ 2,800 It is not possible to predict whether resolution values for Bendix-related asbestos claims will increase, decrease or stabilize in the future. The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect an estimated liability for resolution of asserted (claims filed as of the financial statement date) and unasserted Bendix-related asbestos claims, which exclude the Company’s ongoing legal fees to defend such asbestos claims which will continue to be expensed as they are incurred. The Company reflects the inclusion of all years of epidemiological disease projection through 2059 when estimating the liability for unasserted Bendix-related asbestos claims. Such liability for unasserted Bendix-related asbestos claims is based on historic and anticipated claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. The Company has valued Bendix asserted and unasserted claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. The Company updates the resolution values used to estimate the cost of Bendix asserted and unasserted claims during the fourth quarter each year. The Company's insurance receivable corresponding to the liability for settlement of asserted and unasserted Bendix asbestos claims reflects coverage which is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market. Based on the Company's ongoing analysis of the probable insurance recovery, insurance receivables are recorded in the financial statements simultaneous with the recording of the estimated liability for the underlying asbestos claims. This determination is based on the Company's analysis of the underlying insurance policies, historical experience with insurers, ongoing review of the solvency of insurers, judicial determinations relevant to insurance programs, and consideration of the impacts of any settlements reached with the Company's insurers. 96 Honeywell International Inc. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) On October 31, 2018, David Kanefsky (Plaintiff), a Honeywell shareholder, filed a putative class action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey (the Court) alleging violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 related to the prior accounting for Bendix asbestos claims. An Amended Complaint was filed on December 30, 2019, and on February 7, 2020, the Company filed a Motion to Dismiss. On May 18, 2020, the Court denied the Motion to Dismiss. On December 7, 2021, the parties filed a Stipulation of Settlement (Settlement Agreement) and Plaintiff filed a motion for preliminary approval of the Settlement Agreement, which includes payment by Honeywell of $ 10 million to settle the claims in dispute. Honeywell continues to believe the claims lack merit and denies wrongdoing as well as any liability for the claims made against Honeywell in the action. The Settlement Agreement remains subject to final court approval and other conditions. GARRETT LITIGATION AND BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS In conjunction with the Garrett spin-off, the Company entered into a binding indemnification and reimbursement agreement (Garrett Indemnity) and a binding tax matters agreement (Tax Matters Agreement) with Garrett and a Garrett subsidiary. On December 2, 2019, Garrett and Garrett ASASCO Inc. filed a Summons with Notice and commenced a lawsuit in the Commercial Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York (the State Court), seeking to invalidate the Garrett Indemnity. Garrett sought damages and a declaratory judgment based on various claims set forth in the Summons with Notice. On July 17, 2020, the Company received a notice from Garrett asserting that the Company had caused material breaches of the Tax Matters Agreement and that the Tax Matters Agreement was unenforceable. On September 20, 2020, Garrett and 36 of its affiliates filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the Bankruptcy Court). On September 24, 2020, Garrett moved the existing State Court litigation against Honeywell to the Bankruptcy Court. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company reviewed the aggregate carrying value of the receivable amounts due in connection with the Garrett Indemnity and Tax Matters Agreement and reduced the aggregate carrying value of the receivable by $ 509 million to reflect the present value of the amounts owed to the Company over the full term of these agreements. On April 26, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court confirmed Garrett’s amended Chapter 11 plan of reorganization (the Confirmed Plan), and on April 30, 2021 (the Effective Date), Garrett emerged from bankruptcy. On the Effective Date, and in accordance with the Confirmed Plan, (i) the Company received from Garrett an initial payment of $ 375 million and 834.8 million shares of Garrett's Series B Preferred Stock in full and final satisfaction of the Garrett Indemnity and Tax Matters Agreement, (ii) the Garrett Indemnity and Tax Matters Agreement were terminated, (iii) the Company and Garrett mutually released each other from the claims asserted in all pending legal actions related to the Garrett Indemnity and Tax Matters Agreement, and (iv) all pending litigation between the Company and Garrett in connection with those agreements was resolved. The original Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation provides for mandatory redemptions by Garrett of $ 35 million in 2022 and $ 100 million per year from 2023 to 2030 (inclusive) at the anniversary of the Effective Date, unless (i) Garrett’s consolidated EBITDA as of the end of the most recently completed fiscal year is less than $ 425 million, or (ii) Garrett does not have sufficient funds available to pay the redemption, at which point the redemption amounts past due will accrue interest. The Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation also includes rights which allow (a) the Company to put the Series B Preferred Stock to Garrett if certain EBITDA conditions are met, and (b) Garrett to call the Series B Preferred Stock in whole or in part if certain EBITDA conditions are met. On September 30, 2021, Garrett filed an Amended and Restated Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation (Amendment) with the Secretary of State of Delaware. The Amendment required Garrett to partially redeem a portion of the Series B Preferred Stock on or before March 31, 2022, such that the present value of remaining outstanding shares of the Series B Preferred Stock would be $ 400 million (First Partial Redemption), subject to applicable law, including that Garrett had funds legally available for the partial redemption. The First Partial Redemption would be applied to the latest scheduled redemption dates, beginning with the shares to be redeemed in 2030. The Amendment also provides that the Company cannot exercise its right to put the Series B Preferred Stock to Garrett until after December 31, 2022, subject to the EBITDA conditions described in the above section, unless the partial redemption does not occur on or before March 31, 2022. All other material terms and conditions in the Amendment were unchanged from the original Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation. On December 16, 2021, Garrett filed a Second Amended and Restated Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation (Second Amendment) with the Secretary of State of Delaware. The Second Amendment accelerates the First Partial Redemption from March 31, 2022, to December 30, 2021, and allows Garrett to partially redeem an additional portion of the Series B Preferred Stock on or before March 31, 2022, such that the present value of remaining outstanding shares of the Series B Preferred Stock will be $ 207 million (Second Partial Redemption). The Second Partial Redemption is subject to similar terms as the First Partial Redemption, including that Garrett has funds legally available for the partial redemption. However, the Second Partial Redemption is also contingent upon Garrett completing the First Partial Redemption and either (i) increasing their revolving credit facility, or (ii) the Garrett Board of Directors determining that Garrett otherwise has sufficient liquidity to effect the Second Partial Redemption. The Second Partial Redemption would be applied to the earliest scheduled redemptions beginning with the shares to be redeemed on April 30, 2022. Honeywell International Inc. 97 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) On December 17, 2021, Garrett announced their intention to effect the First Partial Redemption on December 28, 2021, in the amount of $ 211 million, and plan to effect the Second Partial Redemption during the first quarter of 2022 for a corresponding payment of $ 200 million. On December 28, 2021, Garrett paid $ 211 million for the amount due as the First Partial Redemption. The Company recorded the Series B Preferred Stock at fair value at the Effective Date. The Company believes the present value of the mandatory redemptions is an appropriate basis for determining the fair value of the Series B Preferred Stock. The Company's present value reflects amortized cost determined by the present value of the mandatory redemptions discounted at 7.25 %, which is the rate reflected in the Series B Preferred Stock Certificate of Designation. The discount amount will accrete into interest income over the mandatory redemption period. In addition to the Series B Preferred Stock, the Company subscribed for 4.2 million shares of Garrett's Series A Preferred Stock, which are convertible into Garrett’s Common Stock if certain conditions are met. Prior to and following Garrett’s emergence from bankruptcy, the Company also held 2.9 million shares of Garrett’s Common Stock. As of December 31, 2021, Short-term investments included $ 34 million and Investments and long-term receivables included $ 423 million for the Company's investments in Garrett's Series B Preferred Stock, Series A Preferred Stock and Common Stock. OTHER MATTERS The Company is subject to a number of other lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of the Company's business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability, prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, and environmental, health and safety matters (including the matter described below). The Company recognizes liabilities for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. The Company continually assesses the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes in such matters, as well as potential ranges of possible losses (taking into consideration any insurance recoveries), based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Such matters include: • Petrobras and Unaoil – The Company continues to cooperate with investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Brazilian authorities relating to the Company's use of third parties who previously worked for the Company's UOP business in Brazil in relation to Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. (Petrobras) in connection with a project awarded in 2010. The investigations focus on compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar Brazilian laws (the UOP Matters), and involve, among other things, document production and interviews with former and current management and employees. The DOJ and the SEC are also examining a matter involving a foreign subsidiary’s prior contract with Unaoil S.A.M. in Algeria executed in 2011. The Company continues to be engaged in discussions with the authorities with respect to a potential comprehensive resolution of these matters. As the discussions are both ongoing and at different stages with regards to each respective authority, there can be no assurance as to whether the Company will reach a resolution with such authorities or as to the potential timing, terms, or collateral consequences of any such resolution. As a result, the Company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these UOP Matters or the potential impact on the Company. Based on available information to date, the Company estimates that a potential comprehensive resolution of these UOP Matters would result in a probable loss of at least $ 160 million, and the Company has recorded a charge in this amount in the Company's Consolidated Statement of Operations, and accrued a corresponding liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Amounts payable to authorities pursuant to any potential final comprehensive resolution could differ from the amount recorded in the Company's consolidated financial statements. Based on available information to date, the Company does not expect that any such difference would be material with respect to the Company's consolidated financial position. Given the uncertainty inherent in litigation and investigations, the Company does not believe it is possible to develop estimates of reasonably possible losses (or a range of possible losses) in excess of current accruals for such matters. Considering the Company's past experience and existing accruals, the Company does not expect the outcome of such matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated financial position. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, potential liabilities are subject to change due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, which could cause us to pay damage awards or settlements (or become subject to equitable remedies) that could have a material adverse effect on the Company's consolidated results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid. 98 Honeywell International Inc.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) NOTE 20. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS The Company sponsors a number of both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Pension benefits for many of the Company's U.S. employees are provided through non-contributory, qualified and non-qualified defined benefit plans. All non-union hourly and salaried employees joining Honeywell for the first time after December 31, 2012, are not eligible to participate in Honeywell’s U.S. defined benefit pension plans. The Company also sponsors defined benefit pension plans which cover non-U.S. employees who are not U.S. citizens, in certain jurisdictions, principally the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and Canada. Other pension plans outside of the U.S. are not material to the Company either individually or in the aggregate. The Company also sponsors postretirement benefit plans that provide health care benefits and life insurance coverage mainly to U.S. eligible retirees. None of Honeywell’s U.S. employees are eligible for a retiree medical subsidy from the Company. In addition, the vast majority of Honeywell’s U.S. retirees either have no Company subsidy or have a fixed-dollar subsidy amount. This significantly limits the Company's exposure to the impact of future health care cost increases. The retiree medical and life insurance plans are not funded. Claims and expenses are paid from the Company's cash flows from operations. 100 Honeywell International Inc. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

Actuarial gains incurred in 2021 related to the Company's non-U.S. plans are primarily the result of an increase in the discount rate assumption used to estimate the benefit obligations as of December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020. Actuarial losses incurred in 2020 related to the Company's U.S. and non-U.S. plans are primarily the result of a decrease in the discount rate assumptions used to estimate the benefit obligations as of December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019.

The rate was changed to 2.36 % for the remainder of 2020 due to a Plan remeasurement as of October 1, 2020. The discount rate for the Company's U.S. pension and other postretirement benefits plans reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be settled at the measurement date of December 31. To determine discount rates for the Company's U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans, the Company uses a modeling process that involves matching the expected cash outflows of the Company's benefit plans to a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments. The Company uses the single weighted-average yield of this hypothetical portfolio as a discount rate benchmark. The Company utilizes a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension benefit (income) for the Company's significant pension plans. This approach applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the pension benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows and provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected cash flows and their corresponding spot rates. For the Company's U.S. pension plans, the single weighted average spot rates used to determine service and interest costs for 2022 are 2.97 % and 2.26 %. The discount rate used to determine the other postretirement benefit obligation is lower principally due to a shorter expected duration of other postretirement plan obligations as compared to pension plan obligations. The Company plans to use an expected rate of return on U.S. plan assets of 6.40 % for 2022, which represents an increase from the 6.15 % assumption used for 2021. The Company's asset return assumption is based on historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with current market conditions and broad asset mix considerations with a focus on long-term trends rather than short-term market conditions. The Company reviews the expected rate of return on an annual basis and revise it as appropriate. For non-U.S. benefit plans actuarial assumptions reflect economic and market factors relevant to each country. 104 Honeywell International Inc. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) PENSION BENEFITS The following amounts relate to the Company's significant pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations exceeding the fair value of plan assets: December 31, U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans 2021 2020 2021 2020 Projected benefit obligation $ 359 $ 353 $ 964 $ 2,116 Accumulated benefit obligation $ 346 $ 341 $ 932 $ 2,042 Fair value of plan assets $ — $ — $ 256 $ 1,208 The accumulated benefit obligation for the Company's U.S. defined benefit pension plans was $ 17.3 billion and $ 17.9 billion and for the Company's Non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans was $ 6.9 billion and $ 7.6 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The Company's asset investment strategy for its U.S. pension plans focuses on maintaining a diversified portfolio using various asset classes in order to achieve the Company's long-term investment objectives on a risk adjusted basis. The Company's long-term target allocations are as follows: 55 %- 70 % fixed income securities and cash, 25 %- 40 % equity securities, 5 %- 10 % real estate investments, and 10 %- 20 % other types of investments. Equity securities include publicly-traded stock of companies located inside the United States. Fixed income securities include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, mortgage-backed securities, and U.S. Treasuries. Real estate investments include direct investments in commercial properties and investments in real estate funds. Other types of investments include investments in private equity that follow several different strategies. The Company reviews its assets on a regular basis to ensure that the Company is within the targeted asset allocation ranges and, if necessary, asset balances are adjusted back within target allocations. The Company's non-U.S. pension assets are typically managed by decentralized fiduciary committees with the Honeywell Corporate Investments group providing funding and investment guidance. The Company's non-U.S. investment policies are different for each country as local regulations, funding requirements, and financial and tax considerations are part of the funding and investment allocation process in each country. In accordance with ASU 2015-07, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820)”, certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value (NAV) per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.

Sufficient cash or cash equivalents are held by the Company's pension plans to cover the notional value of the futures contracts. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company's U.S. plans had contracts with notional amounts of $ 4,415 million and $ 3,673 million. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company's non-U.S. plans had contracts with notional amounts of $ 311 million and $ 564 million, respectively. In both the Company's U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, the notional derivative exposure is related to outstanding equity and fixed income futures contracts. Common stocks, preferred stocks, real estate investment trusts, and short-term investments are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded. Corporate bonds, mortgages/asset-backed securities, and government securities are valued either by using pricing models, bids provided by brokers or dealers, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows and as such include adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks. Certain securities are held in collective trust funds which are valued using net asset values provided by the administrators of the funds. Investments in private equity, debt, real estate and hedge funds and direct private investments are valued at estimated fair value based on quarterly financial information received from the investment advisor and/or general partner. Investments in real estate properties are valued on a quarterly basis using the income approach. Valuation estimates are periodically supplemented by third party appraisals. The insurance buy-in contracts represent policies held by the Honeywell UK Pension Scheme, whereby the cost of providing pension benefits to plan participants is funded by the policies. The cash flows from the policies are intended to match the pension benefits. The fair value of these policies is based on an estimate of the policies' exit price. The Company's funding policy for qualified defined benefit pension plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to satisfy regulatory funding standards. In 2021, 2020, and 2019, the Company was not required to make contributions to the U.S. pension plans and no contributions were made. The Company is not required to make any contributions to the U.S. pension plans in 2022. In 2021, contributions of $ 94 million were made to the non-U.S. pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding requirements. In 2022, the Company expects to make contributions of cash and/or marketable securities of approximately $ 11 million to the non-U.S. pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards. Contributions for both the U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans do not reflect benefits paid directly from Company assets. 108 Honeywell International Inc.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the shareowners and the Board of Directors of Honeywell International Inc. Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Honeywell International Inc. and subsidiaries (the ""Company"" or “Honeywell”) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareowners’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the ""financial statements""). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“generally accepted accounting principles”). Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Honeywell International Inc. 113 REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Asbestos Related Liabilities - North American Refractories Company (NARCO) Asbestos Liability – Refer to Note 19 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company records an estimated liability for asbestos related personal injury claims related to a predecessor company, NARCO. Such claims arise primarily from alleged occupational exposure to asbestos-containing refractory brick and mortar. The Company’s NARCO asbestos-related liability reflects an estimated liability for the resolution of asserted and unasserted NARCO-related asbestos claims that are probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. The Company records an estimated liability for the resolution of asserted Annual Contribution Claims and Pre-Established Unliquidated Claims filed with the NARCO Trust using average payment values for the relevant historical period. The Company also records an estimated liability for unasserted Annual Contribution Claims and Pre-Established Unliquidated Claims based on historic and anticipated claims filing experience and payment rates, disease classifications and type of claim, and average payment values by the NARCO Trust for the relevant historical period. Beginning in 2020, with three years of sufficiently reliable claims data, the Company updated its estimate of the NARCO asbestos-related liability. Accounting for the NARCO asbestos-related liability is an inherently subjective exercise as it requires management to make significant assumptions and judgments. Given the subjectivity related to estimating the NARCO asbestos-related liability and the assessment of the sufficiency and reliability of the claims data, auditing the NARCO asbestos-related liability involved especially subjective judgment. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the NARCO asbestos-related liability included the following, among others: • We tested the effectiveness of internal controls over the estimate of the NARCO asbestos-related liability including management’s controls over the estimate for asserted and unasserted Annual Contribution Claims and Pre-Established Unliquidated Claims. • We evaluated the methods and assumptions used by management to estimate the NARCO asbestos-related liability by: ◦ Reading the Company’s analysis and third-party assessment to evaluate the Company’s methodology used in the analysis. ◦ Confirming the claims data with the NARCO Trust to evaluate the appropriateness of the underlying data used in the analysis. ◦ Making inquiries of the Company’s third-party specialist to identify the significant assumptions used to develop the analysis. ◦ Making inquiries of internal and external legal counsel regarding the regulatory and litigation environments related to the NARCO asbestos-related liability. • With the assistance of our internal actuarial specialists, we developed a range of independent estimates and compared those to the Company’s recorded NARCO asbestos-related liability. Revenue Recognition and Contracts with Customers – Long-Term Contracts – Refer to Note 1 and Note 3 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company has several businesses which enter into long-term contracts whereby revenue is recognized over the contract term (“over time”) as the work progresses and control of the goods and services are continuously transferred to the customer. Revenue for these contracts is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion, generally measured by using a cost-to-cost input method. Accounting for long-term contracts requires management’s judgment in estimating total contract costs. Contract costs, which can be incurred over several years, are largely determined based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms and consider factors such as historical performance trends, inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization and anticipated labor agreements. Given the significance of the judgments necessary to estimate costs associated with these long-term contracts (which varies upon the length of the contract), auditing long-term contracts requires a high degree of auditor judgment. 114 Honeywell International Inc. REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to long-term contracts included the following, among others: • We tested the effectiveness of internal controls over the recognition of revenue and the determination of estimated contract costs including controls over the review of management’s assumptions and key inputs used to recognize revenue and costs on long-term contracts using the cost-to-cost input method. • We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management’s methods and assumptions used to recognize revenue and costs on long-term contracts using the cost-to-cost input method to recognize revenue over time. • We tested recorded revenue using a combination of analytical procedures and detailed contract testing. • We profiled the population of long-term contracts with longer duration and evaluated a selection of loss contracts or contracts with significant gross margin changes against historical performance to assess management’s ability to achieve estimates and to identify potential bias in the recognition of revenue over time. /S/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP Charlotte, North Carolina February 11, 2022 We have served as the Company's auditor since 2014. Honeywell International Inc. 115 CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE Not Applicable. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Honeywell management maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the specified time periods and accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There have been no changes that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Honeywell’s internal control over financial reporting that have occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2021. Our management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2021. Based on these evaluations, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2021. MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Honeywell management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Honeywell’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Management assessed the effectiveness of Honeywell’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on this assessment, management determined that Honeywell maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. We have not experienced any material impact to our internal control over financial reporting during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of our employees worked remotely during the year in which we prepared these financial statements due to the impact of COVID-19. We are continually monitoring and assessing the need to modify or enhance our disclosure controls to ensure disclosure controls and procedures continue to be effective. The effectiveness of Honeywell’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in the section titled Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. 116 Honeywell International Inc.

Honeywell International Inc. 117 SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS Information relating to security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management and related stockholder matters will be contained in the Proxy Statement, and such information is incorporated herein by reference. EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS As of December 31, 2021, information about our equity compensation plans is as follows: Plan category Number of Securities to be Issued Upon Exercise of Outstanding Options, Warrants and Rights Weighted-Average Exercise Price of Outstanding Options, Warrants and Rights Number of Securities Remaining Available for Future Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans (Excluding Securities Reflected in Column (a)) (a) (b) (c) Equity compensation plans approved by security holders 19,340,042 (1) $ 135.31 (2) 34,886,930 (3) Equity compensation plans not approved by security holders 225,753 (4) N/A (5) N/A (6) Total 19,565,795 $ 135.31 34,886,930 (1) Equity compensation plans approved by shareowners which are included in column (a) of the table are the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan and the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan (including 15,657,151 shares of Common Stock to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options; 2,886,193 RSUs subject to continued employment; 197,586 RSUs at target level and subject to company performance metrics and continued employment; and 415,773 deferred RSUs); and the 2016 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors and the 2006 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors (including 175,104 shares of Common Stock to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options; and 8,235 RSUs subject to continued services). RSUs included in column (a) of the table represent the full number of RSUs awarded and outstanding whereas the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon vesting will be lower than what is reflected on the table because the value of shares required to meet employee tax withholding requirements are not issued. Because the number of future shares that may be distributed to employees participating in the Honeywell Global Stock Plan is unknown, no shares attributable to that plan are included in column (a) of the table above. (2) Column (b) relates to stock options and does not include any exercise price for RSUs because an RSU’s value is dependent upon attainment of certain performance goals and/or continued employment or service and they are settled for shares of Common Stock on a one-for-one basis. (3) The number of shares that may be issued under the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan as of December 31, 2021 is 32,337,638 , which includes the following additional shares that may again be available for issuance: shares that are settled for cash, expire, are canceled, or under similar prior plans, are tendered as option exercise price or tax withholding obligations, are reacquired with cash option exercise price or with monies attributable to any tax deduction to Honeywell upon the exercise of an option, or are under any outstanding awards assumed under any equity compensation plan of an entity acquired by Honeywell. No securities are available for future issuance under the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan. The number of shares that may be issued under the Honeywell Global Stock Plan as of December 31, 2021 is 1,713,993. This plan is an umbrella plan for three plans described below maintained solely for eligible employees of participating non-U.S. countries. • The UK Sharebuilder Plan allows an eligible UK employee to invest taxable earnings in Common Stock. The Company matches those shares and dividends paid are used to purchase additional shares of Common Stock. For the year ended December 31, 2021, 21,228 shares were credited to participants’ accounts under the UK Sharebuilder Plan. • The Honeywell Aerospace Ireland Share Participation Plan and the Honeywell Measurex (Ireland) Limited Group Employee Profit Sharing Plan allow eligible Irish employees to contribute a percentage of base pay and/or bonus that is invested in Common Stock. For the year ended December 31, 2021, 1,059 shares of Common Stock were credited to participants’ accounts under these plans. The remaining 815,299 shares included in column (c) are shares remaining under the 2016 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors. (4) Equity compensation plans not approved by shareowners included in the table refer to the Honeywell Excess Benefit Plan and Supplemental Savings Plan. The Honeywell Excess Benefit Plan and Supplemental Savings Plan for highly compensated employees is an unfunded, non-tax qualified plan that provides benefits equal to the employee deferrals and Company matching allocations that would have been provided under Honeywell’s U.S. tax-qualified savings plan if the Internal Revenue Code limitations on compensation and contributions did not apply. The Company matching contribution is credited to participants’ accounts in the form of notional shares of Common Stock. The notional shares are distributed in the form of actual shares of Common Stock. The number of shares to be issued under this plan based on the value of the notional shares as of December 31, 2021 is 225,753. (5) Column (b) does not include any exercise price for notional shares allocated to employees under Honeywell’s equity compensation plans not approved by shareowners because all of these shares are only settled for shares of Common Stock on a one-for-one basis. (6) The amount of securities available for future issuance under the Honeywell Excess Benefit Plan and Supplemental Savings Plan is not determinable because the number of securities that may be issued under this plan depends upon the amount deferred to the plan by participants in future years. 118 Honeywell International Inc.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Despite a challenging 2020, we continued to deliver on our financial commitments and create long-term shareowner value. Although sales declined 11% to $32.6 billion, our differentiated solutions delivered double-digit sales growth in the defense and space, warehouse automation, PPE and recurring connected software businesses. We adapted to apply Honeywell's capabilities toward addressing the COVID-19 challenges of our customers around the world. Our execution through the downturn demonstrated our ability to move quickly and decisively to reduce fixed costs, ensure liquidity, invest in growth, and position ourselves for recovery, while at the same time, remaining focused on our three transformation initiatives – Honeywell Connected Enterprise, Honeywell Digital, and Integrated Supply Chain. We maintained our commitment to create long-term shareowner value and, despite the downturn, we deployed $7.5 billion to capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases and mergers and acquisitions, which was approximately $1.3 billion in excess of our operating cash flow for the year. Further, we improved our cash and short-term investments by $4.8 billion, which provided stability as well as opportunity for investment during challenging times. As we look forward, we intend to continue deploying capital to high-return opportunities, including software and services with recurring revenue streams, positioning our business for future growth. Orders for our warehouse automation, PPE, and healthy building solutions remain strong, and we carry a robust backlog of $26.4 billion as of December 31, 2020. We are a leading software-industrial company committed to introducing state of the art technology solutions to improve efficiency, productivity and safety in high growth businesses in broad-based, attractive industrial end markets.

Honeywell Forge provides Enterprise Performance Management Software-as-a-Service solutions to help drive operational excellence for our customers, collecting operational data from various assets and organizing data into an ecosystem where it can be useful; • Expanding margins by optimizing the Company’s performance through the Integrated Supply Chain and Honeywell Digital transformation initiatives, commercial excellence, repositioning, and other manufacturing and operational process improvements; • Executing disciplined portfolio management through rigorous merger and acquisition, divestiture, and integration processes to deliver growth and shareholder value; • Controlling corporate costs, including costs incurred for asbestos and environmental matters, and pension and other post-retirement benefits; and • Increasing availability of capital through strong cash flow generation and conversion from effective working capital management and proactive management of debt to enable the Company to strategically deploy capital for acquisitions, dividends, share repurchases and capital expenditures. BACKLOG Our backlog represents the estimated remaining value of work to be performed under firm contracts. Backlog is equal to our remaining performance obligations under the contracts that meet the guidance on revenue from contracts with customers as discussed in Note 3 Revenue Recognition and Contracts with Customers of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Backlog was $26,376 million and $25,612 million at December 31, 2020 and 2019. We expect to recognize approximately 55% of our remaining performance obligations as revenue in 2021, and the remaining balance thereafter. 4 Honeywell International, Inc. U.S. GOVERNMENT SALES The Company, principally through our Aerospace segment, sells to the U.S. Government acting through its various departments and agencies and through prime contractors, including the U.S. Department of Defense (as both a prime contractor and subcontractor). We do not expect our overall operating results to be significantly affected by any proposed changes in 2021 federal defense spending due to the varied mix of the government programs which impact us (OEM production, engineering development programs, aftermarket spares and repairs and overhaul programs), as well as our diversified customer base. U.S. Government Sales Years Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Sales to the U.S. Department of Defense $ 3,661 $ 3,491 $ 2,832 Sales to other U.S. Government departments and agencies 557 566 571 Total Sales to the U.S. Government $ 4,218 $ 4,057 $ 3,403 INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS We engage in manufacturing, sales, service and research and development globally. U.S. exports and non-U.S. manufactured products are significant to our operations. U.S. exports represented 12% of our total sales in 2020, 15% in 2019 and 13% in 2018. Non-U.S. manufactured products and services, mainly in Europe and Asia, were 40% of our total sales in 2020, 40% in 2019 and 43% in 2018. Manufactured Products and Systems and Performance of Services Year Ended December 31, 2020 Aerospace Honeywell Building Technologies Performance Materials and Technologies Safety and Productivity Solutions (% of Segment Sales) U.S. exports 22 % 2 % 13 % 2 % Non-U.S. manufactured products/services 15 % 65 % 58 % 37 % Information related to risks related to our foreign operations is included in the section titled Risk Factors under the caption “Macroeconomic and Industry Risks.” RAW MATERIALS The principal raw materials used in our operations are readily available. Although we occasionally experience disruption in raw materials supply, we experienced no significant problems in the purchase of key raw materials or commodities in 2020. We are not dependent on any one supplier for a material amount of our raw materials. Prices of certain key raw materials, including copper, fluorspar, tungsten salts, ethylene, aluminum, and molybdenum in Performance Materials and Technologies and nickel, steel, titanium and other metals in Aerospace, are expected to fluctuate. We offset raw material cost increases with formula-driven or long-term supply agreements, price increases and hedging activities where feasible. We do not presently anticipate that a shortage of raw materials will cause any material adverse impacts during 2021. PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, LICENSES AND DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS Our segments are not dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents, trademarks, or any licenses or distribution rights. In our judgment, our intellectual property rights are adequate for the conduct of our business. We believe that, in the aggregate, the rights under our patents, trademarks, licenses and distribution rights are generally important to our operations, but we do not consider any individual patent, trademark or any licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process or product to be of material importance in relation to our total business. 5 Honeywell International, Inc. REGULATIONS The Company’s operations are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government regulations, including requirements regarding the protection of human health and the environment. Our policies, practices and procedures are designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage, and of resulting financial liability, in connection with our business. Some risk of environmental damage is, however, inherent in some of our operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses. We engage in the handling, manufacturing, use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous by one or more regulatory agencies. Our policies, practices and procedures are designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury, and to ensure that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of these substances meet or exceed environmental and safety laws and regulations. It is possible that future knowledge or other developments, such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies, could bring into question our current or past handling, manufacture, use or disposal of these substances. Among other environmental requirements, we are subject to the Federal Superfund and similar state and foreign laws and regulations, under which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated with current and former operating sites and various hazardous waste sites, some of which are on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s National Priority List. While there is a possibility that a responsible party might be unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible parties, we do not anticipate having to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multi-party situations taken as a whole. We do not believe that Federal, State and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, or any existing or pending climate change legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on the Company’s business and we will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area. Beyond our compliance requirements with environmental regulations, compliance with other government regulations has not had, and based on laws and regulations currently in effect, is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. See section titled Risk Factors for additional information on government regulation that could impact our business. HUMAN CAPITAL MANAGEMENT We believe a commitment to and investment in human capital management enables better decision making, helps us build competitive advantage, and furthers our long-term success. As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 103,000 employees across 70 countries, 41,000 of whom are in the United States. Human capital management is the key driver of our performance culture, which enables our workforce to respond to the fast-changing needs of our customers. Our performance culture is defined by a set of Honeywell Behaviors (Have a Passion for Winning, Be a Zealot for Growth, Think Big … Then Make It Happen, Act with Urgency, Be Courageous, Become Your Best, Be Committed, and Build Exceptional Talent), which reflect the bold, entrepreneurial spirit of our employees while emphasizing our goal to operate with speed and precision. At their foundation is a commitment to Integrity and Ethics, Inclusion and Diversity, and Workplace Respect, fundamental values that underlie everything we do. Our commitment to these fundamental values and the Honeywell Behaviors starts at the top with a diverse Board of Directors and executive management team, who represent a broad spectrum of backgrounds and perspectives. We believe that the diversity of our current Board of Directors (four women, two Hispanics, and two African Americans) and the diversity of Honeywell’s executive leadership (more than half of the Company’s nine executive officers is diverse by ethnic background or gender) supports our evolving business strategy and is a testament to Honeywell’s ongoing commitment to hiring, developing, and retaining diverse talent. The Company’s commitment to Inclusion and Diversity enables better decision-making, helps build competitive advantages, and furthers long-term success. In 2020, the Company established a Global Inclusion and Diversity Steering Committee co-sponsored by our Chairman and CEO, Senior Vice President and General Counsel, and Senior Vice President and Human Resources and fortified our inclusion and diversity governance structure by embedding Inclusion and Diversity Councils in each of our business groups. The re-designed governance structure provides a scalable model that supports our six affinity group employee networks for women, Black, Hispanic, veteran, LGBTQ, and disabled employees and facilitates the introduction of new networks to reflect the diverse characteristics of our workforce. These networks 6 Honeywell International, Inc. are designed to provide training and development opportunities and expand internal networks for promotional opportunities. In addition, our people managers are expected to model behaviors that promote a culture that is open and inclusive for all employees. We help managers develop this skill as they do any other leadership skill, though training programs, interactive learning and real time events, including the hiring and talent review processes. Our Leadership Edge program provides training in core management skills to more than 13,000 leaders across the organization. Training programs are available to all employees through our internal learning and development platform, which assigns curriculum tailored to an employee’s job responsibilities. Employees can also access additional trainings on-demand to continue to enhance their skills. This year, we also deployed a mandatory unconscious bias training program to our global workforce as a supplement to their other learning opportunities. Our internal talent acquisition and management platform is a key component to recruiting, hiring, and developing top-performing talent. Our hiring practices consider a diverse slate of candidates and our hiring managers are provided training and toolkits to reinforce their role in bringing diverse talent into the Company. Further, we partner with top academic institutions and external professional organizations to enhance the diversity of our workforce to attract and retain top talent. Our talent review process requires our people managers to have quarterly career discussions with each member of their teams to discuss the best opportunity for growth and development, which enhances our identification of candidates for internal promotion and succession planning. Finally, our Code of Business Conduct establishes the baseline requirements of our integrity and compliance program and promotes an environment where everyone is treated ethically and with respect. It outlines our pledge to recognize the dignity of each individual, respect each employee, provide compensation and benefits that are competitive, promote self-development through training, and value diversity of perspectives and ideas. All employees must complete Code of Business Conduct training and, where permitted by law, must also certify each year that they will comply with the Code. In 2020, we received certifications from 100% of officers and employees where permitted by law. Overall, we believe our culture, along with our internal tools and initiatives, enable us to effectively execute our human capital strategy. For discussion on the risks relating to our inability to attract and retain top-performing talent, please see section titled Risk Factors. 7 Honeywell International, Inc.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Dollars in tables and graphs in millions) The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Honeywell International Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (Honeywell or the Company) for the three years ended December 31, 2020. All references to Notes relate to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the section titled Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. On October 1, 2018, we completed the tax-free spin-off to Honeywell shareowners of our Transportation Systems business, previously part of Aerospace, into a standalone publicly-traded company, Garrett Motion Inc. (Garrett). On October 29, 2018, we completed the tax-free spin-off to Honeywell shareowners of our Homes and Global Distribution business, previously part of Home and Building Technologies (renamed Honeywell Building Technologies following the spin-off), into a standalone publicly-traded company, Resideo Technologies, Inc. (Resideo). We removed the assets and liabilities associated with Garrett and Resideo from our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the effective dates of the respective spin-offs. We included the results of operations for Garrett and Resideo in our Consolidated Statement of Operations through the effective dates of the respective spin-offs. Total sales attributable to these spin-offs were $6.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018. A detailed discussion of the prior year 2019 to 2018 year-over-year changes are not included herein and can be found in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section in the 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed February 14 , 20 20 . COVID-19 UPDATE In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) was identified in Asia. Over the next several months, COVID-19 quickly spread across the world. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a worldwide pandemic. As of December 31, 2020, the virus continues to spread and many countries are experiencing a resurgence in infection rates. Although vaccines have recently been made available, the availability and distribution of the vaccines continue to provide challenges. Governments took unprecedented actions to contain the spread of COVID-19, temporarily shutting down non-essential businesses, issuing stay at home or “shelter in place” orders and asking citizens to avoid all non-essential travel. In certain situations, governments closed borders and issued mandatory quarantines. Companies were asked, and in many cases were required, to allow non-essential employees to work remotely. Consumer spending declined, global travel demand declined significantly, and the world entered a global recession. These events impacted our business operations in multiple ways. In the first quarter of 2020, we quickly responded to the changing environment. In January 2020, we implemented policies in select countries within Asia to restrict travel and require employees to work from home for all roles that allow for remote work. In March 2020, we expanded this work from home policy to include our employees worldwide. We introduced appropriate safety and hygiene protocols to enable our manufacturing employees to operate safely through the pandemic. We actively monitored the changing government rules and regulations for each of our locations worldwide. We remain cautious as many factors remain unpredictable, including the increasing rate of COVID-19 infections. We continue to monitor COVID-19 infection rates globally and acknowledge the risk of new surges in COVID-19 infections. We prepared procedures for the phased return of our employees to office sites and trained our local site leaders in the appropriate safety and hygiene protocols. As of December 31, 2020, all of our manufacturing sites continue to operate and, outside of India, most of our employees in Asia have returned to the workplace in some capacity. We also returned small numbers of workers to select office sites within Europe and North America. In many countries, including the U.S., most of our non-manufacturing employees continue to work from home (for all roles that allow for remote work). 9 Honeywell International, Inc. The global recession resulted in a slow-down in demand for many of the products and services that we offer. The impact on each of our businesses is outlined below: • Aerospace – The decline in global travel negatively impacted many of our customers, resulting in lower demand for our products from OEMs and negatively impacted demand for our commercial aftermarket businesses. As a result, this segment's sales and profits declined for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. • Performance Materials and Technologies – Many of our customers operate in the oil and gas industry. The decline in global travel, coupled with excessive oil and gas supply, negatively impacted many of our customers and resulted in lower demand for our products. As a result, this segment's sales and profits declined for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. • Honeywell Building Technologies – Our customers own or manage buildings in a variety of industries including commercial real estate, hospitality, government, healthcare, banking and education. The global recession impacted many of these industries, resulting in a reduction of discretionary spending. As a result, this segment's sales and profits declined for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. • Safety and Productivity Solutions – The global pandemic created significant demand for our respiratory PPE and warehouse automation driving increases in this segment's sales and profits for the year ended December 31, 2020, compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. As a result of the slowdown in demand for our products, we implemented several cost reduction programs across our enterprise. We canceled our 2020 merit increases and reduced executive and Board of Director compensation. We initiated reduced work schedules across the company and implemented permanent census reductions. We also took several steps to secure additional liquidity. In March 2020, we entered into a $6.0 billion Delayed Draw Term Loan Agreement. In May 2020, we completed a public Senior Notes offering, which provided $3.0 billion of available liquidity and permanently reduced the undrawn commitments under the Delayed Draw Term Loan Agreement by $3.0 billion. In June 2020, we drew on the remaining $3.0 billion of commitments under the Delayed Draw Term Loan Agreement. In August 2020, we completed a public Senior Notes offering, which provided $3.0 billion of available liquidity and was used to repay the outstanding principal amount of $3.0 billion under the Delayed Draw Term Loan Agreement. As of December 31, 2020, there are no outstanding borrowings or commitments remaining under the Delayed Draw Term Loan Agreement. Further, we held $15.2 billion of available cash and cash equivalents, including short-term investments. We continue to monitor and respond to the changing conditions created by the pandemic. Employee Health, Safety, and Economic Wellness We continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation and its impacts globally. We are prioritizing the health and safety of our employees. Out of an abundance of caution for the health of our employees and to support local government initiatives to stem the spread of the virus, we implemented several precautions at various sites around the world at all times in compliance with local government requirements and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines. These include, but are not limited to: • Limiting visitor site access to business-essential purposes; • Introducing screening checks at certain sites where permissible or mandated; • Enabling employees to work from home wherever and whenever required or appropriate; • Continuously updating travel guidance, according to latest developments; and • Complying with all local health authority guidance or regulations and our own protocols, including requesting employees to comply with self-quarantine requirements whenever advisable. We have taken a number of measures to support our employees during these difficult times. We extended medical benefits globally to cover out-of-pocket costs associated with testing for coronavirus, and for those on our U.S. company medical plans, we are also covering treatment costs. In Mexico, we introduced a medical benefit for employees at lower compensation levels to ensure access to private medical treatment. In the U.S., we changed our sick leave plan for non-exempt employees to make more sick time available earlier in the year if it is needed. We established a $10 million company-funded relief fund targeting employees worldwide at lower compensation levels, especially those on reduced work hours who did not receive high levels of income replacement from unemployment or other government assistance. 10 Honeywell International, Inc. In addition to the measures to assist our employees, Honeywell contributed $2 million to establish a Small Business Innovation Fund in Charlotte to help our local economy. The fund helps storefront businesses with 50 or fewer employees make investments in new technologies and business models to adjust to the realities of operating in the COVID-19 environment. The fund prioritizes businesses owned by women, minorities and veterans. Our Commitment to Public Health In a partnership with the State of North Carolina and other local businesses, we announced a goal to deliver 1 million COVID-19 vaccines in North Carolina by July 4, 2021. In Phoenix, where our Aerospace business is headquartered, we will sponsor a week-long vaccination program in February 2021. In addition, Honeywell funded the provision of approximately 10 million meals and a month’s supply of hygiene kits to families in India suffering hardships due to the crisis. As we produce critical worker safety gear such as face masks, gloves, goggles, safety suits, and protective footwear, we play an essential role in the health and well-being of people and economies. To date, Honeywell has donated more than 2 million masks to frontline workers across multiple regions. Our customers and communities are depending on us more than ever to deliver for them and we are committed to supporting the safety of our employees, customers and fellow citizens around the world. We are investing in new production facilities and continue to expand existing facilities to increase production of essential PPE products. We will bring these products to market as quickly as possible. We are committed to healthcare professionals, first responders, distributors and other stakeholders in an effort to ensure our PPE products are being placed quickly and cost-effectively in the hands of those most in need. We announced our new capacity in the U.S. to make N95 masks, with production lines added in Rhode Island and Arizona that will collectively produce 40 million masks each month to support health, safety, and response workers globally. In addition, we are expanding our non-U.S. capacity with a new mask manufacturing line in the UK that is expected to produce 4.5 million masks each month, and a new line in India that is expected to produce 2 million masks each month. Separately, we are collaborating with Mubadala Investment Company's subsidiary, Strata Manufacturing, in the UAE to produce 30 million masks annually. We have communicated the following principles to our authorized distributor network: • Our expectation that, at a minimum, all of our partners will comply with all applicable laws prohibiting price gouging and apply appropriate diligence to the greatest extent possible to understand how our products are being purchased so that they are placed quickly and cost-effectively in the hands of those most in need - including first responders and medical professionals. • While we do not control the prices that third parties set, we expect our partners to fairly price PPE used in the COVID-19 response effort. • If we find that one of our partners is not upholding the letter or spirit of these principles, we reserve the right not to fulfill that partner’s orders and terminate our relationship with that party. We are also investing in developing and bringing to market a wide array of new COVID-related products, including but not limited to Healthy Buildings solutions, remote operations offerings, automation technologies to help speed vaccine development, vaccine packaging solutions, an ultraviolet cleaning system for aircraft, innovative dual-layer face covers and safety packs. Plant Productivity and Safety In situations where our businesses were deemed essential, we worked with local officials to determine how to safely operate our manufacturing facilities. We successfully operated these manufacturing facilities with minimal disruption in our productivity. In the second quarter of 2020, we repurposed certain manufacturing facilities to produce PPE that was in short supply around the world. As of December 31, 2020, more than 95% of our manufacturing sites were operating at normal production levels. We continue to provide essential services and produce essential goods around the world. We employ standards such as screening checks, use of masks, face coverings and other safety equipment and social distancing practices along production lines in our production facilities at all times in compliance with local government requirements and CDC guidelines. We take appropriate actions including disinfecting and quarantine procedures when a suspected COVID-19 case is identified. 11 Honeywell International, Inc. Customers and Suppliers Current global economic conditions due to COVID-19 have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our customers’ and suppliers’ ability to operate or obtain financing, particularly in our airline, oil and gas, and automotive end markets. Customer or supplier bankruptcies, delays in their ability to obtain financing, or the unavailability of financing could adversely affect our cash flow or results of operations. We continue to actively monitor both supplier and customer financial health and take measures to manage our supply chain disruptions and limit our exposure.

CONSOLIDATED OPERATING RESULTS Net Sales The change in net sales was attributable to the following: 2020 Versus 2019 2019 Versus 2018 Volume (12) % 3 % Price 1 % 2 % Foreign Currency Translation — % (1) % Acquisitions/Divestitures — % (16) % (11) % (12) % 2020 compared with 2019 A discussion of net sales by segment can be found in the Review of Business Segments section of this Management Discussion and Analysis. The unfavorable volume in 2020 was driven by: • Lower sales across our businesses due to the impact of the global recession attributable to COVID-19 and volatility in the oil and gas industry, • Partially offset by strength in respiratory PPE products, warehouse automation projects, and defense and space. 15 Honeywell International, Inc. Cost of Products and Services Sold 2020 compared with 2019 Cost of products and services sold decreased in 2020 primarily due to the following: • Lower direct and indirect material costs by approximately $1,130 million and $310 million, • Lower labor costs by approximately $800 million, driven by lower sales volumes and other cost actions to improve productivity. Gross Margin 2020 compared with 2019 Gross margin percentage decreased in 2020 primarily due to the following: • Lower gross margin in the Performance Materials and Technologies, Aerospace, and Safety and Productivity Solutions segments, • Partially offset by higher Honeywell Building Technologies gross margin. 16 Honeywell International, Inc. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 2020 compared with 2019 Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased due to higher productivity, including lower costs resulting from repositioning actions. Other (Income) Expense 2020 2019 2018 Other (income) expense $ (675) $ (1,065) $ (1,149) 2020 compared with 2019 Other (income) expense changed due to the following: • Non-cash charges associated with the reduction in value of reimbursement receivables due from Garrett, • Lower interest income, and • Lower foreign exchange income, • Partially offset by higher pension income, higher equity income of affiliated companies and higher other postretirement income. 17 Honeywell International, Inc. Tax Expense 2020 compared with 2019 The effective tax rate for 2020 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the favorable resolution of a foreign tax matter related to the previously completed spin-off transactions, tax impact of restructuring, tax law changes in India, and the resolution of certain U.S. tax matters offset by accrued withholding taxes related to unremitted foreign earnings and non-cash charges related to the reduction of the aggregate carrying value of certain receivables with no corresponding tax benefit. The effective tax rate for 2019 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily resulting from the impacts of revised guidance related to U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and internal restructuring initiatives that resulted in a $281 million reduction of accrued withholding taxes related to unremitted foreign earnings. For further discussion of changes in the effective tax rate, see Note 5 Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Net Income Attributable to Honeywell 2020 compared with 2019 Earnings per share of common stock–assuming dilution decreased due to the following: • Lower segment profit due to the impact of the global recession attributable to COVID-19 and volatility in the oil and gas industry, • Non-cash charges associated with the reduction in value of reimbursement receivables due from Garrett, and • Lower interest income, lower foreign exchange income, and higher repositioning costs, • Partially offset by lower income taxes, higher pension income, and the favorable impact of lower outstanding share count resulting from the Company's stock repurchases. 18 Honeywell International, Inc.

REPOSITIONING CHARGES See Note 4 Repositioning and Other Charges of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our repositioning actions and related charges incurred in 2020, 2019 and 2018. Cash spending related to our repositioning actions was $ 564 million, $249 million and $285 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, and was funded through operating cash flows. RISK FACTORS Our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition are subject to the material risks and uncertainties set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. MACROECONOMIC AND INDUSTRY RISKS Each of our businesses is subject to unique industry and economic conditions that may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations. • Aerospace —Our Aerospace business is impacted by customer buying patterns of aftermarket parts, supplier stability, factory transitions and global supply chain capacity constraints that may lead to shortages of crucial components. Operating results may be adversely affected by downturns in the global demand for air travel, which may impact new aircraft production or result in the delay or cancellation of new aircraft orders, delays in launch schedules for new aircraft, the retirement of aircraft and reductions in global flying hours, which impacts air transport and regional, business and general aviation aircraft utilization rates. Operating results may also be adversely affected by any decrease in air travel demand due to regional restrictions or suspension of service for public health, safety, or environmental events, such as the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which negatively impacted our operating results during 2020. Operating results could also be impacted by changes in overall trends related to end market demand for the product portfolio, as well as new entrants and non-traditional players entering the market. Operating results in our Defense and Space business unit may be affected by the mix of U.S. and foreign government appropriations for defense and space programs and by compliance risks. Results may also be impacted by the potential introduction of counterfeit parts into our global supply chain. • Honeywell Building Technologies —Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in the level of global commercial construction activity (including retrofits and upgrades), lower capital spending and operating expenditures on building projects, decreased industrial plant expansion, changes in the competitive landscape including new market entrants and new technologies, and fluctuations in inventory levels in distribution channels. 24 Honeywell International, Inc. • Performance Materials and Technologies —Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, refining, petrochemical and semiconductor plants, our customers’ availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion, raw material demand and supply, product commoditization, continued illegal imports of hydrofluorocarbons into Europe and our ability to maximize our facilities’ production capacity and minimize downtime. Periods of increased volatility in oil and natural gas prices may result in less investment by our customers and therefore, lower demand for our products and services. • Safety and Productivity Solutions —Operating results may be adversely impacted by reduced investments in process automation, safety monitoring, and plant capacity utilization initiatives, fluctuations in retail markets, a slowdown in demand for safety products, changes in the competitive landscape, including new market entrants and technology that may lead to product commoditization, and adverse industry economic conditions, all of which could result in lower market share, reduced selling prices and lower margins. The global COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic and related impacts adversely affect and may continue to adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flow. The global spread of coronavirus (COVID-19) creates significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption that impacts our business, operations and financial results and may continue to do so. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including: the duration, scope and severity of the pandemic, including the extent of the continued increase in cases across the United States in particular, as well as the timing and availability of effective medical treatments and vaccines; governmental, business and individual decisions and actions; the pace of vaccine deployment; the impact of the pandemic on economic activity; and the extent to which we or our employees, customers, suppliers, service providers or other business partners may be prevented from conducting normal business activities, including due to shutdowns or other restrictive measures that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities. These factors could, among other things, continue to disrupt (i) the purchasing, contracting and payment behaviors of our customers and their end-users; (ii) our operations, including our manufacturing activities, the shipment of our products, and the performance of our suppliers and service providers; and (iii) our liquidity and cash flow. Risks arising from the COVID-19 pandemic impacting our business and that may continue to impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects include, among other things: • Customer Risk —Existing and potential customers and their end-users may continue to take actions to reduce or suspend operations, reduce or delay spending, cancel contracts, or cut costs in a manner that reduces demand for our products and services. In particular, lower demand for air travel may continue to cause our customers to delay or suspend spending in connection with the manufacturing, repair, overhaul or servicing of aircraft, and there may be long-term deterioration in demand for air travel that could impact our business beyond the current COVID-19 health crisis. Customers may also continue to attempt to renegotiate contracts and obtain concessions, face financial constraints on their ability to make payments to us on a timely basis or at all, or enter into bankruptcy or discontinue their business operations, and we may continue to be required to discount the pricing of our products. In addition, unfavorable customer site conditions, such as closure of or access restrictions to customer facilities, and disruptions to our customers’ third-party logistics, warehousing, inventory management and distribution services may continue to limit our ability to sell products, meet billing milestones or provide services. • Operations Risk —The closure of our facilities, restrictions inhibiting our employees’ ability to access those facilities, and disruptions to the ability of our suppliers or service providers to deliver goods or services to us (including as a result of supplier facility closures or access restrictions, disruptions to their supply chains, and supplier liquidity or bankruptcy risk) could further disrupt our ability to provide our services and solutions and result in, among other things, terminations of customer contracts and losses of revenue. Because the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our near-term and long-term revenues, earnings, liquidity and cash flows, we have taken and may be required to redeploy significant cost actions, including but not limited to reducing discretionary expenses (such as non-essential travel, contractors, and consultants), reducing hiring, canceling annual merit increases, reducing executive and board of director pay, reducing work schedules across the enterprise, shortening or staggering work schedules to match production with demand, and reducing staffing levels, as well as increasing supplier-based productivity and enhancing spending-limit controls. However, the extent to which our mitigation efforts are successful, if at all, is not currently ascertainable; also, our costs may not decrease at the same pace as revenue declines 25 Honeywell International, Inc. as many of our costs are less variable in nature, and we may not be able to or may not choose to significantly reduce them in an effort to remain focused on long-term outlook and growth opportunities. Further, our management of the impact of COVID-19 will continue to require significant investment of time from our management and employees, as well as resources across our global enterprise. The focus on managing and mitigating the impacts of COVID-19 on our business may cause us to divert or delay the application of our resources toward new initiatives or investments, which may adversely impact our future results of operations. Issues relating to the COVID-19 pandemic may also result in legal claims or litigation against us. In addition, remote work has increased the frequency of cybersecurity attacks, including phishing and malware attempts that utilize COVID-19-related strategies, increasing the risk of a material cybersecurity incident that could result in the loss of proprietary or personal data, render us more vulnerable to future cybersecurity attacks, disrupt our operations, or otherwise cause us reputational or financial harm. • Liquidity and Cash Flow Risk —Because of the customer and operations risks described above, our business may not continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may need to use existing cash balances to service our debt, and if such balances are insufficient, then we may be required to engage in one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring of existing debt, issuing new debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Due to the daily evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic and the responses to curb its spread, we cannot predict the ultimate impact the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flow. Any recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic impact may be slowed or reversed by a variety of factors, such as, in the United States, the current widespread increase in COVID-19 infections. In addition, even after the COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of its global economic impact, including the current recession and any recession that may occur in the future. Further, many of the factors disclosed under Risk Factors in this Form 10-K are, and we anticipate will continue to be further, heightened or exacerbated by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. A significant percentage of our sales and operations is in non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory, foreign exchange and other risks of international operations. Our international operations, including U.S. exports, represent more than half of the Company’s sales. Risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations, wage and price controls, antitrust regulations, employment regulations, foreign investment laws, import, export and other trade restrictions (such as sanctions and embargoes), differing levels of protection of intellectual property, acts of industrial espionage, violations by our employees of anti-corruption laws (despite our efforts to mitigate such risk), changes in regulations regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private enterprises, acts of terrorism, and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions. Instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment and the evolving international and domestic political, regulatory and economic landscape, including the potential for changes in global trade policies, including sanctions and trade barriers, and trends such as populism, economic nationalism and negative sentiment toward multinational companies, as well as the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide, can impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins. In December 2020, the United Kingdom and the European Union announced they had entered into a post-Brexit deal on certain aspects of trade and other strategic and political issues. Depending on the application of the terms of the trade and cooperation agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union, we could face increased regulatory costs and challenges. The Company has developed plans to mitigate the potential impact of these costs and challenges, but the implications of these uncertainties could affect the Company's business, financial position and results of operations. Existing free trade laws and regulations provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products or from where we import products or raw materials, either directly or through our suppliers, could have an impact on our competitive position and financial results. The United States has commenced certain trade actions, including imposing tariffs on certain goods imported from China and other countries, which has resulted in retaliatory tariffs by China and other countries. Additional 26 Honeywell International, Inc. tariffs imposed by the United States on a broader range of imports, or further retaliatory trade measures taken by China or other countries in response, could increase the cost of our products. Given the change in the U.S. presidential administration, we face uncertainty with regard to U.S. government trade policy. Operating outside of the United States also exposes us to foreign exchange risk, which we monitor and seek to reduce through hedging activities. However, foreign exchange hedging activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us or be successful in eliminating such volatility. Finally, we generate significant amounts of cash outside of the United States that is invested with financial and non-financial counterparties. While we employ comprehensive controls regarding global cash management to guard against cash or investment loss and to ensure our ability to fund our operations and commitments, a material disruption to the counterparties with whom we transact business could expose Honeywell to financial loss. Operating outside the United States also exposes us to additional intellectual property risk. The laws and enforcement practices of certain jurisdictions in which we operate may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the U.S. and may impose joint venture, technology transfer, local service or other foreign investment requirements and restrictions that potentially compromise control over our technology and proprietary information. Failure of foreign jurisdictions to protect our intellectual property rights, an inability to effectively enforce such rights in foreign jurisdictions, or the imposition of foreign jurisdiction investment or sourcing restrictions or requirements could result in loss of valuable proprietary information and could impact our competitive position and financial results. Risks related to our defined benefit pension plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow. Significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets, discount rates, and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and require cash pension contributions in future periods. Changes in discount rates and actual asset returns different than our anticipated asset returns can result in significant non-cash actuarial gains or losses, which we record in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and, if applicable, in any quarter in which an interim re-measurement is triggered. With regard to cash pension contributions, funding requirements for our pension plans are largely dependent upon interest rates, actual investment returns on pension assets and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations. OPERATIONAL RISKS Raw material price fluctuations, the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements, or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services, impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities. The cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products, particularly in Performance Materials and Technologies (copper, fluorspar, tungsten salts, ethylene, aluminum, and molybdenum) and in Aerospace (nickel, steel, titanium and other metals). Our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices to customers, formula-driven or long-term fixed price contracts with suppliers, productivity actions or commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations. Many major components, product equipment items and raw materials, particularly in Aerospace, are procured or subcontracted on a single or sole-source basis. Although we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process and we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate, it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases may have in the future. Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers’ inability to scale production and adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile demand. In addition, current or future global economic uncertainty, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, may affect the financial stability of our key suppliers or their access to financing, which may in turn affect their ability to perform their obligations to us. If one or more of our suppliers experiences financial difficulties, delivery delays or other performance problems, our resulting inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts, which could, in turn, result in reduced sales and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships. 27 Honeywell International, Inc. We may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions, and divestitures may not occur as planned. We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest non-core businesses. We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by (i) the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns, including risk of impairment; (ii) the failure to integrate multiple acquired businesses into Honeywell simultaneously and on schedule and/or to achieve expected synergies; (iii) the inability to dispose of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions; and (iv) the discovery of unanticipated liabilities, labor relations difficulties, cybersecurity concerns, compliance issues or other problems in acquired businesses for which we lack contractual protections, insurance or indemnities, or, with regard to divested businesses, claims by purchasers to whom we have provided contractual indemnification. Our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance in increasingly competitive markets with acceptable margins. Our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to (i) identify and evolve with emerging technological and broader industry trends in our target end-markets; (ii) develop and maintain competitive products; (iii) defend our market share against an ever-expanding number of competitors, including many new and non-traditional competitors; (iv) enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products; (v) develop, manufacture and bring compelling new products to market quickly and cost-effectively; (vi) monitor disruptive technologies and business models; (vii) achieve sufficient return on investment for new products introduced based on capital expenditures and research and development spending; (viii) respond to changes in overall trends related to end-market demand; and (ix) attract, develop and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customers’ needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products. Competitors may also develop after-market services and parts for our products which attract customers and adversely affect our return on investment for new products. The failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors or the failure to address any of the above factors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects. Failure to increase productivity through sustainable operational improvements, as well as an inability to successfully execute repositioning projects or to effectively manage our workforce, may reduce our profitability or adversely impact our businesses. Our profitability and margin growth are dependent upon our ability to drive sustainable improvements. We seek productivity and cost savings benefits through repositioning actions and projects, such as consolidation of manufacturing facilities, transitions to cost-competitive regions and product line rationalizations. Risks associated with these actions include delays in execution, additional unexpected costs, realization of fewer than estimated productivity improvements and adverse effects on employee morale. We may not realize the full operational or financial benefits we expect, the recognition of these benefits may be delayed, and these actions may potentially disrupt our operations. In addition, organizational changes, increased attrition, failure to create and implement a succession plan for key Company positions, not retaining key talent, inability to attract new employees with unique skills, labor relations difficulties, or workforce stoppage could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position and results of operations. As a supplier to the U.S. Government, we are subject to unique risks, such as the right of the U.S. Government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance. U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform consistent with the terms of the applicable contract. Our contracts with the U.S. Government are also subject to government audits that may recommend downward price adjustments and other changes. When appropriate and prudent, we made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in the past and may do so in the future. 28 Honeywell International, Inc. We are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement and security regulations. If, as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations (including investigation of violations of certain environmental, employment or export laws), Honeywell or one of its businesses were found to have violated applicable law, then it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings and/or have its export privileges suspended. Our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities. Mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. We continue to incur remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. Various federal, state, local and foreign governments regulate the use of certain materials, the discharge of materials into the environment, and/or communications respecting certain materials in our products, and can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations, and require injunctive relief measures, including installation of costly equipment, implementation of operational changes to limit emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases, or limiting access of our products to markets, among others. In addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement of policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites, the establishment of stricter toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur additional costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations. Global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology (IT) systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company, its products, its customers and/or its third party service providers, including cloud providers. Our customers, including the U.S. Government, are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products, and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats and incidents, none of them to date have been material to the Company. We seek to deploy comprehensive measures to deter, prevent, detect, respond to and mitigate these threats, including identity and access controls, data protection, vulnerability assessments, continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems. Despite these efforts, cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include financial loss, reputational damage, litigation with third parties, theft of intellectual property, fines levied by the Federal Trade Commission, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs due to the increasing sophistication and proliferation of threats, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations. 29 Honeywell International, Inc. The development of technology products and services presents security and safety risks. An increasing number of our products, services and technologies are delivered with Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities and the accompanying interconnected device networks, which include sensors, data and advanced computing capabilities. We have developed product software designs that we believe are less susceptible to cyber-attacks, but despite these efforts, if our products and services that include IoT solutions do not work as intended or are compromised, the possible consequences include financial loss, reputational damage, exposure to legal claims or enforcement actions, theft of intellectual property, and diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations. Data privacy, data protection, and information security may require significant resources and present certain risks. We collect, store, have access to and otherwise process certain confidential or sensitive data, including proprietary business information, personal data or other information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and/or customer-imposed controls. Despite our efforts to protect such data, we may be vulnerable to material security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming errors, or employee errors that could potentially lead to the compromising of such data, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions. In addition, we operate in an environment in which there are different and potentially conflicting data privacy laws in effect in the various U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and we must understand and comply with each law and standard in each of these jurisdictions while ensuring the data is secure. For example, the State of California recently passed legislation granting residents certain new data privacy rights and regulating the security of IoT devices, effective in January 2020, and California voters recently approved additional privacy legislation, which provides for the establishment of a California privacy regulator, modifies the current data privacy regulations and imposes additional data protection obligations and is effective in January 2023; European laws require us to have an approved legal mechanism to transfer personal data out of Europe; the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, which became enforceable in May 2018, superseded prior European Union data protection legislation and imposes more stringent requirements in how we collect and process personal data and provides for significantly greater penalties for noncompliance; and several other states and countries have passed or are considering laws that require personal data relating to their residents or citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions. Government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business, and violations of data privacy laws can result in fines, reputational damage and civil lawsuits, any of which may adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements. A material disruption of our operations, particularly at our manufacturing facilities or within our information technology infrastructure, could adversely affect our business. Our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to natural disasters, including hurricanes and floods, power outages, fires, explosions, terrorism, equipment failures, sabotage, cyber incidents, any potential effects of climate change and adverse weather conditions, labor disputes, critical supply failure, inaccurate downtime forecast, political disruption, and other reasons, which can result in undesirable consequences, including financial losses and damaged relationships with customers. Another public health crises, like a regional or global pandemic, including the COVID-19 pandemic, could again disrupt our supply chain, distribution channels, production facilities, operations and customer demand, which could negatively impact our operations and adversely affect our business. We employ information technology systems and networks to support the business and rely on them to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. Disruptions to our information technology infrastructure from system failures, shutdowns, power outages, telecommunication or utility failures, cybersecurity incidents, and other events, including disruptions at our cloud computing, server, systems and other third party IT service providers, could interfere with our operations, interrupt production and shipments, damage customer and business partner relationships, and negatively impact our reputation. 30 Honeywell International, Inc. Concentrations of credit, counterparty and market risk may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We maintain long-term contractual relationships with many of our customers, suppliers, and other counterparties. While we monitor the financial health of these counterparties, we are exposed to credit and market risks of such counterparties, including those concentrated in the same or similar industries and geographic regions. Changes in economic conditions, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting recession, could also lead to concerns about the creditworthiness of counterparties in the same or similar industry or geography, impacting our ability to renew our long-term contractual arrangements or collect amounts due under these arrangements. Among other factors, changes in economic conditions could also result in the credit deterioration or insolvency of a significant counterparty. Garrett is currently subject to bankruptcy proceedings in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. We have recorded an adjustment against the receivable amounts owed to us under agreements with Garrett, and depending on developments, we may be required to record an additional adjustment in whole or in part (together with a related statement of operations charge) in a future period or periods. We regularly review the aggregate carrying value of the reimbursement receivable amounts due from Garrett in connection with our indemnification and reimbursement agreement and our tax matters agreement with Garrett. On September 20, 2020, Garrett and certain of its affiliates filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the Bankruptcy Court). On January 11, 2021, Garrett accepted, in the bankruptcy proceedings, a revised agreement, originally proposed by Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. (Oaktree) and Centerbridge Partners, L.P. (Centerbridge), in coordination with Honeywell, and subsequently signed by additional equity holders that, collectively with the Company, Oaketree, and Centerbridge, represent approximately 58% of Garrett's outstanding common stock and noteholders representing approximately 88% of the principal amount outstanding on Garrett's senior notes (the Final COH Plan). Based on the Final COH Plan, we believe the present value of payments to us under the Final COH Plan are an appropriate estimate of receivable amounts due in connection with the indemnification and reimbursement agreement and the tax matters agreement. There can be no assurance that the Final COH Plan will be confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court or that Garrett will be able to substantially consummate the restructuring transactions contemplated in the Final COH Plan. The ultimate outcome of the bankruptcy process is uncertain. Should any of these assumptions change and depending on the transaction and/or plan of reorganization ultimately approved by the Bankruptcy Court, the amount collected could differ from the receivable amounts currently recorded in our financial statements. There can be no assurance that recording an additional adjustment (positive or negative) against the remaining receivable amounts in whole or in part (together with a related statement of operations charge) will not be necessary in a future period or periods. See Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details. LEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS Our U.S. and non-U.S. tax liabilities are dependent, in part, upon the distribution of income among various jurisdictions in which we operate. Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws, regulations and judicial rulings (or changes in the interpretation thereof), potential taxation of digital services, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures and various other governmental enforcement initiatives. Our tax expense includes estimates of tax reserves and reflects other estimates and assumptions, including assessments of future earnings of the Company, which could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets. 31 Honeywell International, Inc. Changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations. The sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations, including environmental, safety, performance and product certification regulations. Within Aerospace, the operating results of Commercial Original Equipment and Commercial Aftermarket may be impacted by, among other things, mandates of the Federal Aviation Administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft. Our Defense and Space business unit may be affected by changes in government procurement regulations. Within Honeywell Building Technologies and Safety and Productivity Solutions, the demand for and cost of providing products, services and solutions can be impacted by fire, security, safety, health care, environmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations. Performance Materials and Technologies’ results of operations can be impacted by environmental standards, regulations, and judicial determinations . Growth in all our businesses within emerging markets may be adversely impacted by the inability to acquire and retain qualified employees where local employment law mandates may be restrictive. Changes in such regulations and government policies could negatively impact us; for instance, noncompliance with legislation and regulations can result in fines and penalties, and compliance with any new regulations or policies may be burdensome and/or require significant expenditures. Increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in more international, regional and/or federal or other stakeholder requirements or expectations that could mandate more restrictive or expansive standards, such as stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions or more prescriptive reporting of environmental, social, and governance metrics, than the voluntary commitments that the Company has adopted or require such changes on a more accelerated time frame. There continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty; however, under the new U.S. presidential administration, there likely will be renewed interest in such legislation. If environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the Company or its products, they could negatively impact the Company’s business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters, government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties. We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employment, employee benefits plans, intellectual property, antitrust, anti-corruption, accounting, import and export, and environmental, health and safety matters. Our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities. The incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS Information relating to market risks is included within Liquidity and Capital Resources of our Form 10-K under the caption “Financial Instruments”. 32 Honeywell International, Inc. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES (Dollars in tables in millions) We continue to manage our businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of liquidity. Each of our businesses is focused on increasing operating cash flows through revenue growth, margin expansion and improved working capital turnover. Additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short-term debt from the commercial paper market, long-term borrowings, access to the public debt and equity markets, U.S. cash balances and the ability to access non-U.S. cash as a result of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. CASH We monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis. Our emphasis is primarily safety of principal and secondarily maximizing yield of those funds. We diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we held $15.2 billion and $10.4 billion, respectively, of cash and cash equivalents, including our short-term investments. BORROWINGS Consolidated total borrowings were $22.4 billion and $16.0 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. In response to COVID-19, the Company took several actions during 2020 to secure liquidity in light of the uncertainty in economic conditions and the credit markets, including a $6.0 billion Delayed Draw Term Loan and a total of $7.1 billion raised through Senior Note offerings. See Note 10 Long-term Debt and Credit Agreements of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of the actions taken by the Company to improve our short-term and long-term liquidity position in response to COVID-19. December 31, 2020 2019 Commercial paper and other short-term borrowings $ 3,597 $ 3,516 Variable rate notes 1,122 622 Fixed rate notes 17,399 11,586 Other 266 278 Total borrowings $ 22,384 $ 16,002 A source of liquidity is our ability to access the commercial paper market. Commercial paper notes are sold at a discount or premium and have a maturity of not more than 365 days from date of issuance. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing acquisitions. The weighted average interest rate on commercial paper and other short-term borrowings outstanding was 0.27% and (0.37%) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. We also have the following revolving credit agreements: • A $1.5 billion 364-Day Credit Agreement (the 364-Day Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks, dated April 10, 2020. This 364-Day Credit Agreement is maintained for general corporate purposes. The 364-Day Credit Agreement replaced the 364-day credit agreement dated as of April 26, 2019, which was terminated on April 10, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, there were no outstanding borrowings under our 364-Day Credit Agreement. • A $4.0 billion Five Year Credit Agreement (the 5-Year Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks, dated April 26, 2019. This 5-Year Credit Agreement is maintained for general corporate purposes. Commitments under the 5-Year Credit Agreement can be increased pursuant to the terms of the 5-Year Credit Agreement to an aggregate amount not to exceed $4.5 billion. As of December 31, 2020, there were no outstanding borrowings under our 5-Year Credit Agreement. 33 Honeywell International, Inc. We also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the SEC under which we may issue additional debt securities, common stock and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. We anticipate that net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of existing indebtedness, share repurchases, capital expenditures and acquisitions. CREDIT RATINGS Our ability to access the global debt capital markets and the related cost of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. Our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debt-rating agencies. As of December 31, 2020, S&P, Fitch, and Moody’s have ratings on our debt set forth in the table below: S&P Fitch Moody's Outlook Stable Stable Stable Short-term A-1 F1 P1 Long-term A A A2 CASH FLOW SUMMARY Our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, are summarized as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Cash provided by (used for): Operating activities $ 6,208 $ 6,897 $ 6,434 Investing activities (987) (533) 1,027 Financing activities (81) (6,600) (5,032) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 68 16 (201) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 5,208 $ (220) $ 2,228 2020 compared with 2019 Cash provided by operating activities decreased by $689 million primarily due to lower net income of $1,364 million, partially offset by a favorable impact from working capital of $588 million (favorable accounts receivable and inventory, partially offset by accounts payable). Cash used for investing activities increased by $454 million primarily due to a $251 million increase in payments related to settlements of derivative contracts, $211 million increase in cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and $67 million increase in capital expenditures, partially offset by a net decrease in investments of $61 million. Cash used for financing activities decreased by $6,519 million primarily due to a $7,399 million increase in proceeds from the issuance of long-term debt and a $686 million decrease in repurchases of common stock, partially offset by an increase in payments of long-term debt of $1,405 million. CASH REQUIREMENTS AND ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT LIQUIDITY In addition to our normal operating cash requirements, our principal future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends, strategic acquisitions and debt repayments. Specifically, we expect our primary cash requirements in 2021 to be as follows: • Capital expenditures—we expect to spend approximately $1 billion for capital expenditures in 2021 primarily for growth, production and capacity expansion, implementation of cost reduction measures, maintenance, and replacement. 34 Honeywell International, Inc. • Share repurchases—under our share repurchase program, $3.3 billion was available as of December 31, 2020 for additional share repurchases. We expect to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock-based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. Additionally, we will seek to reduce share count via share repurchases as and when attractive opportunities arise. The amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and our level of operating, financing and other investing activities. • Dividends—we increased our quarterly dividend rate by 3% to $0.93 per share of common stock effective with the fourth quarter 2020 dividend. We intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends in 2021. We continue to identify opportunities to improve our liquidity and working capital efficiency, which includes the extension of payment terms with our suppliers. In addition, multiple third-party financial institutions offer a voluntary supply chain financing (SCF) program which enables our suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables from the Company to these financial institutions on terms that are negotiated between the supplier and the respective financial institution. We agree on commercial terms for the goods and services we procure from our suppliers, including prices, quantities and payment terms, regardless of whether the supplier elects to participate in the SCF program. Our suppliers’ voluntary participation in the SCF program has no bearing on our payment terms and we have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to participate in the SCF program. Amounts due to our suppliers that elected to participate in the SCF programs are included in Accounts payable on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. At December 31, 2020, Accounts payable included $0.6 billion payable to suppliers who have elected to participate in the SCF program. Amounts settled with third-party financial institutions through the SCF program increased $0.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase for the year ended December 31, 2020 reflects a combination of an extension of payment terms with suppliers and increased utilization of our SCF program. All activity related to amounts due to suppliers that elected to participate in the SCF program is reflected in cash flows from operating activities in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. While access to SCF could decrease if our credit ratings are downgraded, we do not believe that changes in the availability of SCF will have a significant impact on our liquidity. The impact of this program is not material to our overall liquidity. We sell trade receivables to unaffiliated financial institutions without recourse. Transfers of the receivables are accounted for as sales and, accordingly, receivables sold are excluded from Accounts receivable—net on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and are reflected in cash flows from operating activities on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. The difference between the carrying amount of the trade receivables sold and the cash received is recorded in Cost of products and services sold on the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Amounts settled with third-party financial institutions related to accounts receivable factoring were not material for the year ended December 31, 2020, and the impact of this program is not material to our overall liquidity. Finally, we continue to assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit, market position, profit and cash flow contribution in order to identify target investment and acquisition opportunities in order to upgrade our combined portfolio. We identify acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses. We also identify businesses that do not fit into our long-term strategic plan based on their market position, relative profitability or growth potential. These businesses are considered for potential divestiture, restructuring or other repositioning actions, subject to regulatory constraints. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs. Our available cash, committed credit lines and access to the public debt and equity markets provide additional sources of short-term and long-term liquidity to fund current operations, debt maturities, and future investment opportunities. See Note 10 Long-term Debt and Credit Agreements of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of items impacting our liquidity. 35 Honeywell International, Inc. CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS Following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and probable liability payments at December 31, 2020: Total (6)(7) Payments by Period Thereafter 2021 2022 - 2023 2024 - 2025 Long-term debt, including finance leases (1) $ 18,787 $ 2,445 $ 6,102 $ 2,647 $ 7,593 Interest payments on long-term debt, including finance leases 3,674 372 624 507 2,171 Operating lease liabilities 913 204 306 172 231 Purchase obligations (2) 3,595 1,374 1,204 559 458 Estimated environmental liability payments (3) 660 225 213 181 41 Asbestos related liability payments (4) 2,220 300 495 397 1,028 Asbestos insurance recoveries (5) (402) (36) (89) (70) (207) $ 29,447 $ 4,884 $ 8,855 $ 4,393 $ 11,315 (1) Assumes all long-term debt is outstanding until scheduled maturity. (2) Purchase obligations are entered into with various vendors in the normal course of business and are consistent with our expected requirements. This includes leases that were entered into and had not yet commenced as of December 31, 2020. (3) The payment amounts in the table only reflect the environmental liabilities which are probable and reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2020. (4) These amounts are estimates of asbestos related cash payments for NARCO and Bendix based on our asbestos related liabilities which are probable and reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2020. See Asbestos Matters in Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (5) These amounts represent our insurance recoveries that are deemed probable for asbestos related liabilities as of December 31, 2020. See Asbestos Matters in Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (6) The table excludes tax liability payments, including those for unrecognized tax benefits. See Note 5 Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (7) The table excludes expected proceeds from the indemnification and reimbursement agreements entered into with Garrett and Resideo. See Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. ASBESTOS MATTERS Payments, net of insurance recoveries, related to known asbestos matters were $229 million, $163 million and $216 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 and are estimated to be approximately $264 million in 2021. We expect to pay these asbestos matters from operating cash flows. The timing of these payments depends on several factors, including the timing of litigation and settlements of liability claims. Reimbursements from Garrett primarily for asbestos-related liability payments related to the Bendix business in the U.S., as defined in our indemnification and reimbursement agreement with Garrett, were $36 million in 2020. See Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our asbestos matters and Garrett. 36 Honeywell International, Inc. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Accruals during the year for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable were $173 million, $213 million and $395 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. In addition, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately $88 million, $99 million and $95 million relating to compliance with environmental regulations. Payments related to known environmental matters were $216 million, $256 million and $218 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 and are estimated to be approximately $225 million in 2021. We expect to pay these environmental matters from operating cash flows. The timing of these payments depends on several factors, including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, execution timeframe of projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreement with other parties. Reimbursements from Resideo for payments related to environmental matters at certain sites, as defined in the indemnification and reimbursement agreement, were $140 million in 2020 and are expected to be $140 million in 2021. We received $35 million in reimbursement payments from Resideo in January 2021. See Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our environmental matters and the indemnification and reimbursement agreement entered into with Resideo. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Derivative financial instruments are not used for trading or other speculative purposes and we do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments. The following table illustrates the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments based on a hypothetical immediate one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and the potential change in fair value for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments based on a 10% weakening of the U.S. Dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities at December 31, 2020 and 2019. Face or Notional Amount Carrying Value (1) Fair Value (1) Estimated Increase (Decrease) in Fair Value (2) December 31, 2020 Interest Rate Sensitive Instruments Long-term debt (including current maturities) $ 18,787 $ (18,787) $ (20,176) $ (1,063) Interest rate swap agreements 3,950 194 194 (148) Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitive Instruments Foreign currency exchange contracts (3) 16,123 52 52 (334) Cross currency swap agreements 1,200 (50) (50) (125) December 31, 2019 Interest Rate Sensitive Instruments Long-term debt (including current maturities) $ 12,486 $ (12,486) $ (13,578) $ (677) Interest rate swap agreements 3,950 25 25 (72) Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitive Instruments Foreign currency exchange contracts (3) 12,746 270 270 (676) Cross currency swap agreements 1,200 51 51 (115) (1) Asset or (liability). (2) A hypothetical immediate one percentage point decrease in interest rates across all maturities and a potential change in fair value of foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments based on a 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities will result in a change in fair value approximately equal to the inverse of the amount disclosed in the table. (3) Changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts are offset by changes in the fair value, cash flows, or net investments of underlying hedged foreign currency transactions or foreign operations. 37 Honeywell International, Inc. See Note 12 Derivative Instruments and Hedging Transactions to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Many estimates and assumptions involved in the application of accounting principles have a material impact on reported financial condition and operating performance and on the comparability of such reported information over different reporting periods. Critical accounting estimates or assumptions are those where the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. We consider the estimates and assumptions discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Sales Recognition on Long-Term Contracts —We recognize sales for long-term contracts with performance obligations satisfied over time using either an input or output method. We recognize revenue over time as we perform on these contracts based on the continuous transfer of control to the customer. With control transferring over time, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. We generally use the cost-to-cost input method of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as we incur costs. Under the cost-to-cost method, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the proportion of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of our performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion requires judgment. Contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). Cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends and other economic projections. Significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. Revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances. Impacts from changes in estimates of net sales and cost of sales are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis, which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a performance obligation’s percentage of completion. Anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recognized when such losses become evident. We maintain financial controls over the customer qualification, contract pricing and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses. Income Taxes —On a recurring basis, we assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering all available positive and negative evidence, such as past operating results, projections of future taxable income, enacted tax law changes and the feasibility and impact of tax planning initiatives. Our projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume, pricing and costs, as well as the timing and amount of reversals of taxable temporary differences. We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, including resolution of any related appeals and litigation. We assess our income tax positions based upon our evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. For further discussion of additional income tax policies, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 38 Honeywell International, Inc. Reimbursement Receivables —In conjunction with the Garrett and Resideo spin-offs, the Company entered into reimbursement agreements under which Honeywell receives cash payments as reimbursement primarily for asbestos related liability payments related to the Bendix business in the U.S. (Garrett) and for net spending for environmental matters at certain sites as defined in the agreement (Resideo). Accordingly, the Company recorded receivables based on estimates of the underlying reimbursable Honeywell asbestos and environmental spend, and we monitor the recoverability of such receivables, which are subject to the terms of applicable credit agreements and general ability to pay. For Garrett, the Company established an allowance based on the developments associated with Garrett's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. See Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the recognition and measurement of our reimbursement receivables, including the allowance established for Garrett. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Impairment Testing —Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual, or more frequent if necessary, impairment testing. In testing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair value is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts, including strategic and annual operating plans, adjusted for terminal value assumptions. These impairment tests involve the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. To address this uncertainty, we perform sensitivity analyses on key estimates and assumptions. Once the fair value is determined, if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value, it is impaired. Any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and its fair value. Finite-Lived Intangible Assets —The determination of useful lives (for depreciation/amortization purposes) and whether or not intangible assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our finite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a finite-lived intangible asset group may not be fully recoverable. The principal factors in considering when to perform an impairment review are as follows: • Significant under-performance (i.e., declines in sales, earnings or cash flows) of a business or product line in relation to expectations; • Annual operating plans or strategic plan outlook that indicate an unfavorable trend in operating performance of a business or product line; • Significant negative industry or economic trends; or • Significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. Once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary, recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. The impairment is then measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset grouping and its fair value. We endeavor to utilize the best information available to measure fair value, which is usually either market prices (if available), level 1 or level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, or an estimate of the future discounted cash flow, level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The key estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include assumptions as to expected industry and business growth rates, sales volume, selling prices and costs, cash flows, and the discount rate selected. These estimates are subject to changes in the economic environment, including market interest rates and expected volatility. Management believes the estimates of future cash flows and fair values are reasonable; however, changes in estimates due to variance from assumptions could materially affect the valuations. Defined Benefit Pension Plans —We sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. For financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension (income) expense is calculated annually based upon various actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets could materially affect the annual pension (income) expense amount. Annual pension (income) expense is comprised of service and interest cost, assumed return on plan assets, prior service amortization (Pension Ongoing (Income) Expense) and a potential mark-to-market adjustment (MTM Adjustment). 39 Honeywell International, Inc. The key assumptions used in developing our net periodic pension (income) expense for our U.S. plans included the following: 2020 2019 2018 Discount Rate: Projected benefit obligation 3.22 % 4.35 % 3.68 % Service cost 3.33 % 4.47 % 3.77 % Interest cost 2.76 % 3.94 % 3.27 % Assets: Expected rate of return 6.15 % 6.75 % 7.75 % Actual rate of return 13.8 % 21.2 % (1.8) % Actual 10 year average annual compounded rate of return 10.6 % 11.1 % 11.0 % The MTM Adjustment represents the recognition of net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans’ projected benefit obligation (the corridor). Net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the various assumptions used to value our pension plans or when assumptions change. The primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses are changes in the discount rate used to value pension obligations as of the measurement date each year and the difference between expected and actual returns on plan assets. The mark-to-market accounting method results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast MTM Adjustments. MTM Adjustments were $44 million, $123 million and $37 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. We determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets utilizing historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with our expectations of future market conditions and asset mix considerations (see Note 21 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the actual various asset classes and targeted asset allocation percentages for our pension plans). We plan to use an expected rate of return on plan assets of 6.15% for 2021, matching the assumption used for 2020. The discount rate reflects the market rate on December 31 (measurement date) for high-quality fixed-income investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations and is subject to change each year. The discount rate can be volatile from year to year as it is determined based upon prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date. We used a 2.50% discount rate to determine benefit obligations as of December 31, 2020, reflecting a decrease in the market interest rate environment since the prior year-end. In addition to the potential for MTM Adjustments, changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events also affects future pension ongoing (income) expense. The following table highlights the sensitivity of our U.S. pension obligations and ongoing (income) expense to changes in these assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant. These estimates exclude any potential MTM Adjustment: Change in Assumption Impact on 2021 Pension Ongoing Expense Impact on PBO 0.25 percentage point decrease in discount rate Decrease $32 million Increase $520 million 0.25 percentage point increase in discount rate Increase $30 million Decrease $500 million 0.25 percentage point decrease in expected rate of return on assets Increase $50 million — 0.25 percentage point increase in expected rate of return on assets Decrease $50 million — Pension ongoing income for our world-wide pension plans is expected to be approximately $1,046 million in 2021 compared with pension ongoing income of $785 million in 2020. The expected increase in pension income is primarily due to higher expected return on plan assets due to strong asset returns in our U.S. and UK plans in 2020, and lower interest cost from a decrease in discount rates in our U.S. and UK plans. Also, if required, a MTM Adjustment will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021 in accordance with our pension accounting method as previously described. It is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be a MTM Adjustment in 2021, and if one is required, what the magnitude of such adjustment will be. MTM Adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond the control of the Company such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets. 40 Honeywell International, Inc. Asbestos Related Liabilities and Insurance Recoveries —In connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. In assessing the probability of insurance recovery, we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers. While the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. Projecting future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded. Given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections, we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries considering any changes to the projected liability, our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries. Our involvement in asbestos related personal injury actions relates to two predecessor companies. Regarding North American Refractories Company (NARCO) asbestos related claims, we estimate our NARCO asbestos liability for the resolution of asserted Narco-related asbestos claims which qualify for payment under the NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures (Annual Contribution Claims) and for amounts owed pursuant to settlement agreements reached during the pendency of the NARCO bankruptcy proceedings that provide for the right to submit claims to the NARCO Trust subject to qualification under the terms of the settlement agreements and Trust Distribution Procedures (Pre-Established Unliquidated Claims) using average payment values for the relevant historical period. We estimate our NARCO asbestos liability for unasserted claims based on historic and anticipated claims filing experience and payment rates, disease classifications and type of claim, and average payment values by the NARCO Trust for the relevant historical period. Our estimate also includes all years of epidemiological disease projection through 2059. Regarding Bendix Friction Materials (Bendix) asbestos related claims, we accrued for the estimated value of pending claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. We also accrued for the estimated value of future claims related to Bendix over the full term of epidemiological disease projection through 2059 based on historic and anticipated claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and average resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. We update our assumptions on average payment values and average resolution values in the fourth quarter of each year. See Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of management’s judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of our asbestos related liabilities and related insurance recoveries. Contingent Liabilities —We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and claims (some of which involve substantial dollar amounts) that arise out of the conduct of our global business operations or those of previously owned entities, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, legal and environmental, health and safety matters. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on a thorough analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters, the outcome of negotiations, the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claims, and the impact of evidentiary requirements. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to new developments (including new discovery of facts, changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases through the judicial system), changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy. See Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of management’s judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of our environmental and asbestos liabilities which represent our most significant contingencies.

MARKET FOR REGISTRANT'S COMMON EQUITY, RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS AND ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “HON”. Dividend information for Honeywell’s common stock is included in Note 26 Unaudited Quarterly Financial Information of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We increased our quarterly dividend rate by 3% to $0.93 per share of common stock effective with the fourth quarter 2020 dividend. We intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends in 2021. The number of record holders of our common stock at December 31, 2020 was 42,205. Information regarding securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans is included the section titled Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters under the caption “Equity Compensation Plans.” We purchased 7,619,919 shares of our common stock, par value $1 per share, in the quarter ending December 31, 2020. On April 29, 2019, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to a total of $10 billion of Honeywell common stock, which included amounts remaining under, and replaced, the previously approved share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2020, $3.3 billion remained available for additional share repurchases. We expect to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to generally offset the dilutive impact of employee stock-based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. Additionally, we seek to reduce share count via share repurchases as and when attractive opportunities arise. The amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and the level of our operating, financing and other investing activities. The following table summarizes our purchases of Honeywell's common stock for the three months ended December 31, 2020: Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet be Purchased Under Plans or Programs (Dollars in millions) October 1 - 31, 2020 — $ — — $ 4,841 November 1 - 30, 2020 2,430,000 $ 198.09 2,430,000 $ 4,360 December 1 - 31, 2020 5,189,919 $ 208.96 5,189,919 $ 3,275 44 Honeywell International, Inc. PERFORMANCE GRAPH The following graph compares the five-year cumulative total return on our common stock to the total returns on the Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 500 Stock Index and a composite of S&P’s Industrial Conglomerates and Aerospace and Defense indices, on a 55%/45% weighted basis (the Composite Index). The weighting of the components of the Composite Index are based on our segments’ relative contribution to total segment profit. The selection of the Industrial Conglomerates component of the Composite Index reflects the diverse and distinct range of non-aerospace businesses conducted by Honeywell. The annual changes for the five-year period shown in the graph are based on the assumption that $100 was invested in Honeywell stock and each index on December 31, 2015 and that all dividends were reinvested.

HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) NOTE 1. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES The financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The following is a description of Honeywell’s significant accounting policies. PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Honeywell International Inc. and all of its subsidiaries and entities in which a controlling interest is maintained. Our consolidation policy requires equity investments that we exercise significant influence over but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investee’s activities to be accounted for using the equity method. Investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which we do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. RECLASSIFICATIONS Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS The Company considers the applicability and impact of all Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on our consolidated statement of operations, balance sheet and cash flows (Consolidated Financial Statements). In December 2019, the FASB issued an ASU to simplify the accounting for income taxes. The standard’s amendments include changes in various subtopics of accounting for income taxes including, but not limited to, accounting for “hybrid” tax regimes, tax basis step-up in goodwill obtained in a transaction that is not a business combination, intraperiod tax allocation exception to incremental approach, ownership changes in investments, interim-period accounting for enacted changes in tax law, and year-to-date loss limitation in interim-period tax accounting. Effective January 1, 2021, the Company adopted this standard. The adoption of this standard does not have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. In March 2020, the FASB issued guidance that provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounted principles to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by the transition away from reference rates expected to be discontinued to alternative reference rates. The guidance was effective upon issuance and may be applied prospectively to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into on or before December 31, 2022. The Company is currently evaluating the impacts of this guidance on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Research and development costs for projects are expensed as incurred, unless these costs relate to contracts with customers where we receive reimbursements. Amounts expensed as incurred for Company-sponsored research and development projects are included in Cost of products and services sold and were $ 1,334 million, $ 1,556 million and $ 1,809 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Costs related to contracts with customers for customer-sponsored research and development projects are included as a contract cost and included in Cost of products and services sold when revenue from such contracts is recognized, consistent with our sales recognition policies. This revenue was $ 1,200 million, $ 1,079 million and $ 1,069 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. 51 Honeywell International, Inc. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly liquid investments having an original maturity of three months or less. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including any asset retirement obligations, less accumulated depreciation. For financial reporting, the straight-line method of depreciation is used over the estimated useful lives of 10 to 50 years for buildings and improvements and 2 to 16 years for machinery and equipment. Recognition of the fair value of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets is required when there is a legal obligation to incur such costs. Upon initial recognition of a liability, the cost is capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the corresponding asset’s useful life. GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment testing annually as of March 31, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. This testing compares carrying values to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of March 31, 2020 and determined that there was no impairment as of that date. In addition, due to the economic impact of COVID-19, we updated our assessment as of June 30, 2020, and determined there was no impairment. We are not aware of any additional triggering events. FINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS Other intangible assets with determinable lives consist of customer lists, technology, patents and trademarks and other intangibles and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 2 to 24 years. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside the United States with a functional currency other than U.S. Dollars are translated into U.S. Dollars using year-end exchange rates. Sales, costs and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the year. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments, inventories and property, plant and equipment, including related expenses, are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect on the date the assets were acquired, while monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at year-end exchange rates. Remeasurement adjustments for these subsidiaries are included in earnings. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS All derivative financial instruments are recorded on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. For derivatives designated as hedges of the fair value of assets or liabilities, the changes in fair values of both the derivatives and the hedged items are recorded in current earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the changes in fair value of the derivatives are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged items impact earnings. Derivative financial instruments designated as hedges must be designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception of the contract. Changes in fair value of the derivative contract must be highly correlated with changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item at inception and over the life of the hedge contract. Cash flows of such derivative financial instruments are classified consistent with the underlying hedged item. We elected to exclude the time value of the derivatives (i.e., the forward points) from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize the initial value of the excluded component in earnings using the amortization approach. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a net investment hedge, the gain or loss is reported as a component of Other comprehensive income (loss) and recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The gain or loss will be subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. 52 Honeywell International, Inc. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) LEASES At the inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. The assessment is based on (1) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (2) whether the Company obtains the right to substantially all the economic benefit from the use of the asset throughout the period, and (3) whether the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. All significant lease arrangements are generally recognized at lease commencement. Operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement. An ROU asset and corresponding lease liability are not recorded for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less (short-term leases), and we recognize lease expense for these leases as incurred over the lease term. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset during the reasonably certain lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Lease payments may be fixed or variable, however, only fixed payments or in-substance fixed payments are included in determining the lease liability. Variable lease payments are recognized in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for those payments are incurred. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments related to initial direct cost and prepayments and excludes lease incentives. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. The Company primarily uses our incremental borrowing rate, which is based on the information available at the lease commencement date, in determining the present value of the lease payments. In determining the borrowing rate, we consider the lease term, secured incremental borrowing rate, and for leases denominated in a currency different than U.S. dollar, the collateralized borrowing rate in the foreign currency using the U.S. dollar and foreign currency swap spread, when availab le. PENSION BENEFITS The Company presents net periodic pensions costs by disaggregating the service cost component of such costs and reports those costs in the same line item or items in the Consolidated Statement of Operations as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. The other non-service components of such costs are required to be presented separately from the service cost component. The Company records the service cost component of Pension ongoing (income) expense in Costs of products and services sold and Selling, general and administrative expenses. The remaining components of costs within Pension ongoing (income) expense, primarily interest costs and assumed return on plan assets, are recorded in Other (income) expense. We recognize net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plan's projected benefit obligation (the corridor) annually in the fourth quarter each year (MTM Adjustment). The MTM Adjustment is also reported in Other (income) expense. 53 Honeywell International, Inc. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) SALES RECOGNITION Product and service sales are recognized when or as the Company transfers control of the promised products or services to its customers. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. Service sales, principally representing repair, maintenance and engineering activities, are recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered. Sales under long-term contracts with performance obligations satisfied over time are recognized using either an input or output method. We recognize revenue over time as we perform on these contracts because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer. With control transferring over time, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. We generally use the cost-to-cost input method of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as we incur costs. Under the cost-to-cost method, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the proportion of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. We review our cost estimates on significant contracts on a periodic basis, or when circumstances change and warrant a modification to a previous estimate. Cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends and other economic projections. Significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. Provisions for anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recorded in full when such losses become evident, to the extent required. The customer funding for costs incurred for nonrecurring engineering and development activities of our products under agreements with commercial customers is deferred and subsequently recognized as revenue as products are delivered to the customers. Additionally, expenses incurred, up to the customer agreed funded amount, are deferred as an asset and recognized as cost of sales when products are delivered to the customer. The deferred customer funding and costs result in recognition of deferred costs (asset) and deferred revenue (liability) on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Capitalized contract fulfillment costs were approximately $ 1.3 billion and $ 1 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. The amounts recognized as Cost of products and services sold were approximately $ 0.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Revenues for our mechanical service programs are recognized as performance obligations that are satisfied over time, with recognition reflecting a series of distinct services using the output method. The terms of a contract or the historical business practice can give rise to variable consideration due to, but not limited to, cash-based incentives, rebates, performance awards, or credits. We estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount we will receive from customers. We include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized for such transaction will not occur, or when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Our estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS The principal awards issued under our stock-based compensation plans, which are described in Note 16 Stock-Based Compensation Plans, are non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units. The cost for such awards is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods (generally the vesting period of the equity award) and is included in Selling, general and administrative expenses. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant to recognize expense for those awards that are expected to vest and are based on our historical forfeiture rates. 54 Honeywell International, Inc. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) INCOME TAXES Significant judgment is required in evaluating tax positions. We establish reserves for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum recognition threshold. The approach for evaluating certain and uncertain tax positions is defined by the authoritative guidance which determines when a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are examined by various federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a change in estimate become known. During 2020, the Company revised the disclosure of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities in Note 5 Income Taxes as of December 31, 2019, to present separately the deferred tax liability for Right-of-use assets of $ 159 million and the deferred tax asset for Lease liabilities of $ 167 million, which were previously reported net within the deferred tax liability for Property, plant and equipment. This had no other impact to our Consolidated Financial Statements. For additional information, see Note 5 Income Taxes. EARNINGS PER SHARE Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and all dilutive potential common shares outstanding. ENVIRONMENTAL The Company accrues costs related to environmental matters when it is probable that it has incurred a liability related to a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated. For additional information, see Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies. ASBESTOS RELATED LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE RECOVERIES The Company recognizes a liability for any asbestos related contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. In connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. For additional information, see Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies. REIMBURSEMENT RECEIVABLES In conjunction with the Garrett and Resideo spin-offs, the Company entered into reimbursement agreements under which Honeywell receives cash payments as reimbursement primarily for asbestos related liability payments related to the Bendix business in the U.S. (Garrett) and for net spending for environmental matters at certain sites as defined in the agreement (Resideo). Accordingly, the Company recorded receivables based on estimates of the underlying reimbursable Honeywell asbestos and environmental spend, and we monitor the recoverability of such receivables, which are subject to the terms of applicable credit agreements and general ability to pay. For Garrett, the Company established an allowance based on the developments associated with Garrett's Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing. See Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies for a discussion of the recognition and measurement of our reimbursement receivables, including the allowance established for Garrett. 55 Honeywell International, Inc. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) NOTE 2. ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES During 2020, the Company acquired businesses for an aggregate cost (net of cash and debt assumed) of approximately $ 261 million, which included the October 2020 acquisition of Rocky Research and the December 2020 acquisition of Sine Group. Rocky Research is a technology leader specializing in thermal, energy and power management solutions and is included within our Aerospace segment. Sine Group offers a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) that handles visitor management, workplace and supply chain solutions and is included in the Honeywell Building Technologies segment. The preliminary determination of the assets and liabilities acquired with Rocky Research and Sine Group is included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2020, including $ 167 million allocated to goodwill, which is non-deductible for tax purposes. There were no significant divestitures during 2020. On December 22, 2020, the Company agreed to acquire 100% of the outstanding stock of Sparta Systems from New Mountain Capital in an all-cash transaction for $ 1.3 billion. Sparta Systems is a leading provider of enterprise quality management software for the life sciences industry and is expected to further strengthen the Company's leadership in industrial automation, digital transformation solutions, and enterprise performance management software. The transaction is subject to regulatory review and approval and customary closing conditions. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2021 and the business will be reported within the Performance Materials and Technologies segment. During 2019, there were no significant acquisitions or divestitures individually or in the aggregate. During 2018, the Company acquired businesses for an aggregate cost (net of cash and debt assumed) of approximately $ 535 million, mainly due to the November 2018 acquisition of Transnorm , a global leader in high-performance conveyor and warehouse solutions, including approximately $ 380 million allocated to goodwill. Transnorm is part of Safety and Productivity Solutions. The goodwill is non-deductible for tax purposes. On October 1, 2018, the Company completed the tax-free spin-off to Honeywell shareowners of its Transportation Systems business, part of Aerospace, into a standalone publicly-traded company, Garrett. On October 29, 2018, the Company completed the tax-free spin-off to Honeywell shareowners of its Homes and Global Distribution business, part of Home and Building Technologies (renamed Honeywell Building Technologies following the spin-off), into a standalone publicly-traded company, Resideo. The assets of approximately $ 5.5 billion, including approximately $ 2.8 billion of goodwill and net of recorded receivables, and liabilities of approximately $ 7.2 billion, associated with the spin-off entities were removed through Retained Earnings from the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the effective date of the spin-off. The results of operations and cash flows are included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows through the effective date of the spin-off. The Income before taxes attributable to the spin-off businesses were $ 0.4 billion for 2018. Honeywell shareowners of record as of the close of business on October 16, 2018 received one share of Resideo common stock for every 6 shares of Honeywell common stock. Immediately prior to the effective date of the spin-off, Resideo incurred debt of $ 1.2 billion to make a cash distribution to the Company. Honeywell shareowners of record as of the close of business on September 18, 2018 received one share of Garrett common stock for every 10 shares of Honeywell common stock. Immediately prior to the effective date of the spin-off, Garrett incurred debt of $ 1.6 billion to make a cash distribution to the Company. In 2018, in connection with the spin-off, the Company entered into certain agreements with Resideo and Garrett to effect our legal and structural separation, including transition services agreements to provide certain administrative and other services for a limited time, and tax matters and indemnification and reimbursement agreements. For additional information, see Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies. 56 Honeywell International, Inc. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

For a summary by disaggregated product and services sales for each segment, refer to Note 23 Segment Financial Data. The Company recognizes revenue arising from performance obligations outlined in contracts with its customers that are satisfied at a point in time and over time. The disaggregation of our revenue based off timing of recognition is as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Products, transferred point in time 61 % 61 % 67 % Products, transferred over time 15 14 12 Net product sales 76 75 79 Services, transferred point in time 8 9 7 Services, transferred over time 16 16 14 Net service sales 24 25 21 Net sales 100 % 100 % 100 % 58 Honeywell International, Inc. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) CONTRACT BALANCES The Company records progress on satisfying performance obligations under contracts with customers and the related billings and cash collections are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in Accounts receivable—net and Other assets (unbilled receivables (contract assets) and billed receivables) and Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities (customer advances and deposits (contract liabilities)). Unbilled receivables (contract assets) arise when the timing of cash collected from customers differs from the timing of revenue recognition, such as when contract provisions require specific milestones to be met before a customer can be billed. Those assets are recognized when the revenue associated with the contract is recognized prior to billing and derecognized when billed in accordance with the terms of the contract. Contract liabilities are recorded when customers remit contractual cash payments in advance of us satisfying performance obligations under contractual arrangements, including those with performance obligations to be satisfied over a period of time. Contract liabilities are derecognized when revenue is recorded, either when a milestone is met triggering the contractual right to bill or when the performance obligation is satisfied. Contract balances are classified as assets or liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. The following table summarizes the Company's contract assets and liabilities balances: 2020 2019 Contract assets—January 1 $ 1,602 $ 1,548 Contract assets—December 31 1,618 1,602 Change in contract assets—increase (decrease) $ 16 $ 54 Contract liabilities—January 1 $ ( 3,501 ) $ ( 3,378 ) Contract liabilities—December 31 ( 4,033 ) ( 3,501 ) Change in contract liabilities—(increase) decrease $ ( 532 ) $ ( 123 ) Net change $ ( 516 ) $ ( 69 ) The net change in 2020 and 2019 was primarily driven by the receipt of advance payments from customers exceeding recognition of revenue as performance obligations were satisfied prior to billing. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized revenue of $ 1,709 million and $ 1,543 million that was previously included in the beginning balance of contract liabilities. When contracts are modified to account for changes in contract specifications and requirements, the Company considers whether the modification either creates new or changes the existing enforceable rights and obligations. Contract modifications for goods or services and not distinct from the existing contract, due to the significant integration with the original good or service provided, are accounted for as if they were part of that existing contract. The effect of a contract modification on the transaction price and our measure of progress for the performance obligation to which it relates, is recognized as an adjustment to revenue (either as an increase in or a reduction of revenue) on a cumulative catch-up basis. When the modifications include additional performance obligations that are distinct and at relative stand-alone selling price, they are accounted for as a new contract and performance obligation, which are recognized prospectively. 59 Honeywell International, Inc. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is defined as the unit of account. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. When our contracts with customers require highly complex integration or manufacturing services that are not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts and, therefore, not distinct, then the entire contract is accounted for as a single performance obligation. In situations when our contract includes distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer over time, they are recognized as a series of distinct goods or services. For any contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated relative standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. For product sales, each product sold to a customer typically represents a distinct performance obligation. In such cases, the observable standalone sales are used to determine the stand alone selling price. Performance obligations are satisfied as of a point in time or over time. Performance obligations are supported by contracts with customers, providing a framework for the nature of the distinct goods, services or bundle of goods and services. The timing of satisfying the performance obligation is typically indicated by the terms of the contract. The following table outlines the Company's remaining performance obligations disaggregated by segment: December 31, 2020 Aerospace $ 9,493 Honeywell Building Technologies 5,924 Performance Materials and Technologies 6,704 Safety and Productivity Solutions 4,255 $ 26,376 Performance obligations recognized as of December 31, 2020 will be satisfied over the course of future periods. Our disclosure of the timing for satisfying the performance obligation is based on the requirements of contracts with customers. However, from time to time, these contracts may be subject to modifications, impacting the timing of satisfying the performance obligations. Performance obligations expected to be satisfied within one year and greater than one year are 55 % and 45 %, respectively. The timing of satisfaction of the Company's performance obligations does not significantly vary from the typical timing of payment. Typical payment terms of our fixed-price over time contracts include progress payments based on specified events or milestones, or based on project progress. For some contracts we may be entitled to receive an advance payment. The Company has applied the practical expedient for certain revenue streams to exclude the value of remaining performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected term of one year or less or (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue in proportion to the amount we have the right to invoice for services performed. 60 Honeywell International, Inc.

The workforce reductions primarily related to the Company aligning its cost structure with the slowdown in demand for many of its products and services due to the global recession, and with our productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives and to site consolidations and hub strategies. The repositioning charge included exit costs of $ 69 million primarily related to current period exit costs incurred for previously approved repositioning projects. Also, $ 47 million of previously established reserves, primarily for severance, were returned to income mainly as a result of higher attrition than anticipated in prior severance actions resulting in lower payments. In 2019, the Company recognized repositioning charges totaling $ 438 million, including severance costs of $ 260 million related to workforce reductions of 5,336 manufacturing and administrative positions across our segments. The workforce reductions related to our productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives and to site transitions, mainly in Honeywell Building Technologies, as we transition manufacturing to more cost-effective 61 Honeywell International, Inc. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) locations. The repositioning charge included asset impairments of $ 95 million largely related to a write down in connection with assets held for sale. The repositioning charge included exit costs of $ 83 million primarily related to current period exit costs incurred for previously approved repositioning projects, termination fees associated with the early cancellation of supply agreements for certain raw materials in Performance Materials and Technologies and Honeywell Building Technologies and for closure obligations associated with site transitions. In 2018, the Company recognized repositioning charges totaling $ 530 million, including severance costs of $ 289 million related to workforce reductions of 6,486 manufacturing and administrative positions across our segments. The workforce reductions were primarily related to planned site closures, mainly in Safety and Productivity Solutions, Performance Materials and Technologies and Honeywell Building Technologies, as we transition manufacturing sites to more cost-effective locations. The workforce reductions were also related to our productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives. The repositioning charge included asset impairments of $ 162 million mainly related to manufacturing plant and equipment associated with planned site closures. Asset impairments also included the write-down of a legacy property in Corporate in connection with its planned disposition and the write-off of certain capitalized assets in Corporate. The repositioning charge included exit costs of $ 79 million primarily related to a termination fee associated with the early cancellation of a supply agreement for certain raw materials in Performance Materials and Technologies and for closure obligations associated with planned site closures. The following table summarizes the status of the Company's total repositioning reserves: Severance Costs Asset Impairments Exit Costs Total Balance at December 31, 2017 $ 442 $ — $ 71 $ 513 Charges 289 162 79 530 Usage—cash ( 218 ) — ( 67 ) ( 285 ) Usage—noncash — ( 163 ) — ( 163 ) Divestitures ( 11 ) — ( 3 ) ( 14 ) Adjustments ( 8 ) 1 ( 3 ) ( 10 ) Foreign currency translation ( 5 ) — — ( 5 ) Balance at December 31, 2018 489 — 77 566 Charges 260 95 83 438 Usage—cash ( 186 ) — ( 63 ) ( 249 ) Usage—noncash — ( 100 ) — ( 100 ) Divestitures — — — — Adjustments ( 8 ) 5 ( 2 ) ( 5 ) Foreign currency translation — — 1 1 Balance at December 31, 2019 555 — 96 651 Charges 475 21 69 565 Usage—cash ( 474 ) — ( 90 ) ( 564 ) Usage—noncash — ( 21 ) — ( 21 ) Divestitures — — — — Adjustments ( 44 ) — ( 3 ) ( 47 ) Foreign currency translation 15 — 2 17 Balance at December 31, 2020 $ 527 $ — $ 74 $ 601 Certain repositioning projects will recognize exit costs in future periods when the actual liability is incurred. Such exit costs incurred in 2020, 2019 and 2018 were not significant. In 2018, the other charge of $ 63 million mainly relates to reserves taken due to the required wind-down of the Company's activities in Iran and the evaluation of potential resolution of a certain legal matter. 62 Honeywell International, Inc.

HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) The effective tax rate increased by 1.5 percentage points in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarily attributable to accrued withholding taxes related to unremitted foreign earnings and non-cash charges related to the reduction of the aggregate carrying value of certain receivables with no corresponding tax benefit, offset by the favorable resolution of a foreign tax matter related to the previously completed spin-off transactions, tax impact of restructuring, tax law changes in India, and the resolution of certain U.S. tax matters. The Company’s non-U.S. effective tax rate was 11.9 %, a decrease of approximately 14.2 percentage points compared to 2019. The decrease in the foreign effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the favorable resolution of a foreign tax matter related to the previously completed spin-off transactions, tax impact of restructuring, and tax law changes in India offset by accrued withholding taxes related to unremitted foreign earnings. The effective tax rate increased by 8.8 percentage points in 2019 compared to 2018. The increase was primarily attributable to a lower income tax benefit resulting from revised guidance related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and internal restructuring initiatives that resulted in a $ 281 million reduction of accrued withholding taxes related to unremitted foreign earnings when compared to the prior year. The Company’s non-U.S. effective tax rate was 26.1 %, an increase of approximately 22.0 percentage points compared to 2018. The increase in the foreign effective tax rate was primarily attributable to a lower income tax benefit related to the Company’s internal restructuring initiatives when compared to the prior year. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS (LIABILITIES) The tax effects of temporary differences and tax carryforwards which give rise to future income tax benefits and payables are as follows: Deferred tax assets: December 31, 2020 2019 Postretirement benefits other than pensions $ 85 $ 111 Asbestos and environmental 508 531 Employee compensation and benefits 180 205 Lease liabilities 197 167 Other accruals and reserves 110 279 Net operating and capital losses 779 652 Tax credit carryforwards 219 246 Gross deferred tax assets 2,078 2,191 Valuation allowance ( 766 ) ( 656 ) Total deferred tax assets $ 1,312 $ 1,535 Deferred tax liabilities: Pension $ ( 548 ) $ ( 469 ) Property, plant and equipment ( 437 ) ( 477 ) Right-of-use asset ( 184 ) ( 159 ) Intangibles ( 898 ) ( 1,296 ) Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries ( 398 ) ( 419 ) Other asset basis differences ( 169 ) ( 136 ) Other ( 31 ) ( 163 ) Total deferred tax liabilities ( 2,665 ) ( 3,119 ) Net deferred tax liability $ ( 1,353 ) $ ( 1,584 ) 64 Honeywell International, Inc. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) The Company's gross deferred tax assets include $ 872 million related to non-U.S. operations comprised principally of net operating losses, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards (mainly in Canada, France, Germany, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom) and deductible temporary differences. We maintain a valuation allowance of $ 758 million against a portion of the non-U.S. gross deferred tax assets. The change in the valuation allowance resulted in an increase of $ 105 million, a decrease of $ 23 million and an increase of $ 57 million to income tax expense in 2020, 2019 and 2018. In the event we determine that we will not be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future, we will reduce such amounts through an increase to income tax expense in the period such determination is made. Conversely, if we determine that we will be able to realize net deferred tax assets in excess of the carrying amounts, we will decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a reduction to income tax expense in the period that such determination is made. As of December 31, 2020, the Company recorded a $ 398 million deferred tax liability on all our unremitted foreign earnings based on estimated earnings and profits of approximately $ 22.4 billion as of the balance sheet date. As of December 31, 2020, the Company's net operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards were as follows: Jurisdiction Expiration Period Net Operating and Capital Loss Carryforwards Tax Credit Carryforwards U.S. Federal 2040 $ 24 $ 92 U.S. State 2040 382 21 Non-U.S. 2040 314 111 Non-U.S. Indefinite 2,532 — $ 3,252 $ 224 Many jurisdictions impose limitations on the timing and utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. In those instances, whereby there is an expected permanent limitation on the utilization of the net operating loss or tax credit carryforward, the deferred tax asset and amount of the carryforward have been reduced.

Based on the outcome of these examinations, or as a result of the expiration of statute of limitations for specific jurisdictions, it is reasonably possible that certain unrecognized tax benefits for tax positions taken on previously filed tax returns will materially change from those recorded as liabilities in our financial statements. In addition, the outcome of these examinations may impact the valuation of certain deferred tax assets (such as net operating losses) in future periods. Unrecognized tax benefits for examinations in progress were $ 556 million, $ 413 million and $ 304 million, as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Estimated interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes are classified as a component of Tax expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and totaled $ 80 million, $ 73 million and $ 45 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Accrued interest and penalties were $ 507 million, $ 487 million and $ 426 million, as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. NOTE 6.

The Company believes the FIFO method is preferable and better reflects the current value of inventory reported in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle was $ 7 million and was recorded as a reduction to Cost of products sold for the year ended December 31, 2020. The inventories subject to this change totaled approximately 6 % of consolidated inventories at the time of this change. This change was not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements, and therefore prior periods were not adjusted retrospectively. Inventories valued at LIFO amounted to $ 292 million at December 31, 2019. Had such LIFO inventories been valued at current costs, the carrying values would have been approximately $ 45 million higher at December 31, 2019. There are no remaining inventories valued at LIFO.

NOTE 11. LEASES A significant portion of the Company's operating and finance lease portfolio includes corporate offices, research and development facilities, manufacturing sites, information technology equipment, and automobiles. The majority of our leases have remaining lease terms of 1 year to 20 years, some of which include options to extend the leases for 5 years or more. Operating lease ROU assets are included in Other assets. The current portion of operating lease liabilities are included in Accrued liabilities, and the non-current portion of operating lease liabilities are included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Finance lease ROU assets are included in Property, plant and equipment—net. The current portion of finance lease liabilities are included in Current maturities of long-term debt, and the non-current portion of finance lease liabilities are included in Long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. A portion of the Company's real estate leases is generally subject to annual changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The changes to the CPI are treated as variable lease payments and recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments was incurred.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING TRANSACTIONS DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES The Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its risks related to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Derivative financial instruments are not used for trading or other speculative purposes. To qualify as a hedge, derivative financial instruments must be evaluated for hedge effectiveness at the inception of the contract and designated as a hedge. Changes in fair value of the derivative contract must be highly correlated with changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item at inception and over the life of the hedge contract. 72 Honeywell International, Inc. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT The Company operates a global business in a wide variety of foreign currencies. Our exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries, foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and transactions arising from international trade. The Company's objective is to preserve the U.S. Dollar value of foreign currency denominated cash flows and earnings. The Company monitors its collective foreign currency exposure and enters into foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts (foreign currency exchange contracts) with third parties, when necessary, to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company has monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Prior to conversion into U.S. dollars, these assets and liabilities are remeasured at spot exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. The effects of changes in spot rates are recognized in earnings and included in Other (income) expense. We use foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge our foreign currency exposure. These contracts are marked-to-market with the resulting gains and losses recognized in earnings offsetting the gains and losses on the non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities being hedged. The Company uses foreign currency contracts to hedge forecasted sales and purchases, which are denominated in non-functional currencies. Changes in the forecasted non-functional currency cash flows due to movements in exchange rates are substantially offset by changes in the fair value of these foreign currency exchange contracts designated as hedges. Market value gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in earnings when the hedged transaction is recognized. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company held contracts with notional amounts of $ 16,123 million and $ 12,746 million to exchange foreign currencies, principally the U.S. Dollar, Euro, Canadian Dollar, British Pound, Swiss Franc, Mexican Peso, Chinese Renminbi, Indian Rupee, and Malaysian Ringgit. The Company also designates certain foreign currency debt and derivative contracts as hedges against portions of its net investment in foreign operations. Gains or losses of the foreign currency debt and derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges are recorded in the same manner as foreign currency translation adjustments. INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose the Company to market risk related to changes in interest rates. The Company uses a combination of financial instruments, including long-term, medium-term and short-term financing, variable-rate commercial paper, and interest rate swaps to convert the interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. CREDIT RISK MANAGEMENT The Company continues to monitor the creditworthiness of its counterparties to mitigate the risk of nonperformance. Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose the Company to counterparty credit risk. In addition, the Company grants credit terms to its customers in the normal course of business. The terms and conditions of our credit sales are designed to mitigate or eliminate concentrations of credit risk with any single customer. Our sales are not materially dependent on a single customer or a small group of customers. 73 Honeywell International, Inc. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

As of December 31, 2020, cash collateral received that has not been offset against our derivatives of $ 34 million was recorded in Accrued liabilities and Other assets. In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of the Company's foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges. The carrying value of those debt instruments designated as net investment hedges, which includes the adjustment for the foreign currency transaction gain or loss on those instruments, was $ 4,414 million and $ 6,882 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Interest rate swap agreements are designated as hedge relationships with gains or losses on the derivative recognized in Interest and other financial charges offsetting the gains and losses on the underlying debt being hedged. Gains and losses on interest rate swap agreements recognized in earnings were $ 169 million of income, $ 70 million of income and $ 37 million of expense for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Gains and losses are fully offset by losses and gains on the underlying debt being hedged.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS The accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy. • Level 1 - Inputs are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. • Level 2 - Inputs are based on observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical or similar assets and liabilities. • Level 3 - One or more inputs are unobservable and significant. Financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The following table sets forth the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2020 and 2019: December 31, 2020 2019 Assets: Foreign currency exchange contracts $ 202 $ 291 Available for sale investments 1,118 1,523 Interest rate swap agreements 194 38 Cross currency swap agreements — 51 Liabilities: Foreign currency exchange contracts $ 150 $ 21 Interest rate swap agreements — 13 Cross currency swap agreements 50 — The foreign currency exchange contracts, interest rate swap agreements, and cross currency swap agreements are valued using broker quotations, or market transactions in either the listed or over-the-counter markets. As such, these derivative instruments are classified within level 2. The Company also holds investments in commercial paper, certificates of deposits, and time deposits that are designated as available for sale and are valued using published prices based on observable market data. As such, these investments are classified within level 2. The Company also holds available for sale investments in U.S. government and corporate debt securities valued utilizing published prices based on quoted market pricing, which are classified within level 1. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts and notes receivables, payables, commercial paper and short-term borrowings contained in the Consolidated Balance Sheet approximates fair value.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS The 2016 Stock Incentive Plan of Honeywell International Inc. and its Affiliates (2016 Plan) and 2016 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors of Honeywell International Inc. (2016 Directors Plan) were both approved by the shareowners at the Annual Meeting of Shareowners effective on April 25, 2016. At December 31, 2020, there were 34,104,522 , and 832,309 shares of Honeywell common stock available for future grants under terms of the 2016 Plan and 2016 Directors Plan, respectively. STOCK OPTIONS The exercise price, term and other conditions applicable to each option granted under the Company's stock plans are generally determined by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors. The exercise price of stock options is set on the grant date and may not be less than the fair market value per share of our stock on that date. The fair value is recognized as an expense over the employee’s requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the award). Options generally vest over a four -year period and expire after ten years. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on our common stock and historical volatility of our common stock. We used a Monte Carlo simulation model to derive an expected term which represents an estimate of the time options are expected to remain outstanding. Such model uses historical data to estimate option exercise activity and post-vest termination behavior. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The Company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements relating to the protection of the environment. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of hazardous substances are in accordance with environmental and safety laws and regulations. However, mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we, like other companies engaged in similar businesses, have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. With respect to environmental matters involving site contamination, the Company continually conducts studies, individually or jointly with other potentially responsible parties, to determine the feasibility of various remedial techniques. It is our policy to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters when remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work. The recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical, regulatory or legal information becomes available. Given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws, regulations, enforcement policies, the impact of other potentially responsible parties, technology and information related to individual sites, we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of our recorded liabilities. We expect to fund expenditures for these matters from operating cash flow. The timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of factors, including the timing of remedial investigations and feasibility studies, the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties. 85 Honeywell International, Inc. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) The following table summarizes information concerning the Company's recorded liabilities for environmental costs: Years Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Beginning of year $ 709 $ 755 $ 595 Accruals for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable 173 213 395 Environmental liability payments ( 216 ) ( 256 ) ( 218 ) Other ( 6 ) ( 3 ) ( 17 ) End of year $ 660 $ 709 $ 755 Environmental liabilities are included in the following balance sheet accounts: December 31, 2020 2019 Accrued liabilities $ 225 $ 222 Other liabilities 435 487 $ 660 $ 709 The Company does not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of environmental liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies, litigation or settlements, and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined, although they could be material to our Consolidated Statement of Operations and operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid. However, considering our past experience and existing reserves, the Company does not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on its Consolidated Balance Sheet. In conjunction with the Resideo spin-off, the Company entered into an indemnification and reimbursement agreement with a Resideo subsidiary, pursuant to which Resideo’s subsidiary has an ongoing obligation to make cash payments to Honeywell in amounts equal to 90% of Honeywell’s annual net spending for environmental matters at certain sites as defined in the agreement. The amount payable to Honeywell in any given year is subject to a cap of $ 140 million, and the obligation will continue until the earlier of December 31, 2043, or December 31 of the third consecutive year during which the annual payment obligation is less than $ 25 million. Reimbursements associated with this agreement are collected from Resideo quarterly and were $ 140 million in both 2020 and 2019 and offset operating cash outflows incurred by the Company. On July 28, 2020, the Company and Resideo agreed to a second amendment of the indemnification and reimbursement agreement to extend the payment due date to October 30, 2020 for the reimbursement amount of $ 35 million (originally due on April 30, 2020). The Company had previously agreed to extend the payment date for such amount to July 30, 2020. On October 30, 2020, Resideo paid Honeywell the regularly scheduled reimbursement amount of $ 35 million due on that date as well as the deferred reimbursement amount of $ 35 million. As the Company incurs costs for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable related to the sites covered by the indemnification and reimbursement agreement, a corresponding receivable from Resideo for 90% of such costs is also recorded. This receivable amount recorded in 2020 and 2019 was $ 146 million and $ 109 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, Other Current Assets and Other Assets included $ 140 million and $ 451 million, respectively, for the short-term and long-term portion of the receivable amount due from Resideo under the indemnification and reimbursement agreement. As of December 31, 2019, Other Current Assets and Other Assets included $ 140 million and $ 445 million, respectively, for the short-term and long-term portion of the receivable amount due from Resideo under the indemnification and reimbursement agreement. 86 Honeywell International, Inc.

HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) NARCO Products – NARCO manufactured high-grade, heat-resistant, refractory products for various industries. Honeywell’s predecessor, Allied Corporation, owned NARCO from 1979 to 1986. Allied Corporation sold the NARCO business in 1986 and entered into a cross-indemnity agreement which included an obligation to indemnify the purchaser for asbestos claims. Such claims arise primarily from alleged occupational exposure to asbestos-containing refractory brick and mortar for high-temperature applications. NARCO ceased manufacturing these products in 1980 and ultimately filed for bankruptcy in January 2002, at which point in time all then current and future NARCO asbestos claims were stayed against both NARCO and Honeywell pending the reorganization of NARCO. The Company established its initial liability for NARCO asbestos claims in 2002. NARCO emerged from bankruptcy in April 2013, at which time a federally authorized 524(g) trust was established to evaluate and resolve all existing NARCO asbestos claims (the Trust). Both Honeywell and NARCO are protected by a permanent channeling injunction barring all present and future individual actions in state or federal courts and requiring all asbestos-related claims based on exposure to NARCO asbestos-containing products to be made against the Trust. The NARCO Trust Agreement (TA) and the NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures (TDP) are the principal documents setting forth the structure of the Trust, establishing Honeywell’s evergreen funding obligations and the material operating rules for the Trust. Per the TA, the Trust is eligible to receive cash dividends from Harbison-Walker International Inc. (HWI), the reorganized and renamed entity that emerged, fully operational, from the NARCO bankruptcy. The cash dividends are required to be used to pay claims which qualify for payment under the TDP (Annual Contribution Claims) until those funds are exhausted, at which point Honeywell’s funding obligation, subject to an annual cap of $ 145 million, is triggered. The Company is also required to fund amounts owed pursuant to settlement agreements reached during the pendency of the NARCO bankruptcy proceedings that provide for the right to submit claims to the Trust subject to qualification under the terms of the settlement agreements and TDP (Pre-Established Unliquidated Claims), as well as fund the annual operating costs of the Trust. There is no annual funding cap relative to Pre-Established Unliquidated Claims. Dividends from HWI were exhausted during the fourth quarter of 2019 and there have been no further dividends from HWI to date. The operating rules per the TDP include Honeywell’s audit rights and the criteria claimants must meet for a claim to be considered valid and paid, which include adequate medical evidence of the claimant’s asbestos-related condition and credible evidence of exposure to a specific NARCO asbestos-containing product. Once operational in 2014, the Trust began to receive, process and pay claims, at which point the Company began to assert its audit rights to review and monitor the claims processor’s adherence to the established requirements of the TDP. While doing so, the Company identified several issues with the way the Trust was adhering to the TDP and the Company continues to identify and dispute these matters as further claims are processed. Although the Company is attempting to resolve instances where it believes the Trust is not processing claims in accordance with the established TDP, the Company reserves the right to seek judicial intervention should it fail to resolve the disputed issues. Due to the bankruptcy filing in 2002, claimants were not permitted to file additional claims until the Trust became operative in 2014. As a consequence, there was a large backlog of claims that were filed with the Trust upon becoming operative through December 31, 2017, the date by which these claims had to be filed or else be barred by the statute of limitations (subject to tolling exceptions in the TDP). Therefore, the claims filing rate did not start to normalize until 2018 and thereafter. As a result, between 2002 and 2018, the Company lacked a history of sufficiently reliable claims data to derive a reasonable estimate and the Company continued to update its original NARCO asbestos liability, as appropriate, using all available information. With three years of sufficiently reliable claims data, the Company updated its estimate of the NARCO asbestos liability utilizing claims data from January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2020. The Company utilized an asbestos liability valuation specialist to support our preparation of the NARCO asbestos liability estimates. Our estimates, which involve significant management judgment, include consideration of multiple scenarios, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Trust's ability to process claims during 2020. The estimate for the resolution of asserted Annual Contribution Claims and Pre-Established Unliquidated Claims uses average payment values for the relevant historical period. For unasserted claims, the estimate is based on historic and anticipated claims filing experience and payment rates, disease classifications and type of claim, and average payment values by the Trust for the relevant historical period. The Company's estimate also includes all years of epidemiological disease projection through 2059. 88 Honeywell International, Inc. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) Our updated estimate of NARCO asbestos liability, which was consistent with the previously recorded NARCO liability estimate, was $ 779 million as of December 31, 2020. The liability reflects an estimate for the resolution of Annual Contribution Claims and Pre-Established Unliquidated Claims filed with the Trust, as well as unasserted Annual Contribution Claims and Pre-Established Unliquidated Claims. The NARCO asbestos liability excludes the annual operating expenses of the Trust which are expensed as they are incurred. The Company's insurance receivable of $ 254 million as of December 31, 2020, corresponding to the estimated liability for asserted and unasserted NARCO asbestos claims, reflects coverage which reimburses Honeywell for portions of NARCO-related indemnity and defense costs and is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market. Honeywell conducts analyses to estimate the probable amount of insurance that is recoverable for asbestos claims. Most of our insurance carriers remain solvent. However, select individual insurance carriers are now insolvent, which we have considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. Our judgments related to our insurance carriers and insurance coverages are reasonable and consistent with Honeywell's historical dealings and Honeywell's knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers. Bendix Products – Bendix manufactured automotive brake linings that contained chrysotile asbestos in an encapsulated form. Claimants consist largely of individuals who allege exposure to asbestos from brakes from either performing or being in the vicinity of individuals who performed brake replacements. The following tables present information regarding Bendix related asbestos claims activity: Claims Activity Years Ended December 31, 2020 2019 Claims Unresolved at the beginning of year 6,480 6,209 Claims Filed 2,233 2,659 Claims Resolved ( 2,471 ) ( 2,388 ) Claims Unresolved at the end of year 6,242 6,480 Disease Distribution of Unresolved Claims December 31, 2020 2019 Mesothelioma and Other Cancer Claims 3,422 3,399 Nonmalignant Claims 2,820 3,081 Total Claims 6,242 6,480 Honeywell has experienced average resolution values per claim excluding legal costs as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 2017 2016 (in whole dollars) Malignant claims $ 61,500 $ 50,200 $ 55,300 $ 56,000 $ 44,000 Nonmalignant claims $ 550 $ 3,900 $ 4,700 $ 2,800 $ 4,485 It is not possible to predict whether resolution values for Bendix-related asbestos claims will increase, decrease or stabilize in the future. The Consolidated Financial Statements reflect an estimated liability for resolution of asserted (claims filed as of the financial statement date) and unasserted Bendix-related asbestos claims and excludes the Company’s ongoing legal fees to defend such asbestos claims which will continue to be expensed as they are incurred. The Company has valued Bendix asserted and unasserted claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. The Company updates the resolution values used to estimate the cost of Bendix asserted and unasserted claims during the fourth quarter each year. The Company reflects the inclusion of all years of epidemiological disease projection through 2059 when estimating the liability for unasserted Bendix-related asbestos claims. Such liability for unasserted Bendix-related asbestos 89 Honeywell International, Inc. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) claims is based on historic and anticipated claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. The Company's insurance receivable corresponding to the liability for settlement of asserted and unasserted Bendix asbestos claims reflects coverage which is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market. Based on our ongoing analysis of the probable insurance recovery, insurance receivables are recorded in the financial statements simultaneous with the recording of the estimated liability for the underlying asbestos claims. This determination is based on our analysis of the underlying insurance policies, our historical experience with our insurers, our ongoing review of the solvency of our insurers, judicial determinations relevant to our insurance programs, and our consideration of the impacts of any settlements reached with our insurers. On October 31, 2018, David Kanefsky, a Honeywell shareholder, filed a putative class action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 related to the prior accounting for Bendix asbestos claims. An Amended Complaint was filed on December 30, 2019, and on February 7, 2020, we filed a Motion to Dismiss. On May 18, 2020, the court denied our Motion to Dismiss. We believe the claims have no merit. GARRETT MATTER In conjunction with the Garrett spin-off, the Company entered into a binding indemnification and reimbursement agreement (Garrett Indemnity) with a Garrett subsidiary, pursuant to which Garrett’s subsidiary has an ongoing obligation to make cash payments to Honeywell in amounts equal to (i) 90% of Honeywell’s asbestos-related liability payments primarily related to the Bendix business in the United States, as well as certain environmental-related liability payments and accounts payable and non-United States asbestos-related liability payments, including the legal costs of defending and resolving such liabilities, less (ii) 90% of Honeywell’s net insurance receipts and, as may be applicable, certain other recoveries associated with such liabilities. The amount payable to Honeywell in respect of such liabilities arising in any given year is subject to a cap of approximately Euro 150 million (equivalent to $ 175 million at the time the Garrett Indemnity was entered into). The obligation under the terms of the Garrett Indemnity continues until the earlier of December 31, 2048, or December 31 of the third consecutive year during which the annual obligation is less than the Euro equivalent, at the fixed exchange rate at the time the indemnification and reimbursement agreement was entered into, of $ 25 million. On June 12, 2020, the Company and Garrett entered into an amendment of the Garrett Indemnity in connection with Garrett’s amendment of its 2018 credit agreement. These amendments provided Garrett with temporary financial covenant relief with respect to the total leverage and interest coverage ratios, for a period that could extend to as late as June 30, 2022. Garrett’s payments to the Company under the Garrett Indemnity were deferred to the extent Garrett is (or to the extent such payments would cause Garrett to be) out of compliance with the original financial covenants and resume to the extent Garrett is in compliance with such original financial covenants. Any deferred amounts were to be paid to the extent Garrett was in compliance with such original financial covenants and had available capacity to make such payments pursuant to the terms of the Garrett Indemnity and its current credit agreement. Reimbursements associated with the Garrett Indemnity are scheduled under the agreement to be collected from Garrett quarterly and offset operating cash outflows incurred by the Company. As a result of the extension referenced above and below, such amounts were $ 36 million in 2020 as compared with $ 152 million in 2019. As the Company records the accruals for matters covered by the Garrett Indemnity, a corresponding receivable from Garrett is recorded for 90% of that accrual as determined by the terms of the Garrett Indemnity. In conjunction with the spin-off, Honeywell also entered into a binding tax matters agreement with Garrett and a Garrett subsidiary (the Tax Matters Agreement). The Tax Matters Agreement generally provides that Garrett is responsible and must indemnify Honeywell for all ordinary operating taxes, including income taxes, sales taxes, value-added taxes and payroll taxes, relating to Garrett for all periods, including periods prior to the spin-off, to the extent not paid prior to the spin-off date. In addition, among other items, as a result of the mandatory transition tax imposed by the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, Garrett is required to make payments to Honeywell in the amount representing the net tax liability of Honeywell under the mandatory transition tax attributable to Garrett. 90 Honeywell International, Inc. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) GARRETT LITIGATION AND BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS On December 2, 2019, Garrett and Garrett ASASCO Inc. filed a Summons with Notice and commenced a lawsuit in the Commercial Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York (the State Court), seeking to invalidate the Garrett Indemnity. Garrett sought damages and a declaratory judgment based on various claims set forth in the Summons with Notice. On January 15, 2020, Garrett filed its complaint in the action, which asserted the same claims, and on March 5, 2020, we filed a Motion to Dismiss. On June 12, 2020, given the challenges of operating in the COVID-19 environment, Honeywell and Garrett entered into a litigation status agreement pursuant to which (i) the parties agreed to make good faith efforts to limit near-term litigation spend on this matter, and (ii) the Company agreed to extend both the $ 2 million payment owed by Garrett to the Company on May 1, 2020 under the Garrett Indemnity and the $ 18 million payment owed by Garrett to the Company on April 1, 2020 under the Tax Matters Agreement until December 31, 2020 (which amounts, as previously disclosed, had been deferred to May 31, 2020). On July 17, 2020, the Company received a notice from Garrett asserting that Honeywell has caused material breaches of the Tax Matters Agreement and that the Tax Matters Agreement is unenforceable. On September 20, 2020, Garrett and 36 of its affiliates filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the Bankruptcy Court). On September 23, 2020, Garrett moved the existing State Court litigation against Honeywell to the Bankruptcy Court. Honeywell again moved to dismiss all of Garrett’s claims on October 13, 2020. On November 2, 2020, Garrett filed a motion seeking to establish procedures to estimate the value of Honeywell’s claims. Honeywell objected to the motion. On November 18, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court did not rule on the motion to dismiss but suggested that two weeks be set aside in February 2021 for an evidentiary hearing to establish the actual allowed amount or net amount of Honeywell’s claim against Garrett. Honeywell and Garrett agreed to proceed with the estimation of Honeywell’s claims. We believe we have fully complied with our obligations under the Garrett Indemnity and the Tax Matters Agreement and that both agreements are valid and enforceable. Garrett’s operations have and are expected to continue, without interruption, throughout the bankruptcy proceedings. Garrett initially proposed to sell its business while in bankruptcy, and entered into a Share and Asset Purchase Agreement, dated as of September 20, 2020, with KPS Capital Partners, LP (the Stalking Horse Agreement) and filed proposed bidding procedures for a marketing and sale process, auction and other procedures related to the proposed sale. In October 2020, Honeywell signed a coordination agreement with Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. (Oaktree) and Centerbridge Partners, L.P. (Centerbridge), which was subsequently signed by additional equity holders that, collectively with Honeywell, Centerbridge and Oaktree, represent approximately 58% of Garrett’s outstanding common stock and noteholders representing approximately 88% of the principal amount of Garrett’s outstanding senior notes (the Coordination Agreement). The Coordination Agreement and related term sheet set forth the terms of a proposed plan of reorganization (the Initial COH Proposal). In October 2020, the Bankruptcy Court approved the bidding procedures and the Stalking Horse Agreement (as amended), and Garrett conducted a marketing and auction process through January 8, 2021. On January 11, 2021, after further revisions to the Initial COH Proposal, Garrett determined that the revised proposal (the Final COH Plan) was higher and better than all other proposals received and entered into a plan support agreement (the Plan Support Agreement), pursuant to which all parties agreed to pursue Bankruptcy Court confirmation of the Final COH Plan. On January 15, 2021, KPS Capital Partners, LP terminated the Stalking Horse Agreement with Garrett. As set forth in the Plan Support Agreement, the Final COH Plan provides that, if it is confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, Honeywell will receive from Garrett at the time of Garrett’s emergence from bankruptcy an initial payment of $ 375 million in cash and Series B Preferred Stock, which will provide for cash payments to Honeywell of $ 35 million in 2022 and $ 100 million per year from 2023 to 2030 (inclusive), subject to various put and call rights set forth therein. The initial cash payment, together with the Series B Preferred Stock, would be paid/issued in full and final satisfaction of Garrett’s obligations to Honeywell under the Garrett Indemnity and the Tax Matters Agreement. Upon Garrett’s emergence from bankruptcy, both agreements would be terminated, Honeywell and Garrett would mutually release each other from the claims asserted in all pending legal actions, and all pending litigation with Garrett would be resolved. In light of these developments, the hearing scheduled to estimate Honeywell’s claims and the adversary proceeding seeking to invalidate the Indemnity Agreement have been stayed and all related litigation suspended. If the Final COH Plan is confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, both proceedings would be dismissed with prejudice on the effective date of the Final COH Plan. We regularly review the aggregate carrying value of the receivable amounts due in connection with the Garrett Indemnity and the Tax Matters Agreement. Following Garrett’s bankruptcy filing on September 20, 2020, the Company reduced the aggregate carrying value of the receivable by $ 350 million to reflect the present value of 91 Honeywell International, Inc. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) amounts owed to us over the full term of these agreements. Because Garrett is now a party to the Plan Support Agreement, we believe the present value of payments to Honeywell under the Final COH Plan, discounted at a rate reflective of the terms of the agreement, is an appropriate estimate of receivable amounts. On this basis, Honeywell recorded an additional adjustment of $ 92 million to lower the aggregate carrying value of the receivable amounts due in connection with the Garrett Indemnity and Tax Matters Agreement to $ 959 million as of December 31, 2020. Other Current Assets and Other Assets include $ 10 million and $ 949 million, respectively, for the short-term and long-term portion of the receivable amount due from the Garrett Indemnity and Tax Matters Agreement. As of December 31, 2019, Other Current Assets and Other Assets include $ 133 million and $ 1,188 million, respectively, for the short-term and long-term portion of the receivable amount due from the Garrett Indemnity and Tax Matters Agreement. For the year ended December 31, 2020, a non-cash charge of $ 509 million is recognized in Other (income) expense, which includes the adjustments to the carrying value of the receivable described above. There can be no assurance that the Final COH Plan will be confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court or that Garrett will be able to substantially consummate the restructuring transactions contemplated in the Final COH Plan. The ultimate outcome of the bankruptcy process is uncertain. Depending on the transaction and/or plan of reorganization ultimately approved and confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, the amount collected could differ from the receivable amounts currently recorded in our financial statements. There can be no assurance that recording an additional adjustment (positive or negative) against the remaining receivable amounts in whole or in part (together with a related statement of operations charge) will not be necessary in a future period or periods. Honeywell will continue to participate in the Bankruptcy Court proceedings in order to appropriately assess and enforce our rights in this matter. Should the Final COH Plan not be confirmed in the form currently contemplated, Honeywell intends to vigorously defend its rights to collect amounts due under the Garrett Indemnity and Tax Matters Agreement with Garrett. OTHER MATTERS The Company is subject to a number of other lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability, prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, and environmental, health and safety matters. We recognize a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. We continually assess the likelihood of adverse judgments or outcomes in these matters, as well as potential ranges of possible losses (taking into consideration any insurance recoveries), based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Included in these other matters is the following: Honeywell v. United Auto Workers (UAW) et. al – In September 2011, the UAW and certain Honeywell retirees (Plaintiffs) filed a suit in the Eastern District of Michigan (the District Court) alleging that a series of Master Collective Bargaining Agreements (MCBAs) between Honeywell and the UAW provided the retirees with rights to lifetime, vested healthcare benefits that could never be changed or reduced. Plaintiffs alleged that Honeywell had violated those vested rights by implementing express limitations (CAPS) on the amount Honeywell contributed toward healthcare coverage for the retirees. Honeywell subsequently answered the UAW’s complaint and asserted counterclaims, including for breach of implied warranty. Between 2014 and 2015, Honeywell began enforcing the CAPS against former employees. In response, the UAW and certain of the Plaintiffs filed a motion seeking a ruling that the MCBAs do not limit Honeywell’s obligation to contribute to healthcare coverage for those retirees. On March 29, 2018, the District Court issued its opinion resolving all pending summary judgment motions, except for Honeywell’s counterclaim for breach of implied warranty, which has since been dismissed without prejudice. In the opinion, the District Court held that the MCBAs do not promise retirees vested, lifetime benefits that survive expiration of the MCBAs. Based on this ruling, Honeywell terminated the retirees healthcare coverage benefits altogether as of July 31, 2018. In response, the UAW filed a motion to enjoin Honeywell from completely terminating coverage as of July 31, 2018, arguing that the CAPS themselves are vested and that Honeywell must continue to provide retiree medical benefits at the capped level. On July 28, 2018, the District Court denied the UAW’s motion and entered a final judgment consistent with its March 2018 ruling. The UAW appealed this decision to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. In the March 2018 opinion, the District Court also held that Honeywell is obligated under the MCBAs to pay the “full premium” for retiree healthcare rather than the capped amount. Based on this ruling, Honeywell would be required 92 Honeywell International, Inc. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) to pay monetary damages to retirees for any past years in which Honeywell paid less than the “full premium” of their healthcare coverage. Such damages would be limited, depending on the retiree group, to a two to three-year period ending when the 2017 MCBA expired, and Honeywell would have no ongoing obligation to continue funding healthcare coverage for subsequent periods. Honeywell appealed the District Court’s ruling on this “full premium” damages issue. On April 3, 2020, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals issued an opinion ruling for Honeywell in all respects. The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's ruling that the MCBAs do not promise retirees vested, lifetime benefits that survive expiration of the MCBAs. In addition, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's ruling that Honeywell was obligated under the MCBAs to pay the ""full premium"" for retiree healthcare, rather than the capped amount. As a result of these rulings, Honeywell is not required to pay any monetary damages to the Plaintiffs. Plaintiffs sought rehearing en banc from the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, which petition was denied. Plaintiffs failed to timely appeal the Sixth Circuit's ruling to the Supreme Court of the United States. Accordingly, as of October 8, 2020, the case was fully resolved. Petrobras and Unaoil – We are cooperating with certain investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the SEC and Brazilian authorities relating to our use of third parties who previously worked for our UOP business in Brazil in relation to Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. (Petrobras). The investigations are focused on compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar Brazilian laws, and involve, among other things, document production and interviews with former and current management and employees. The DOJ and the SEC are also examining a matter involving a foreign subsidiary’s prior engagement of Unaoil S.A.M. in Algeria. We are cooperating with the authorities in each of the above matters. While we cannot predict the outcome of these matters, based on the facts currently known to us, we do not anticipate that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. Given the uncertainty inherent in litigation and investigations (including the specific matters referenced above), we do not believe it is possible to develop estimates of reasonably possible loss in excess of current accruals for these matters (other than as specifically set forth above). Considering our past experience and existing accruals, we do not expect the outcome of these matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, potential liabilities are subject to change due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, which could cause us to pay damage awards or settlements (or become subject to equitable remedies) that could have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Results of Operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid. WARRANTIES AND GUARANTEES In the normal course of business, the Company issues product warranties and product performance guarantees. We accrue for the estimated cost of product warranties and performance guarantees based on contract terms and historical experience at the time of sale. Adjustments to initial obligations for warranties and guarantees are made as changes to the obligations become reasonably estimable. The following table summarizes information concerning our recorded obligations for product warranties and product performance guarantees.

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS The Company sponsors a number of both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Pension benefits for many of our U.S. employees are provided through non-contributory, qualified and non-qualified defined benefit plans. All non-union hourly and salaried employees joining Honeywell for the first time after December 31, 2012, are not eligible to participate in Honeywell’s U.S. defined benefit pension plans. We also sponsor defined benefit pension plans which cover non-U.S. employees who are not U.S. citizens, in certain jurisdictions, principally the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and Canada. Other pension plans outside of the U.S. are not material to the Company either individually or in the aggregate. The Company also sponsors postretirement benefit plans that provide health care benefits and life insurance coverage mainly to U.S. eligible retirees. None of Honeywell’s U.S. employees are eligible for a retiree medical subsidy from the Company. In addition, the vast majority of Honeywell’s U.S. retirees either have no Company subsidy or have a fixed-dollar subsidy amount. This significantly limits our exposure to the impact of future health care cost increases. The retiree medical and life insurance plans are not funded. Claims and expenses are paid from our cash flows from operations. 94 Honeywell International, Inc. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) Major actuarial assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations and net periodic benefit (income) cost for our significant benefit plans are presented in the following table as weighted averages. Pension Benefits U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans 2020 2019 2018 2020 2019 2018 Actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations as of December 31: Discount rate 2.50 % 3.22 % 4.35 % 1.23 % 1.81 % 2.63 % Expected annual rate of compensation increase 3.25 % 3.25 % 3.25 % 2.43 % 2.47 % 2.46 % Actuarial assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit (income) cost for years ended December 31: Discount rate—benefit obligation 3.22 % 4.35 % 3.68 % 1.81 % 2.63 % 2.36 % Discount rate—service cost 3.33 % 4.47 % 3.77 % 1.48 % 2.26 % 2.20 % Discount rate—interest cost 2.76 % 3.94 % 3.27 % 1.56 % 2.34 % 2.08 % Expected rate of return on plan assets 6.15 % 6.75 % 7.75 % 4.66 % 5.14 % 6.23 % Expected annual rate of compensation increase 3.25 % 3.25 % 4.50 % 2.47 % 2.46 % 2.49 % Other Postretirement Benefits 2020 2019 2018 Actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations as of December 31: Discount rate 2.20 % 3.03 % 4.07 % Actuarial assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for years ended December 31: Discount rate (1) 2.36 % 4.07 % 3.39 % (1) Discount rate was 3.03 % for January 1, 2020 through September 30, 2020. The rate was changed to 2.36 % for the remainder of 2020 due to a Plan remeasurement as of October 1, 2020. The discount rate for the Company's U.S. pension and other postretirement benefits plans reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be settled at the measurement date of December 31. To determine discount rates for our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans, we use a modeling process that involves matching the expected cash outflows of our benefit plans to a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments. We use the single weighted-average yield of this hypothetical portfolio as a discount rate benchmark. We utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension benefit (income) for our significant pension plans. This approach applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the pension benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows and provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected cash flows and their corresponding spot rates. For our U.S. pension plans, the single weighted average spot rates used to determine service and interest costs for 2021 are 2.67 % and 1.76 %. The discount rate used to determine the other postretirement benefit obligation is lower principally due to a shorter expected duration of other postretirement plan obligations as compared to pension plan obligations. 99 Honeywell International, Inc. HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in tables in millions, except per share amounts) The Company plans to use an expected rate of return on U.S. plan assets of 6.15 % for 2021, matching the 6.15 % assumption used for 2020. Our asset return assumption is based on historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with current market conditions and broad asset mix considerations with a focus on long-term trends rather than short-term market conditions. We review the expected rate of return on an annual basis and revise it as appropriate. For non-U.S. benefit plans actuarial assumptions reflect economic and market factors relevant to each country. PENSION BENEFITS The following amounts relate to the Company's significant pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations exceeding the fair value of plan assets: December 31, U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans 2020 2019 2020 2019 Projected benefit obligation $ 353 $ 357 $ 2,116 $ 1,018 Accumulated benefit obligation $ 341 $ 347 $ 2,042 $ 973 Fair value of plan assets $ — $ — $ 1,208 $ 233 The accumulated benefit obligation for the Company's U.S. defined benefit pension plans was $ 17.9 billion and $ 17.2 billion and for our Non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans was $ 7.6 billion and $ 6.8 billion at December 31, 2020 and 2019. The Company's asset investment strategy for our U.S. pension plans focuses on maintaining a diversified portfolio using various asset classes in order to achieve our long-term investment objectives on a risk adjusted basis. During 2020, we continued to employ a de-risking strategy which increases the matching characteristics of our assets relative to our obligation. Our long-term target allocations are as follows: 55 %- 70 % fixed income securities and cash, 25 %- 40 % equity securities, 5 %- 10 % real estate investments, and 10 %- 20 % other types of investments. Equity securities include publicly-traded stock of companies located both inside and outside the United States. Fixed income securities include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, mortgage-backed securities, and U.S. Treasuries. Real estate investments include direct investments in commercial properties and investments in real estate funds. Other types of investments include investments in private equity and hedge funds that follow several different strategies. We review our assets on a regular basis to ensure that we are within the targeted asset allocation ranges and, if necessary, asset balances are adjusted back within target allocations. The Company's non-U.S. pension assets are typically managed by decentralized fiduciary committees with the Honeywell Corporate Investments group providing funding and investment guidance. Our non-U.S. investment policies are different for each country as local regulations, funding requirements, and financial and tax considerations are part of the funding and investment allocation process in each country. In accordance with ASU 2015-07, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820)”, certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value (NAV) per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in the following tables are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented for the total pension benefits plan assets. 100 Honeywell International, Inc.

Sufficient cash or cash equivalents are held by our pension plans to cover the notional value of the futures contracts. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, our U.S. plans had contracts with notional amounts of $ 3,673 million and $ 4,463 million. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, our non-U.S. plans had contracts with notional amounts of $ 564 million and $ 479 million. In both our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, the notional derivative exposure is related to outstanding equity and fixed income futures contracts. Common stocks, preferred stocks, real estate investment trusts, and short-term investments are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded. Corporate bonds, mortgages/asset-backed securities, and government securities are valued either by using pricing models, bids provided by brokers or dealers, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows and as such include adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks. Certain securities are held in collective trust funds which are valued using net asset values provided by the administrators of the funds. Investments in private equity, debt, real estate and hedge funds and direct private investments are valued at estimated fair value based on quarterly financial information received from the investment advisor and/or general partner. Investments in real estate properties are valued on a quarterly basis using the income approach. Valuation estimates are periodically supplemented by third party appraisals. The insurance buy-in contracts represent policies held by the Honeywell UK Pension Scheme, whereby the cost of providing pension benefits to plan participants is funded by the policies. The cash flows from the policies are intended to match the pension benefits. The fair value of these policies is based on an estimate of the policies' exit price. The Company's funding policy for qualified defined benefit pension plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to satisfy regulatory funding standards. In 2020, 2019, and 2018, we were not required to make contributions to our U.S. pension plans and no contributions were made. We are not required to make any contributions to our U.S. pension plans in 2021. In 2020, contributions of $ 109 million were made to our non-U.S. pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding requirements.

Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the shareowners and the Board of Directors of Honeywell International Inc. Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Honeywell International Inc. and subsidiaries (the ""Company"" or ""Honeywell"") as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareowners’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the ""financial statements""). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“generally accepted accounting principles”). Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 110 Honeywell International, Inc. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Asbestos Related Liabilities - North American Refractories Company (NARCO) Asbestos Liability – Refer to Note 20 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company records an estimated liability for asbestos related personal injury claims related to a predecessor company, NARCO. Such claims arise primarily from alleged occupational exposure to asbestos-containing refractory brick and mortar. The Company’s NARCO asbestos liability reflects an estimated liability for the resolution of asserted and unasserted NARCO-related asbestos claims that are probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. The Company records an estimated liability for the resolution of asserted Annual Contribution Claims and Pre-Established Unliquidated Claims filed with the NARCO Trust using average payment values for the relevant historical period. The Company also records an estimated liability for unasserted Annual Contribution Claims and Pre-Established Unliquidated Claims based on historic and anticipated claims filing experience and payment rates, disease classifications and type of claim, and average payment values by the NARCO Trust for the relevant historical period. The Company’s estimate also includes all years of epidemiological disease projection through 2059 when estimating the liability for unasserted claims. Establishing the NARCO asbestos liability is an inherently subjective exercise as it requires management to make significant assumptions and judgements. Given the subjectivity related to estimating the NARCO asbestos liability and the lack of a history of sufficiently reliable claims data, auditing of the NARCO asbestos liability involved especially subjective judgment. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the NARCO asbestos liability included the following, among others: • We tested the effectiveness of internal controls over the estimate of the NARCO asbestos liability including management’s controls over the estimate for asserted and unasserted Annual Contribution Claims and Pre-Established Unliquidated Claims. • We evaluated the methods and assumptions used by management to estimate the NARCO asbestos liability by: ◦ Reading the Company’s analysis and third-party assessment to evaluate the Company’s methods used in the analysis. ◦ Confirming the claims data with the NARCO Trust to evaluate the appropriateness of the underlying data used in the analysis. ◦ Making inquiries of the Company’s third-party specialist to identify the significant assumptions used to develop the analysis. ◦ Making inquiries of internal and external legal counsel regarding the regulatory and litigation environments related to the NARCO asbestos liability. • With the assistance of our internal actuarial specialists, we developed a range of independent estimates and compared those to the Company’s recorded NARCO asbestos Liability. 111 Honeywell International, Inc. Revenue Recognition and Contracts with Customers – Long-Term Fixed Price Contracts (Performance Materials and Technologies (PMT)) – Refer to Note 1 and Note 3 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company’s PMT segment develops and manufactures performance chemicals and materials, process technologies, and automation solutions. A portion of PMT’s revenue is generated from long-term fixed price contracts whereby revenue is recognized over the contract term (“over time”) as the work progresses and control of the goods and services is transferred to the customer. Revenue for these contracts is recognized based on the extent of progress toward completion, generally measured by using a cost-to-cost basis input method. Accounting for PMT’s long-term fixed price contracts requires management’s judgment in estimating total contract costs. Contract costs, which can be incurred over several years, are largely determined based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms and consider factors such as historical performance, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, and anticipated labor agreements. Given the significant judgments necessary to estimate costs associated with these long-term contracts, auditing PMT’s long-term fixed price contracts requires a high degree of auditor judgment. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to PMT’s long-term fixed price contracts included the following, among others: • We tested the effectiveness of internal controls over the recognition of revenue and the determination of estimated contract costs including controls over the review of management’s assumptions and key inputs used to recognize revenue and costs on long-term fixed price contracts using the cost-to-cost input method. • We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management’s methods and assumptions used to recognize revenue and costs on long-term fixed price contracts using the cost-to-cost input method to recognize revenue over time. • We selected a sample of long-term fixed price contracts and evaluated the estimates of total cost for each of the long-term fixed price contracts by: ◦ Comparing costs incurred to date to the costs management estimated to be incurred to date. ◦ Evaluating management’s ability to achieve the estimates of total cost by performing corroborating inquiries with Company personnel, including project managers, and comparing the estimates to documentation such as management’s work plans, contract terms and requirements, and purchase orders with suppliers. Our evaluation of management’s assumptions included consideration of historical and current project performance such as consistency of gross margin, identified risks related to project timing including technical and schedule matters, and the status of internal and third party activities such as hardware, software, and labor. Reimbursement Receivables - Garrett Motion Inc. (Garrett) – Refer to Note 20 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description In connection with the spin-off of Garrett in October 2018, the Company entered into a binding indemnification and reimbursement agreement (Garrett Indemnity) with a Garrett subsidiary and a binding tax matters agreement with Garrett and a Garrett subsidiary (the Tax Matters Agreement). Accordingly, the Company recorded a receivable based on estimates of the amounts reimbursable to Honeywell. On September 20, 2020, Garrett and 36 of its affiliates filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York (the Bankruptcy Court). In October 2020, the Company signed a coordination agreement with Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. (Oaktree) and Centerbridge Partners, L.P. (Centerbridge), which was subsequently signed by additional equity holders that, collectively with Honeywell, Centerbridge and Oaktree, represent approximately 58% of Garrett’s outstanding common stock and noteholders representing approximately 88% of the principal amount of Garrett’s outstanding senior notes (the Coordination Agreement). The Coordination Agreement and related term sheet set forth the terms of a proposed plan of reorganization (the Initial COH Proposal). On January 11, 2021, after further revisions to the Initial COH Proposal, Garrett determined that the revised proposal (the Final COH Plan) was higher and better than all other proposals received and entered into a plan support agreement (the Plan Support Agreement), pursuant to which all parties agreed to pursue Bankruptcy Court confirmation of the Final COH Plan. Because Garrett is now a party to the Plan Support Agreement, the Company believes the present value of payments to Honeywell under the Final COH Plan, discounted at a rate reflective of the terms of the agreement, is an appropriate estimate of receivable amounts due in connection with the Garrett Indemnity and Tax Matters Agreement. 112 Honeywell International, Inc. Given the subjectivity in determining the present value of payments under the Final COH Plan, the auditing of the receivable amounts due in connection with the Garrett Indemnity and Tax Matters Agreement required a high degree of auditor judgment. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the receivable amounts due in connection with the Garrett Indemnity and Tax Matters Agreement included the following, among others: • We tested the effectiveness of internal controls related to management’s evaluation of the recoverability of the receivable amounts due from Garrett. • We made inquiries of internal legal counsel regarding the Garrett bankruptcy proceedings. • We developed an understanding of the process used by management in determining the aggregate carrying balance of the receivable amounts due in connection with the Garrett Indemnity and Tax Matters Agreement, which included obtaining and reading the Final COH Plan, evaluating the Company’s methods, evaluating the appropriateness of the underlying data used, and the identification of significant assumptions used to develop the accounting estimate. • With the assistance of our internal valuation specialists, we developed an independent expectation of the fair value of the Final COH Plan and compared our expectation to the Company’s recorded amount. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP February 12, 2021 We have served as the Company's auditor since 2014. 113 Honeywell International, Inc. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE Not Applicable. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES Honeywell management maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the specified time periods and accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There have been no changes that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Honeywell’s internal control over financial reporting that have occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2020. Our management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) as of December 31, 2020. Based on these evaluations, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2020. MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING Honeywell management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act. Honeywell’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Management assessed the effectiveness of Honeywell’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) . We have not experienced any material impact to our internal control over financial reporting during the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of our employees worked remotely during the year in which we prepared these financial statements due to the impact of COVID-19. We enhanced our oversight and monitoring during the close and reporting process, including investments in expanded VPN capabilities and higher scrutiny and monitoring of cybersecurity threats. Other than enhancing our oversight and monitoring processes, we did not alter or compromise our disclosure controls and procedures. We are continually monitoring and assessing the need to modify or enhance our disclosure controls to ensure disclosure controls and procedures continue to be effective. Based on this assessment, management determined that Honeywell maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In conducting management's evaluation as described above, Rocky Research acquired October 7, 2020, and Sine Group acquired December 14, 2020, were excluded. The operations of Rocky Research and Sine Group, excluded from management's assessment of internal control over financial reporting, collectively represent less than 0.1% of the Company's total revenues and approximately 0.5% of total assets as of December 31, 2020. The effectiveness of Honeywell’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in the section titled Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.

Employee Directors (including 210,822 shares of Common Stock to be issued for options; and 15,759 RSUs subject to continued services). RSUs included in column (a) of the table represent the full number of RSUs awarded and outstanding whereas the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon vesting will be lower than what is reflected on the table because the value of shares required to meet employee tax withholding requirements are not issued. Because the number of future shares that may be distributed to employees participating in the Honeywell Global Stock Plan is unknown, no shares attributable to that plan are included in column (a) of the table above. (2) Column (b) relates to stock options and does not include any exercise price for RSUs because an RSU’s value is dependent upon attainment of certain performance goals or continued employment or service and they are settled for shares of Common Stock on a one-for-one basis. (3) The number of shares that may be issued under the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan as of December 31, 2020 is 34,104,522, which includes the following additional shares that may again be available for issuance: shares that are settled for cash, expire, are canceled, or under similar prior plans, are tendered as option exercise price or tax withholding obligations, are reacquired with cash option exercise price or with monies attributable to any tax deduction to Honeywell upon the exercise of an option, or are under any outstanding awards assumed under any equity compensation plan of an entity acquired by the Company. No securities are available for future issuance under the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan or the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan. The number of shares that may be issued under the Honeywell Global Stock Plan as of December 31, 2020 is 1,736,279. This plan is an umbrella plan for three plans described below maintained solely for eligible employees of participating non-U.S. countries. • The UK Sharebuilder Plan allows an eligible UK employee to invest taxable earnings in Common Stock. The Company matches those shares and dividends paid are used to purchase additional shares of Common Stock. For the year ending December 31, 2020, 32,717 shares were credited to participants’ accounts under the UK Sharebuilder Plan. • The Honeywell Aerospace Ireland Share Participation Plan and the Honeywell Measurex (Ireland) Limited Group Employee Profit Sharing Plan allow eligible Irish employees to contribute a percentage of base pay and/or bonus that is invested in Common Stock. For the year ending December 31, 2020, 1,816 shares of Common Stock were credited to participants’ accounts under these plans. The remaining 832,309 shares included in column (c) are shares remaining under the 2016 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors . (4) Equity compensation plans not approved by shareowners included in the table refer to the Honeywell Excess Benefit Plan and Supplemental Savings Plan. The Honeywell Excess Benefit Plan and Supplemental Savings Plan for highly compensated employees is an unfunded, non-tax qualified plan that provides benefits equal to the employee deferrals and Company matching allocations that would have been provided under Honeywell’s U.S. tax-qualified savings plan if the Internal Revenue Code limitations on compensation and contributions did not apply. The Company matching contribution is credited to participants’ accounts in the form of notional shares of Common Stock. The notional shares are distributed in the form of actual shares of Common Stock. The number of shares to be issued under this plan based on the value of the notional shares as of December 31, 2020 is 261,718. (5) Column (b) does not include any exercise price for notional shares allocated to employees under Honeywell’s equity compensation plans not approved by shareowners because all of these shares are only settled for shares of Common Stock on a one-for-one basis. (6) The amount of securities available for future issuance under the Honeywell Excess Benefit Plan and Supplemental Savings Plan is not determinable because the number of securities that may be issued under this plan depends upon the amount deferred to the plan by participants in future years. 116 Honeywell International, Inc.

We use the single weighted-average yield of this hypothetical portfolio as a discount rate benchmark. We utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension benefit (income) for our significant pension plans. This approach applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the pension benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows and provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected cash flows and their corresponding spot rates. For our U.S. pension plans, the single weighted average spot rates used to determine service and interest costs for 2020 are 3.33% and 2.76%. The discount rate used to determine the other postretirement benefit obligation is lower principally due to a shorter expected duration of other postretirement plan obligations as compared to pension plan obligations.

This approach applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the pension benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows and provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected cash flows and their corresponding spot rates. For our U.S. pension plans, the single weighted average spot rates used to determine service and interest costs for 2020 are 3.33% and 2.76%. The discount rate used to determine the other postretirement benefit obligation is lower principally due to a shorter expected duration of other postretirement plan obligations as compared to pension plan obligations.

Honeywell has appealed the District Court’s ruling on this “full premium” damages issue, and believes that the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals will reverse the District Court on that issue.

Competition We are subject to competition in substantially all product and service areas. Some of our key competitors are: • Aerospace: Garmin, Safran, Thales, and United Technologies • Honeywell Building Technologies: Johnson Controls, Schneider Electric, Siemens and United Technologies • Performance Materials and Technologies: Albemarle, BASF, Dupont, Emerson Electric, Schneider Electric, Siemens, Sinopec and Yokogawa • Safety and Productivity Solutions: 3M, Kion Group, Mine Safety Appliances (MSA), TE Connectivity, and Zebra Technologies Our businesses compete on a variety of factors such as price, quality, reliability, delivery, customer service, performance, applied technology, product innovation and product recognition. Brand identity, service to customers and quality are important competitive factors for our products and services, and there is considerable price competition. Other competitive factors include breadth of product line, research and development efforts and technical and managerial capability. While our competitive position varies among our products and services, we believe we are a significant competitor in each of our major product and service classes. Many of our competitors have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities. In addition, some of our products compete with the captive component divisions of OEMs. U.S. Government Sales Sales to the U.S. Government (principally by Aerospace), acting through its various departments and agencies and through prime contractors, amounted to $4,057 million, $3,403 million and $3,203 million in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , which included sales to the U.S. Department of Defense, as a prime contractor and subcontractor, of $3,491 million, $2,832 million and $2,546 million in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . We do not expect our overall operating results to be significantly affected by any proposed changes in 2020 federal defense spending due principally to the varied mix of the government programs which impact us (OEMs’ production, engineering development programs, aftermarket spares and repairs and overhaul programs), as well as our diversified commercial businesses. 2 International Operations We engage in manufacturing, sales, service and research and development (R&D) globally. U.S. exports and non-U.S. manufactured products are significant to our operations. U.S. exports comprised 15% of our total sales in 2019 , 13% in 2018 and 12% in 2017 . Non-U.S. manufactured products and services, mainly in Europe and Asia, were 40% of our total sales in 2019 , 43% in 2018 and 44% in 2017 . Manufactured Products and Systems and Performance of Services Year Ended December 31, 2019 Aerospace Honeywell Building Technologies Performance Materials and Technologies Safety and Productivity Solutions (% of Segment Sales) U.S. Exports 25 % 2 % 16 % 2 % Non-U.S. manufactured/services 19 % 64 % 56 % 41 % Information related to risks attendant to our foreign operations is included in Item 1A. Risk Factors under the caption “Macroeconomic and Industry Risks.” Backlog Our backlog represents the estimated remaining value of work to be performed under firm contracts. Backlog is equal to our remaining performance obligations under the contracts that meet the guidance on revenue from contracts with customers as discussed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Backlog was $25,612 million and $24,850 million at December 31, 2019 and 2018 . We expect to recognize approximately 57% of our remaining performance obligations as revenue in 2020 , and the remaining balance thereafter. Raw Materials The principal raw materials used in our operations are readily available. Although we occasionally experience disruption in raw materials supply, we experienced no significant problems in the purchase of key raw materials or commodities in 2019 . We are not dependent on any one supplier for a material amount of our raw materials. Prices of certain key raw materials, including copper, fluorspar, tungsten salts, ethylene, aluminum, and molybdenum in Performance Materials and Technologies and nickel, steel, titanium and other metals in Aerospace, are expected to fluctuate. We offset raw material cost increases with formula or long-term supply agreements, price increases and hedging activities where feasible. We do not presently anticipate that a shortage of raw materials will cause any material adverse impacts during 2020 . Patents, Trademarks, Licenses and Distribution Rights Our segments are not dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents, or any licenses or distribution rights. In our judgment, our intellectual property rights are adequate for the conduct of our business. We believe that, in the aggregate, the rights under our patents, trademarks and licenses are generally important to our operations, but we do not consider any individual patent, trademark or any licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process or product to be of material importance in relation to our total business. 3 Environment We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements regarding protection of human health and the environment. Our policies, practices and procedures are designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage, and of resulting financial liability, in connection with our business. Some risk of environmental damage is, however, inherent in some of our operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses. We engage in the handling, manufacturing, use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous by one or more regulatory agencies. Our policies, practices and procedures are designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury, and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of these substances meet or exceed environmental and safety laws and regulations. It is possible that future knowledge or other developments, such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies, could bring into question our current or past handling, manufacture, use or disposal of these substances. Among other environmental requirements, we are subject to the federal Superfund and similar state and foreign laws and regulations, under which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated with current and former operating sites and various hazardous waste sites, some of which are on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s National Priority List. While there is a possibility that a responsible party might be unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible parties, we do not anticipate having to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multi-party situations taken as a whole. We do not believe that Federal, State and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, or any existing or pending climate change legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on the Company’s business. We will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area. Employees We have approximately 113,000 employees at December 31, 2019 , of whom approximately 44,000 are located in the United States. 4 Information About our Executive Officers The executive officers of Honeywell, listed as follows, are elected annually by the Board of Directors.

Risk Factors Cautionary Statement About Forward-Looking Statements We describe many of the trends and other factors that drive our business and future results in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in other parts of this report (including this Item 1A). Such discussions contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are those that address activities, events or developments that management intends, expects, projects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future. They are based on management’s assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends, current economic and industry conditions, expected future developments and other relevant factors. They are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results, developments and business decisions may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forward-looking statements. We do not undertake to update or revise any of our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the near- and long-term. These forward-looking statements should be considered in light of the information included in this Form 10-K, including, in particular, the factors discussed below. These factors may be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. 5 Risk Factors Our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition are subject to the principal risks and uncertainties set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. Macroeconomic and Industry Risks Each of our businesses is subject to unique industry and economic conditions that may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations. • Aerospace —Our Aerospace business is impacted by customer buying patterns of aftermarket parts, supplier stability, factory transitions and global supply chain capacity constraints that may lead to shortages of crucial components. Operating results may be adversely affected by downturns in the global demand for air travel which impacts new aircraft production or the delay or cancellation of new aircraft orders, delays in launch schedules for new aircraft, the retirement of aircraft and global flying hours, which impact air transport, regional, business and general aviation aircraft utilization rates. Operating results may be adversely affected by the decrease in air travel demand due to regional restrictions or suspension of service for public health, safety, or environmental events. Operating results could also be impacted by changes in overall trends related to end market demand for the product portfolio, as well as, new entrants and non-traditional players entering the market. Operating results in our Defense and Space business unit may be affected by the mix of U.S. and foreign government appropriations for defense and space programs and by compliance risks. Results may also be impacted by the potential introduction of counterfeit parts into our global supply chain. • Honeywell Building Technologies —Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in the level of global commercial construction activity (including retrofits and upgrades), lower capital spending and operating expenditures on building projects, less industrial plant expansion, changes in the competitive landscape including new market entrants and new technologies, and fluctuations in inventory levels in distribution channels. • Performance Materials and Technologies —Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, refining, petrochemical and semiconductor plants, our customers’ availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion, raw material demand and supply volatility, product commoditization, continued illegal imports of hydrofluorocarbons into Europe and our ability to maximize our facilities’ production capacity and minimize downtime. In particular, the volatility in oil and natural gas prices have and will continue to impact our customers’ operating levels and capital spending and thus demand for our products and services. • Safety and Productivity Solutions —Operating results may be adversely impacted by reduced investments in process automation, safety monitoring, and plant capacity utilization initiatives, fluctuations in retail markets, lower customer demand due to the failure to anticipate and respond to overall trends related to end market demand, changes in the competitive landscape including new market entrants and technology that may lead to product commoditization, and adverse industry economic conditions, all of which could result in lower market share, reduced selling prices and lower margins. An increasing percentage of our sales and operations is in non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory, foreign exchange and other risks of international operations. Our international operations, including U.S. exports, represent more than half of the Company’s sales. Risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations, wage and price controls, antitrust regulations, employment regulations, foreign investment laws, import, export and other trade restrictions (such as sanctions and embargoes), differing levels of protection of intellectual property, acts of industrial espionage, violations by our employees of anti-corruption laws (despite our efforts to mitigate these risks), changes in regulations regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private enterprises, acts of terrorism, and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions. Instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment, and the evolving international and domestic political, regulatory and economic landscape, the potential for changes in global trade policies including sanctions and trade barriers, trends such as populism, economic nationalism and negative sentiment toward multinational companies, and the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins. 6 While there is uncertainty regarding the final outcome and full terms of the United Kingdom’s future relationship with the European Union, it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the United Kingdom and other countries, including the United States, increased tariffs on U.K. imports and exports, and increased regulatory complexities. The Company has developed plans to mitigate the potential impact of these possible restrictions, but the implications of these uncertainties could affect the Company's business, financial position and results of operations. Existing free trade laws and regulations provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products or from where we import products or raw materials, either directly or through our suppliers, could have an impact on our competitive position and financial results. The United States has commenced certain trade actions, including imposing tariffs on certain goods imported from China and other countries, which has resulted in retaliatory tariffs by China and other countries. Additional tariffs imposed by the United States on a broader range of imports, or further retaliatory trade measures taken by China or other countries in response, could increase the cost of our products. Operating outside of the United States also exposes us to foreign exchange risk, which we monitor and seek to reduce through hedging activities. However, foreign exchange hedging activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us or be successful in eliminating such volatility. Finally, we generate significant amounts of cash outside of the United States that is invested with financial and non-financial counterparties. While we employ comprehensive controls regarding global cash management to guard against cash or investment loss and to ensure our ability to fund our operations and commitments, a material disruption to the counterparties with whom we transact business could expose Honeywell to financial loss. Operating outside the United States also exposes us to additional intellectual property risk. The laws and enforcement practices of certain jurisdictions in which we operate may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as in the U.S. and may impose joint venture, technology transfer, local service or other foreign investment requirements and restrictions that potentially compromise control over our technology and proprietary information. Failure of foreign jurisdictions to protect our intellectual property rights, an inability to effectively enforce such rights in foreign jurisdictions, or the imposition of foreign jurisdiction investment or sourcing restrictions or requirements could result in loss of valuable proprietary information and could impact our competitive position and financial results. Risks related to our defined benefit pension plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow. Significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets, discount rates, and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and require cash pension contributions in future periods. Changes in discount rates and actual asset returns different than our anticipated asset returns can result in significant non-cash actuarial gains or losses which we record in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and, if applicable, in any quarter in which an interim re-measurement is triggered. With regard to cash pension contributions, funding requirements for our pension plans are largely dependent upon interest rates, actual investment returns on pension assets and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations. We may be required to transition from the use of the LIBOR interest rate index in the future. We have certain contracts indexed to LIBOR to calculate the interest rate. The continued availability of the LIBOR index is not guaranteed after 2021. We cannot predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted. The language in certain of our LIBOR-based contracts identify various events that trigger when a successor rate to the designated rate would be selected. If a trigger is satisfied, such contracts may give the calculation agent discretion over the substitute index or indices for the calculation of interest rates to be selected. The implementation of a substitute index or indices for the calculation of interest rates under our contracts may result in our incurring significant expenses in effecting the transition and may result in disputes or litigation over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute index or indices, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. 7 Operational Risks Raw material price fluctuations, the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements, or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services, impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities. The cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products, particularly in Performance Materials and Technologies (copper, fluorspar, tungsten salts, ethylene, aluminum, and molybdenum) and in Aerospace (nickel, steel, titanium and other metals). Our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices to customers, formula or long-term fixed price contracts with suppliers, productivity actions or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations. Many major components, product equipment items and raw materials, particularly in Aerospace, are procured or subcontracted on a single or sole-source basis. Although we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process and we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate, it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases may have in the future. Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers’ inability to scale production and adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile demand. Our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts, which could, in turn, result in reduced sales and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships. We may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions, and divestitures may not occur as planned. We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest non-core businesses. We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by (i) the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns, including risk of impairment; (ii) the failure to integrate multiple acquired businesses into Honeywell simultaneously and on schedule and/or to achieve expected synergies; (iii) the inability to dispose of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions; and (iv) the discovery of unanticipated liabilities, labor relations difficulties, cybersecurity concerns, compliance issues or other problems in acquired businesses for which we lack contractual protections, insurance or indemnities, or with regard to divested businesses, claims by purchasers to whom we have provided contractual indemnification. Our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance in increasingly competitive markets with acceptable margins. Our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to (i) identify and evolve with emerging technological and broader industry trends in our target end-markets; (ii) develop and maintain competitive products; (iii) defend our market share against an ever-expanding number of competitors including many new and non-traditional competitors; (iv) enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products; (v) develop, manufacture and bring compelling new products to market quickly and cost-effectively; (vi) monitor disruptive technologies and business models; (vii) achieve sufficient return on investment for new products introduced based on capital expenditures and research and development spending; (viii) respond to changes in overall trends related to end-market demand; and (ix) attract, develop and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customers’ needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products. Competitors may also develop after-market services and parts for our products which attract customers and adversely affect our return on investment for new products. The failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors or the failure to address any of the above factors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects. 8 Failure to increase productivity through sustainable operational improvements, as well as an inability to successfully execute repositioning projects or to effectively manage our workforce, may reduce our profitability or adversely impact our businesses. Our profitability and margin growth are dependent upon our ability to drive sustainable improvements. In addition, we seek productivity and cost savings benefits through repositioning actions and projects, such as consolidation of manufacturing facilities, transitions to cost-competitive regions and product line rationalizations. Risks associated with these actions include delays in execution, additional unexpected costs, realization of fewer than estimated productivity improvements and adverse effects on employee morale. We may not realize the full operational or financial benefits we expect, the recognition of these benefits may be delayed and these actions may potentially disrupt our operations. In addition, organizational changes, increased attrition, failure to create and implement a succession plan for key Company positions, not retaining key talent, inability to attract new employees with unique skills, labor relations difficulties, or workforce stoppage could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position and results of operations. As a supplier to the U.S. Government, we are subject to unique risks, such as the right of the U.S. Government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance. U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform consistent with the terms of the applicable contract. Our contracts with the U.S. Government are also subject to government audits that may recommend downward price adjustments and other changes. When appropriate and prudent, we made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in the past and may do so in the future. We are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations. If, as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations (including investigation of violations of certain environmental, employment or export laws), Honeywell or one of its businesses were found to have violated applicable law, then it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings and/or have its export privileges suspended. Our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities. Mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. We continue to incur remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. Various federal, state, local and foreign governments regulate the discharge of materials into the environment, or the use of or communications respecting certain materials in our products, and can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations, and require injunctive relief measures, including installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases, or limiting access of our products to markets, among others. In addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement of policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites, the establishment of stricter toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur additional costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 9 Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations. Global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology (IT) systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company, its products, its customers and/or its third party service providers, including cloud providers. Our customers, including the U.S. government, are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products, and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats and incidents, none of them to date have been material to the Company. We seek to deploy comprehensive measures to deter, prevent, detect, respond to and mitigate these threats, including identity and access controls, data protection, vulnerability assessments, continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems. Despite these efforts, cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include financial loss, reputational damage, litigation with third parties, theft of intellectual property, fines levied by the Federal Trade Commission, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs due to the increasing sophistication and proliferation of threats, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations. The development of technology products and services presents security and safety risks. An increasing number of our products, services and technologies are delivered with Internet of Things (IoT) capabilities and the accompanying interconnected device networks which include sensors, data and advanced computing capabilities. We have developed product software designs which we believe are less susceptible to cyber-attacks, but despite these efforts, if our products and services that include IoT solutions do not work as intended or are compromised, the possible consequences include financial loss, reputational damage, exposure to legal claims or enforcement actions, theft of intellectual property, and diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations. Data privacy, data protection, and information security may require significant resources and presents certain risks. We collect, store, have access to and otherwise process certain confidential or sensitive data, including proprietary business information, personal data or other information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and/or customer-imposed controls. Despite our efforts to protect such data, we may be vulnerable to material security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming errors, or employee errors that could potentially lead to the compromising of such data, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions. In addition, we operate in an environment in which there are different and potentially conflicting data privacy laws in effect in the various U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and we must understand and comply with each law and standard in each of these jurisdictions while ensuring the data is secure. For example, the State of California recently passed legislation granting residents certain new data privacy rights and regulating the security of IoT devices, effective in January 2020; European laws require us to have an approved legal mechanism to transfer personal data out of Europe; the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, which became enforceable in May 2018, superseded prior European Union data protection legislation and imposes more stringent requirements in how we collect and process personal data and provides for significantly greater penalties for noncompliance; and several other countries have passed laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions. Government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business, and violations of data privacy laws can result in fines, reputational damage and civil lawsuits, any of which may adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements. 10 A material disruption of our operations, particularly at our manufacturing facilities or within our information technology infrastructure, could adversely affect our business. Our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to natural disasters, including hurricanes and floods, power outages, fires, explosions, terrorism, equipment failures, sabotage, cyber incidents, adverse weather conditions, labor disputes, critical supply failure, inaccurate downtime forecast, political disruption, and other reasons, which can result in undesirable consequences, including financial losses and damaged relationships with customers. Public health crises, like a regional or global pandemic, could disrupt our supply chain, distribution channels, production facilities, operations and customer demand, which could negatively impact our operations and adversely affect our business. We employ information technology systems and networks to support the business and rely on them to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. Disruptions to our information technology infrastructure from system failures, shutdowns, power outages, telecommunication or utility failures, cybersecurity incidents, and other events, including disruptions at our cloud computing, server, systems and other third party IT service providers, could interfere with our operations, interrupt production and shipments, damage customer and business partner relationships, and negatively impact our reputation. Concentrations of credit and market risk may adversely affect our results of operations. We maintain long-term contract relationships with many of our customers, suppliers, and other counterparties. While we monitor the financial health of these counterparties, we are exposed to credit and market risks to the extent that customers, suppliers, and other counterparties are concentrated in similar industries and geographic regions. Changes in economic conditions in these industries or geographic regions could result in the credit deterioration or insolvency of a significant counterparty, which may lead to concerns about the creditworthiness of other counterparties in the same industry or geography, impacting our ability to renew our long-term contract arrangements or collect amounts due under these arrangements. Legal and Regulatory Risks Our U.S. and non-U.S. tax liabilities are dependent, in part, upon the distribution of income among various jurisdictions in which we operate. Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws, regulations and judicial rulings (or changes in the interpretation thereof), potential taxation of digital services, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures and various other governmental enforcement initiatives. Our tax expense includes estimates of tax reserves and reflects other estimates and assumptions, including assessments of future earnings of the Company which could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets. Changes in tax laws or regulations, including further regulatory developments arising from U.S. tax reform legislation as well as multi-jurisdictional changes enacted in response to the action items provided by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), will increase tax uncertainty and impact our provision for income taxes. 11 Changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations. The sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations including safety, performance and product certification regulations. Within Aerospace, the operating results of Commercial Original Equipment and Commercial Aftermarket may be impacted by, among other things, mandates of the Federal Aviation Administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft. Our Defense and Space business unit may be affected by changes in government procurement regulations. Within Honeywell Building Technologies and Safety and Productivity Solutions, the demand for and cost of providing products, services and solutions can be impacted by fire, security, safety, health care, environmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations. Performance Materials and Technologies’ results of operations can be impacted by environmental standards, regulations, and judicial determinations . Growth in all our businesses within emerging markets may be adversely impacted by the inability to acquire and retain qualified employees where local employment law mandates may be restrictive. Noncompliance with legislation and regulations can result in fines and penalties. Increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in more international, regional and/or federal or other stakeholder requirements or expectations that could mandate more restrictive or expansive standards, such as stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions or more prescriptive reporting of environmental, social, and governance metrics, than the voluntary commitments, that the Company has adopted or require such changes on a more accelerated time frame. There continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. If environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the Company or its products, they could negatively impact the Company’s business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters, government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties. We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employment, employee benefits plans, intellectual property, antitrust, accounting, import and export, and environmental, health and safety matters. Our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities. The incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition. 12 Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None. Item 2. Properties We have approximately 932 locations, of which 242 are manufacturing sites. Our properties and equipment are in good operating condition and are adequate for our present needs. We do not anticipate difficulty in renewing existing leases as they expire or in finding alternative facilities. Item 3. Legal Proceedings We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and claims (some of which involve substantial amounts) arising out of the conduct of our business. See a discussion of environmental, asbestos and other litigation matters in Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The following matter is disclosed solely pursuant to the requirement to disclose certain environmental matters involving potential monetary sanctions in excess of $100,000: In January 2020, Honeywell reached agreement with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) to settle allegations that its Orange, Texas facility had exceeded certain emissions limits in its air permit. When Honeywell discovered these emissions, it took immediate corrective measures to address the issue, and self-reported the emissions to the TCEQ. Under the terms of the settlement, Honeywell will pay a penalty of $152,415 to resolve the matter. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures One of our wholly-owned subsidiaries has a placer claim for and operates a chabazite ore surface mine in Arizona. Information concerning mine safety and other regulatory matters associated with this mine is required by Section 1503(a) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and Item 104 of Regulation S-K and is included in Exhibit 95 to this annual report. 13 Part II. Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Our common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “HON”. Dividend information for Honeywell’s common stock is included in Note 25 Unaudited Quarterly Financial Information of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The number of record holders of our common stock at December 31, 2019 was 43,552. Information regarding securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans is included in Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters under the caption “Equity Compensation Plans.” We purchased 4,325,518 shares of our common stock, par value $1 per share, in the quarter ending December 31, 2019 . On April 29, 2019, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to a total of $10 billion of Honeywell common stock, which included amounts remaining under, and replaced, the previously approved share repurchase program. As of December 31, 2019 , $7.0 billion remained available for additional share repurchases. We expect to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to generally offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. Additionally, we seek to reduce share count via share repurchases as and when attractive opportunities arise. The amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and the level of our operating, financing and other investing activities. The following table summarizes our purchases of Honeywell's common stock for the three months ended December 31, 2019 : Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet be Purchased Under Plans or Programs (Dollars in millions) October 2019 1,326,831 $ 163.68 1,326,831 $ 7,522 November 2019 1,573,877 $ 179.03 1,573,877 $ 7,240 December 2019 1,424,810 $ 176.15 1,424,810 $ 6,989 14 Performance Graph The following graph compares the five-year cumulative total return on our common stock to the total returns on the Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 500 Stock Index and a composite of S&P’s Industrial Conglomerates and Aerospace and Defense indices, on a 55%/45% weighted basis (the Composite Index). The weighting of the components of the Composite Index are based on our segments’ relative contribution to total segment profit. The selection of the Industrial Conglomerates component of the Composite Index reflects the diverse and distinct range of non-aerospace businesses conducted by Honeywell. The annual changes for the five-year period shown in the graph are based on the assumption that $100 had been invested in Honeywell stock and each index on December 31, 2014 and that all dividends were reinvested.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of Honeywell International Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries (“Honeywell” or “the Company”) for the three years ended December 31, 2019 . All references to Notes relate to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. On October 1, 2018, we completed the tax-free spin-off to Honeywell shareowners of our Transportation Systems business, previously part of Aerospace, into a standalone publicly-traded company, Garrett Motion Inc. (“Garrett”). On October 29, 2018, we completed the tax-free spin-off to Honeywell shareowners of our Homes and Global Distribution business, previously part of Home and Building Technologies (renamed Honeywell Building Technologies following the spin-off), into a standalone publicly-traded company, Resideo Technologies, Inc. (“Resideo”). We removed the assets and liabilities associated with Garrett and Resideo from our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the effective dates of the respective spin-offs. We included the results of operations for Garrett and Resideo in our Consolidated Statement of Operations through the effective dates of the respective spin-offs. Total sales and total cost of products and services sold attributable to these spin-offs, impacting segment profit, were $6.6 billion and $4.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2018. A detailed discussion of the prior year 2018 to 2017 year-over-year changes are not included herein and can be found in the Management's Discussion and Analysis section in the 2018 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed February 8, 2019. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY During 2019 , we continued to deliver on our financial commitments and to create long-term shareowner value. Income before taxes grew 1% to $ 7.6 billion despite the spin-offs. The improvement in year over year Income before taxes was attributable to both sales growth as well as operational improvements that increased operating margins. We believe our ability to drive continuous earnings growth over a long history results from consistently identifying and investing in productivity initiatives. We continue to focus on commercial excellence and improvements in our manufacturing and operational processes, including our Integrated Supply Chain and Honeywell Digital transformations, to drive higher sales at better margins. We are careful not to allow the attainment of short-term financial results to imperil the creation of long-term, sustainable shareowner value. We are committed to a strategy to become one of the world’s leading software industrial companies. Our technology investments allow us to introduce new technology solutions in high growth businesses in broad-based, attractive industrial end markets. Each of these end markets is characterized by favorable global mega-trends including energy efficiency, infrastructure investment, urbanization and safety. In 2019 we deployed capital of $7.8 billion, including capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, mergers and acquisitions, and venture investments. BUSINESS OBJECTIVES Our businesses are focused on the following objectives: • Driving profitable growth through delivering innovative products through research and development and technological excellence, and through continued enhancement of our footprint in high growth regions; • Continuing to execute on our strategy to become the premier software-industrial, including the ongoing expansion of Honeywell Forge connected solutions for aircraft, buildings, cybersecurity, plants, and workers and driving a recurring revenue model across the Company; • Expanding margins by optimizing the Company’s cost structure through Supply Chain and Honeywell Digital transformation initiatives, commercial excellence, repositioning, and other manufacturing and operational process improvements; • Executing disciplined, rigorous M&A and integration processes to deliver growth through acquisitions; • Controlling corporate costs, including costs incurred for asbestos and environmental matters, pension and other post-retirement benefits; and • Increasing availability of capital through strong cash flow generation and conversion from effective working capital management and proactively managing debt to enable the Company to smartly deploy capital for strategic acquisitions, dividends, share repurchases and capital expenditures. 17 CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales 2019 2018 2017 Net sales $ 36,709 $ 41,802 $ 40,534 % change compared with prior period (12 )% 3 % Net sales decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 due to the spin-offs. Our 2018 results included $6,550 million of sales related to the Transportation Systems and Homes and Global Distribution businesses. Absent the impact of the spin-offs during 2018, sales grew 4% from $35,252 in 2018 to $36,709 in 2019. The change in net sales is attributable to the following: 2019 Versus 2018 2018 Versus 2017 Volume 3 % 4 % Price 2 % 2 % Foreign Currency Translation (1 )% 1 % Acquisitions/Divestitures (16 )% (4 )% (12 )% 3 % A discussion of net sales by segment can be found in the Review of Business Segments section of this Management’s Discussion and Analysis. The unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation in 2019 compared with 2018 was principally driven by the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against the currencies of the majority of our international markets, primarily the Euro, British Pound and Chinese Renminbi. Cost of Products and Services Sold 2019 2018 2017 Cost of products and services sold $ 24,339 $ 29,046 $ 28,144 % change compared with prior period (16 )% 3 % Gross Margin percentage 33.7 % 30.5 % 30.6 % Cost of products and services sold decreased in 2019 compared to 2018 due to lower direct and indirect material costs of approximately $3,920 million, lower labor costs of approximately $160 million (both driven by the spin-offs of the Transportation Systems and Homes and Global Distribution businesses), and lower repositioning and other charges of approximately $530 million, largely due to lower asbestos and environmental related charges net of the reimbursements. Absent the impact of these items during 2018, cost of products and services sold increased approximately 3%. Gross margin percentage increased in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to higher gross margin in the segments (approximately 1.4 percentage points), with higher Aerospace, Honeywell Building Technologies and Performance Materials and Technologies gross margins, including the favorable impact following the spin-offs, partially offset by lower Safety and Productivity Solutions gross margin. Additionally, gross margin percentage increased due to the lower costs within cost of products and services sold for repositioning and other charges (approximately 1.5 percentage point impact) and pension service costs (approximately 0.2 percentage point impact). 18 Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 2019 2018 2017 Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 5,519 $ 6,051 $ 6,087 % of sales 15.0 % 14.5 % 15.0 % Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to the impact of the spin-offs. In addition, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased due to productivity and the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by labor inflation. Other (Income) Expense 2019 2018 2017 Other (income) expense $ (1,065 ) $ (1,149 ) $ (963 ) Other (income) expense decreased in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily due to lower pension non-service income, partially offset by lower separation costs. Tax Expense 2019 2018 2017 Tax expense $ 1,329 $ 659 $ 5,362 Effective tax rate 17.6 % 8.8 % 77.2 % The effective tax rate for 2019 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily resulting from the impacts of revised guidance related to U.S. Tax Reform and internal restructuring initiatives that resulted in a $281 million reduction of accrued withholding taxes related to unremitted foreign earnings. The effective tax rate for 2018 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily attributable to internal restructuring initiatives that resulted in a reduction of accrued withholding taxes of approximately $1.1 billion related to unremitted foreign earnings. In addition, we recorded a tax benefit of approximately $440 million as a reduction to our 2017 provisional estimate of impacts from what is commonly referred to as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“U.S. Tax Reform”), which was partially offset by $411 million of tax costs associated with the internal restructuring of the Homes and Global Distribution business and the Transportation Systems business in advance of their spin-offs. For further discussion of changes in the effective tax rate, see Note 5 Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Net Income Attributable to Honeywell 2019 2018 2017 Net income attributable to Honeywell $ 6,143 $ 6,765 $ 1,545 Earnings per share of common stock–assuming dilution $ 8.41 $ 8.98 $ 2.00 Earnings per share of common stock–assuming dilution decreased in 2019 compared with 2018 primarily driven by the absence of profit attributable to the spin-offs, higher income tax expense (attributable to a lower income tax benefit related to U.S. Tax Reform and internal restructuring initiatives when compared to the prior year), partially offset by increased operational segment profit and lower repositioning and other charges. 19 Review of Business Segments We globally manage our business operations through four segments: Aerospace, Honeywell Building Technologies, Performance Materials and Technologies, and Safety and Productivity Solutions.

Our 2018 results included $2,622 million of sales related to the spin-off. Absent the impact of the spin-off during 2018, sales grew approximately 9% from $12,871 million to $14,054 million due to growth in organic sales. • Commercial Aviation Original Equipment sales increased 6% (increased 6% organic) primarily due to increased demand from business aviation original equipment manufacturers (OEM). • Commercial Aviation Aftermarket sales increased 7% (increased 7% organic) primarily due to growth in air transport and regional and business aviation. • Defense and Space sales increased 14% (increased 14% organic) primarily driven by growth in U.S. and international defense. Aerospace segment profit increased primarily due to organic sales volume, price, and productivity, net of inflation, partially offset by the divestiture impacts following the spin-off of the Transportation Systems business. Cost of products and services sold decreased primarily due to the spin-off of the Transportation Systems business and productivity, net of inflation, partially offset by higher sales volume. 21 Honeywell Building Technologies 2019 2018 Change 2017 Change Net sales $ 5,717 $ 9,298 (39 )% $ 9,777 (5 )% Cost of products and services sold 3,444 6,066 6,430 Selling, general and administrative and other expenses 1,108 1,624 1,697 Segment profit $ 1,165 $ 1,608 (28 )% $ 1,650 (3 )% Factors Contributing to Year-Over-Year Change 2019 vs. 2018 2018 vs. 2017 Sales Segment Profit Sales Segment Profit Organic 5 % 8 % 3 % 5 % Foreign currency translation (2 )% (2 )% 1 % 1 % Acquisitions, divestitures and other, net (42 )% (34 )% (9 )% (9 )% Total % Change (39 )% (28 )% (5 )% (3 )% 2019 compared with 2018 Honeywell Building Technologies sales decreased due to the impact of the spin-off of the Homes and Global Distribution business. Our 2018 results included $3,928 million of sales related to the spin-off. Absent the impact of the spin-off during 2018, sales grew approximately 6% from $5,370 million to $5,717 million. • Sales in Building Technologies increased 6% (increased 5% organic) due to the organic growth in both Products and Building Solutions, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. Honeywell Building Technologies segment profit decreased primarily due to the divestiture impacts following the spin-off of the Homes and Global Distribution business. This was offset by an increase in organic sales volumes and price, partially offset by inflation. Cost of products and services sold decreased due to the spin-off, partially offset by higher sales volumes. 22 Performance Materials and Technologies 2019 2018 Change 2017 Change Net sales $ 10,834 $ 10,674 1 % $ 10,339 3 % Cost of products and services sold 6,989 6,948 6,764 Selling, general and administrative and other expenses 1,412 1,398 1,369 Segment profit $ 2,433 $ 2,328 5 % $ 2,206 6 % Factors Contributing to Year-Over-Year Change 2019 vs. 2018 2018 vs. 2017 Sales Segment Profit Sales Segment Profit Organic 4 % 6 % 2 % 5 % Foreign currency translation (3 )% (1 )% 1 % 1 % Acquisitions, divestitures and other, net — — — % — % Total % Change 1 % 5 % 3 % 6 % 2019 compared with 2018 Performance Materials and Technologies sales increased primarily due to organic growth, mainly due to volumes, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. • UOP sales increased 2% (increased 3% organic) driven primarily by increases in catalyst sales, project volumes, and licensing, partially offset by lower gas processing volumes and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. • Process Solutions sales increased 3% (increased 6% organic) driven primarily by increases in maintenance and migration services, project volumes, field products, and software sales, partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation. • Advanced Materials sales decreased 2% (flat organic) driven primarily by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and decreased volumes in specialty products, partially offset by growth in fluorine products sales. Performance Materials and Technologies segment profit increased primarily due to productivity, net of inflation, and price, partially offset by higher sales of lower margin products and the impact of foreign currency translation. Cost of products and services sold increased primarily due to higher sales volumes, partially offset by the impact of foreign currency translation and productivity, net of inflation. 23 Safety and Productivity Solutions 2019 2018 Change 2017 Change Net sales $ 6,104 $ 6,337 (4 )% $ 5,639 12 % Cost of products and services sold 4,158 4,205 3,714 Selling, general and administrative and other expenses 1,156 1,100 1,073 Segment profit $ 790 $ 1,032 (23 )% $ 852 21 % Factors Contributing to Year-Over-Year Change 2019 vs. 2018 2018 vs. 2017 Sales Segment Profit Sales Segment Profit Organic (4 )% (23 )% 11 % 20 % Foreign currency translation (2 )% (2 )% 1 % 1 % Acquisitions, divestitures and other, net 2 % 2 % — % — % Total % Change (4 )% (23 )% 12 % 21 % 2019 compared with 2018 Safety and Productivity Solutions sales decreased primarily due to lower organic sales and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by acquisitions. • Sales in Safety decreased 3% (decreased 1% organic) primarily due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation and lower organic sales in Industrial Safety. • Sales in Productivity Solutions decreased 4% (decreased 6% organic) primarily due to lower organic sales in Productivity Products and the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by acquisitions. Safety and Productivity Solutions segment profit decreased as a result of lower sales volumes in Productivity Products, higher sales of lower margin products and the impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by higher productivity, net of inflation, favorable pricing and acquisitions. Cost of products and services sold decreased primarily due to higher productivity, net of inflation, and the impact of foreign currency translation, partially offset by acquisitions. Repositioning Charges See Note 3 Repositioning and Other Charges of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our repositioning actions and related charges incurred in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . Cash spending related to our repositioning actions was $249 million, $285 million and $177 million in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , and was funded through operating cash flows. In 2020 , we expect cash spending for repositioning actions to be approximately $300 million and to be funded through operating cash flows. 24 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES We continue to manage our businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of liquidity. In addition to our available cash and operating cash flows, we maintain additional sources of liquidity, including committed credit lines, short-term debt from the commercial paper market, long-term borrowings, access to the public debt and equity markets and the ability to access non-U.S. cash as a result of the U.S. Tax Reform. We use cash generated through operations to invest in our existing core businesses, acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. Cash Flow Summary Our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, are summarized as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Cash provided by (used for): Operating activities $ 6,897 $ 6,434 $ 5,966 Investing activities (533 ) 1,027 (3,574 ) Financing activities (6,600 ) (5,032 ) (3,516 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 16 (201 ) 340 Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (220 ) $ 2,228 $ (784 ) 2019 compared with 2018 Cash provided by operating activities increased by $ 463 million primarily due to $276 million decrease in net payments for repositioning and other charges, largely due to asbestos and environmental related reimbursement receipts, and a $35 million favorable impact from working capital (favorable inventory and accounts receivable partially offset by accounts payable). Cash used by investing activities increased by $ 1,560 million primarily due to a net $1,762 million increase in investments, primarily short-term marketable securities. Cash used for financing activities increased by $ 1,568 million primarily due to the prior year pre-spin separation funding of $2,622 million net of spin-off cash, an increase in cash dividends paid of $170 million and an increase in net repurchases of common stock of $169 million, partially offset by a decrease in net debt payments of $1,330 million. Liquidity Each of our businesses is focused on increasing operating cash flows through revenue growth, margin expansion and improved working capital turnover. We believe that cash balances and operating cash flow will continue to be our principal source of liquidity. In addition to the available cash and operating cash flows, additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short-term debt from the commercial paper markets, long-term borrowings, and access to the public debt and equity markets. To date, the Company has not experienced any limitations in our ability to access these sources of liquidity. We monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis. Our emphasis is primarily safety of principal and secondarily maximizing yield of those funds. We diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities. A source of liquidity is our ability to access the commercial paper market. Commercial paper notes are sold at a discount or premium and have a maturity of not more than 365 days from date of issuance. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing acquisitions. The weighted average interest rate on short-term borrowings and commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2019 was (0.37%) and as of December 31, 2018 was (0.31%). Our ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related cost of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. Our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debt-rating agencies. As of December 31, 2019 , Standard and Poor’s (S&P), Fitch, and Moody’s have ratings on our long-term debt of A, A and A2 and short-term debt of A-1, F1 and P1. S&P, Fitch and Moody’s have Honeywell’s rating outlook as “stable.” 25 We also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under which we may issue additional debt securities, common stock and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. Net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of existing indebtedness, share repurchases, capital expenditures and acquisitions. See Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures and Note 13 Long-term Debt and Credit Agreements of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of items impacting our liquidity. In 2019 , we repurchased $ 4,400 million of outstanding shares to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans, and to reduce share count when attractive opportunities arise. On April 29, 2019, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to a total of $10.0 billion of Honeywell common stock, of which $7.0 billion remained available as of December 31, 2019 for additional share repurchases. This authorization included amounts remaining under and replaced the previously approved share repurchase program. We expect to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. We will continue to seek to reduce share count via share repurchases when attractive opportunities arise. In addition to our normal operating cash requirements, our principal future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends, strategic acquisitions and debt repayments. Specifically, we expect our primary cash requirements in 2020 to be as follows: • Capital expenditures—we expect to spend approximately $900 million for capital expenditures in 2020 primarily for growth, production and capacity expansion, cost reduction, maintenance, and replacement. • Share repurchases—under our share repurchase program, $7.0 billion is available as of December 31, 2019 for additional share repurchases. We expect to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock-based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. Additionally, we will seek to reduce share count via share repurchases as and when attractive opportunities arise. The amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and our level of operating, financing and other investing activities. • Dividends—we increased our quarterly dividend rate by 10% to $0.90 per share of common stock effective with the fourth quarter 2019 dividend. We intend to continue to pay quarterly dividends in 2020 . We continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit, market position, profit and cash flow contribution in order to identify target investment and acquisition opportunities in order to upgrade our combined portfolio. We identify acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses. We also identify businesses that do not fit into our long-term strategic plan based on their market position, relative profitability or growth potential. These businesses are considered for potential divestiture, restructuring or other repositioning actions subject to regulatory constraints. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs. Our available cash, committed credit lines and access to the public debt and equity markets, provide additional sources of short-term and long-term liquidity to fund current operations, debt maturities, and future investment opportunities. 26 Contractual Obligations Following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and probable liability payments at December 31, 2019 : Total (6)(7) Payments by Period Thereafter 2020 2021- 2022 2023- 2024 Long-term debt, including finance leases (1) $ 12,486 $ 1,376 $ 3,617 $ 2,513 $ 4,980 Interest payments on long-term debt, including finance leases 3,100 327 577 434 1,762 Operating lease liabilities 790 195 290 160 145 Purchase obligations (2) 1,606 782 586 238 — Estimated environmental liability payments (3) 709 222 257 177 53 Asbestos related liability payments (4) 2,357 361 612 438 946 Asbestos insurance recoveries (5) (434 ) (42 ) (108 ) (64 ) (220 ) $ 20,614 $ 3,221 $ 5,831 $ 3,896 $ 7,666 (1) Assumes all long-term debt is outstanding until scheduled maturity. (2) Purchase obligations are entered into with various vendors in the normal course of business and are consistent with our expected requirements. (3) The payment amounts in the table only reflect the environmental liabilities which are probable and reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2019 . (4) These amounts are estimates of asbestos related cash payments for NARCO and Bendix based on our asbestos related liabilities which are probable and reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2019 . See Asbestos Matters in Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (5) These amounts represent our insurance recoveries that are deemed probable for asbestos related liabilities as of December 31, 2019 . See Asbestos Matters in Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (6) The table excludes tax liability payments, including those for unrecognized tax benefits. See Note 5 Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (7) The table excludes expected proceeds from the indemnification and reimbursement agreements entered into with Garrett and Resideo. See Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Asbestos Matters Payments, net of insurance recoveries, related to known asbestos matters was $163 million, $216 million and $239 million in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 and is estimated to be approximately $320 million in 2020 . We expect to pay these asbestos matters from operating cash flows. The timing of these payments depends on several factors, including the timing of litigation and settlements of liability claims. Reimbursements from Garrett for payments related to asbestos matters, as defined in the indemnification and reimbursement agreement, was $152 million in 2019 and is expected to be approximately $115 million in 2020 . We received approximately $36 million in January 2020. See Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our asbestos matters and the indemnification and reimbursement agreement entered into with Garrett. 27 Environmental Matters Accruals for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable were $ 213 million, $ 395 million and $ 287 million in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . In addition, in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately $99 million, $95 million and $82 million relating to compliance with environmental regulations. Payments related to known environmental matters was $ 256 million, $ 218 million and $ 212 million in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 and is estimated to be approximately $220 million in 2020 . We expect to pay these environmental matters from operating cash flows. The timing of these payments depends on several factors, including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, execution timeframe of projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreement with other parties. Reimbursements from Resideo for payments related to environmental matters at certain sites, as defined in the indemnification and reimbursement agreement, was $140 million in 2019 and is expected to be $140 million in 2020 . We received approximately $35 million in January 2020. See Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our environmental matters and the indemnification and reimbursement agreement entered into with Resideo. Financial Instruments The following table illustrates the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments based on a hypothetical immediate one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and the potential change in fair value for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments based on a 10% weakening of the U.S. Dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities at December 31, 2019 and 2018 . Face or Notional Amount Carrying Value (1) Fair Value (1) Estimated Increase (Decrease) in Fair Value (2) December 31, 2019 Interest Rate Sensitive Instruments Long-term debt (including current maturities) $ 12,486 $ (12,486 ) $ (13,578 ) $ (677 ) Interest rate swap agreements 3,950 25 25 (72 ) Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitive Instruments Foreign currency exchange contracts (3) 12,746 270 270 (676 ) Cross currency swap agreements 1,200 51 51 (115 ) December 31, 2018 Interest Rate Sensitive Instruments Long-term debt (including current maturities) $ 12,628 $ (12,628 ) $ (13,133 ) $ (654 ) Interest rate swap agreements 2,600 (45 ) (45 ) (83 ) Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitive Instruments Foreign currency exchange contracts (3) 14,995 115 115 (742 ) Cross currency swap agreements 1,200 32 32 (117 ) (1) Asset or (liability) (2) A hypothetical immediate one percentage point decrease in interest rates across all maturities and a potential change in fair value of foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments based on a 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities will result in a change in fair value approximately equal to the inverse of the amount disclosed in the table. (3) Changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts are offset by changes in the fair value, cash flows, or net investments of underlying hedged foreign currency transactions or foreign operations. See Note 15 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on the agreements. 28 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Many estimates and assumptions involved in the application of accounting principles have a material impact on reported financial condition and operating performance and on the comparability of such reported information over different reporting periods. Critical accounting estimates or assumptions are those where the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change, and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. We consider the estimates and assumptions discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Contingent Liabilities —We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and claims (some of which involve substantial dollar amounts) that arise out of the conduct of our global business operations or those of previously owned entities, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, legal and environmental, health and safety matters. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on a thorough analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters, the outcome of negotiations, the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claims, and the impact of evidentiary requirements. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to new developments (including new discovery of facts, changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases through the judicial system), changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy. See Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of management’s judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of our environmental and asbestos liabilities which represent our most significant contingencies. Asbestos Related Liabilities and Insurance Recoveries —In connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. In assessing the probability of insurance recovery, we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers. While the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. Projecting future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded. Given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections, we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries considering any changes to the projected liability, our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries. Our involvement in asbestos related personal injury actions relates to two predecessor companies. Regarding North American Refractories Company (“NARCO”) asbestos related claims, we accrue for pending claims based on terms and conditions in agreements with NARCO, its former parent company, and certain asbestos claimants, and an estimate of the unsettled claims pending as of the time NARCO filed for bankruptcy protection. We also accrue for the estimated value of future NARCO asbestos related claims expected to be asserted against the NARCO Trust. The estimate of future NARCO claims was prepared in 2002, in the same year NARCO filed for bankruptcy protection, using NARCO tort system litigation experience based on a commonly accepted methodology used by numerous bankruptcy courts addressing 524(g) trusts. Accordingly, the estimated value of future NARCO asbestos claims was prepared before there was data on claims filings and payment rates in the NARCO Trust under the Trust Distribution Procedures and prepared when the stay of all NARCO asbestos claims was in effect (which remained in effect until NARCO emerged from Bankruptcy protection). Some critical assumptions underlying this commonly accepted methodology included claims filing rates, disease criteria and payment values contained in the Trust Distribution Procedures, estimated approval rates of claims submitted to the NARCO Trust and epidemiological studies estimating disease instances. This estimate resulted in a range of estimated liability of $743 million to $961 million . We believe that no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount and accordingly, we have recorded the minimum amount in the range. Given the Trust’s lack of sufficiently reliable claims data since NARCO emerged from bankruptcy protection, it is not yet possible to update our estimated future claim costs based on actual NARCO Trust experience. When sufficiently reliable claims data exists, we will update our estimate of the NARCO Trust Liability and it is possible that a material change may need to be recognized. Regarding Bendix Friction Materials (“Bendix”) asbestos related claims, we accrued for the estimated value of pending claims using average resolution values for the previous 29 five years. We also accrued for the estimated value of future claims related to Bendix over the full term of epidemiological projections through 2059 based on historic and anticipated claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and average resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. See Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of management’s judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of our asbestos-related liabilities and related insurance recoveries. Reimbursement Receivables —In conjunction with the Garrett and Resideo spin-offs, the Company entered into reimbursement agreements under which Honeywell receives cash payments as reimbursement primarily for asbestos related liability payments related to the Bendix business in the U.S. (Garrett) and net spending for environmental matters at certain sites as defined in the agreement (Resideo). Accordingly, the Company has recorded a receivable based on estimates in the underlying reimbursable Honeywell spend, and we monitor the recoverability of such receivable, which is subject to terms of applicable credit agreements and general ability to pay. See Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the recognition and measurement of our reimbursement receivables. Defined Benefit Pension Plans —We sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. For financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension (income) expense is calculated annually based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets could materially affect the annual pension (income) expense amount. Annual pension (income) expense is comprised of service and interest cost, assumed return on plan assets, prior service amortization (Pension Ongoing (Income) Expense) and a potential mark-to-market adjustment (MTM Adjustment). The key assumptions used in developing our 2019 , 2018 and 2017 net periodic pension (income) expense for our U.S. plans included the following: 2019 2018 2017 Discount Rate: Projected benefit obligation 4.35 % 3.68 % 4.20 % Service cost 4.47 % 3.77 % 4.42 % Interest cost 3.94 % 3.27 % 3.49 % Assets: Expected rate of return 6.75 % 7.75 % 7.75 % Actual rate of return 21.2 % (1.8 )% 20.5 % Actual 10 year average annual compounded rate of return 11.1 % 11.0 % 7.4 % The MTM Adjustment represents the recognition of net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans’ projected benefit obligation (the corridor). Net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the various assumptions used to value our pension plans or when assumptions change. The primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses are changes in the discount rate used to value pension obligations as of the measurement date each year and the difference between expected and actual returns on plan assets. The mark-to-market accounting method results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast MTM Adjustments. MTM charges were $123 million, $37 million and $87 million in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . We determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets utilizing historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with our expectations of future market conditions and asset mix considerations (see Note 21 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the actual various asset classes and targeted asset allocation percentages for our pension plans). We plan to use an expected rate of return on plan assets of 6.15% for 2020 down from 6.75% for 2019 reflecting a decline in interest rates and additional re-balancing of assets to more fixed income. The discount rate reflects the market rate on December 31 (measurement date) for high-quality fixed-income investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations and is subject to change each year. The discount rate can be volatile from year to year as it is determined based upon prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date. We used a 3.22% discount rate to determine benefit obligations as of December 31, 2019 , reflecting a decrease in the market interest rate environment since the prior year-end. 30 In addition to the potential for MTM Adjustments, changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events also affects future pension ongoing (income) expense. The following table highlights the sensitivity of our U.S. pension obligations and ongoing (income) expense to changes in these assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant. These estimates exclude any potential MTM Adjustment: Change in Assumption Impact on 2020 Pension Ongoing Expense Impact on PBO 0.25 percentage point decrease in discount rate Decrease $26 million Increase $480 million 0.25 percentage point increase in discount rate Increase $25 million Decrease $470 million 0.25 percentage point decrease in expected rate of return on assets Increase $46 million — 0.25 percentage point increase in expected rate of return on assets Decrease $46 million — Pension ongoing income for our world-wide pension plans is expected to be approximately $786 million in 2020 compared with pension ongoing income of $ 592 million in 2019 . The expected increase in pension income is primarily due to lower interest cost from a decrease in discount rates in our U.S. and UK plans, and higher expected return on plan assets (lower rate of return on a higher asset base). Also, if required, an MTM Adjustment will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020 in accordance with our pension accounting method as previously described. It is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be a MTM Adjustment in 2020 , and if one is required, what the magnitude of such adjustment will be. MTM Adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond the control of the Company such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets. Finite-Lived Intangible Assets —The determination of useful lives (for depreciation/amortization purposes) and whether or not intangible assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our finite-lived intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a finite-lived intangible asset group may not be fully recoverable. The principal factors in considering when to perform an impairment review are as follows: • Significant under-performance (i.e., declines in sales, earnings or cash flows) of a business or product line in relation to expectations; • Annual operating plans or strategic plan outlook that indicate an unfavorable trend in operating performance of a business or product line; • Significant negative industry or economic trends; or • Significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. Once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary, recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. The impairment is then measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset grouping and its fair value. We endeavor to utilize the best information available to measure fair value, which is usually either market prices (if available), level 1 or level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, or an estimate of the future discounted cash flow, level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The key estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include assumptions as to expected industry and business growth rates, sales volume, selling prices and costs, cash flows, and the discount rate selected. These estimates are subject to changes in the economic environment, including market interest rates and expected volatility. Management believes the estimates of future cash flows and fair values are reasonable; however, changes in estimates due to variance from assumptions could materially affect the valuations. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Impairment Testing —Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual, or more frequent if necessary, impairment testing. In testing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair value is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts, including strategic and annual operating plans, adjusted for terminal value assumptions. These impairment tests involve the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. To address this uncertainty, we perform sensitivity analysis on key estimates and assumptions. 31 Income Taxes —On a recurring basis, we assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering all available positive and negative evidence, such as past operating results, projections of future taxable income, enacted tax law changes and the feasibility and impact of tax planning initiatives. Our projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume, pricing and costs, as well as the timing and amount of reversals of taxable temporary differences. We recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities including resolution of any related appeals and litigation. We assess our income tax positions based upon our evaluation of the facts, circumstances and information available at the reporting date. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. For those income tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained, no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements. For further discussion of additional income tax policies, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5 Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Sales Recognition on Long-Term Contracts —We recognize sales for long-term contracts with performance obligations satisfied over time using either an input or output method. We recognize revenue over time as we perform on these contracts based on the continuous transfer of control to the customer. With control transferring over time, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. We generally use the cost-to-cost input method of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as we incur costs. Under the cost-to-cost method, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the proportion of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of our performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion requires judgment. Contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). Cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends and other economic projections. Significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. Revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances. Impacts from changes in estimates of net sales and cost of sales are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis, which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a performance obligation’s percentage of completion. Anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recognized when such losses become evident. We maintain financial controls over the customer qualification, contract pricing and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Accounting Principles —The financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The following is a description of Honeywell’s significant accounting policies. Principles of Consolidation —The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Honeywell International Inc. and all of its subsidiaries and entities in which a controlling interest is maintained. Our consolidation policy requires equity investments that we exercise significant influence over but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investee’s activities to be accounted for using the equity method. Investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which we do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. Property, Plant and Equipment —Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including any asset retirement obligations, less accumulated depreciation. For financial reporting, the straight-line method of depreciation is used over the estimated useful lives of 10 to 50 years for buildings and improvements and 2 to 16 years for machinery and equipment. Recognition of the fair value of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets is required when there is a legal obligation to incur such costs. Upon initial recognition of a liability, the cost is capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the corresponding asset’s useful life. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets —Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment testing annually as of March 31, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. This testing compares carrying values to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of March 31, 2019 and determined that there was no impairment as of that date. Other Intangible Assets with Determinable Lives —Other intangible assets with determinable lives consist of customer lists, technology, patents and trademarks and other intangibles and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 2 to 24 years. Sales Recognition —Product and service sales are recognized when or as the Company transfers control of the promised products or services to its customers. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. Service sales, principally representing repair, maintenance and engineering activities are recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered. Sales under long-term contracts with performance obligations satisfied over time are recognized using either an input or output method. We recognize revenue over time as we perform on these contracts because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer. With control transferring over time, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. We generally use the cost-to-cost input method of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as we incur costs. Under the cost-to-cost method, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the proportion of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. We review our cost estimates on significant contracts on a periodic basis, or when circumstances change and warrant a modification to a previous estimate. Cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends and other economic projections. Significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. Provisions for anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recorded in full when such losses become evident, to the extent required. The customer funding for costs incurred for nonrecurring engineering and development activities of our products under agreements with commercial customers is deferred and subsequently recognized as revenue as products are delivered to the customers. Additionally, expenses incurred, up to the customer agreed funded amount, are deferred as an asset and recognized as cost of sales when products are delivered to the customer. The deferred customer funding and costs result in recognition of deferred costs (asset) and deferred revenue (liability) on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Capitalized contract fulfillment costs were approximately $1 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. The amounts recognized as cost of sales were approximately $0.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. 38 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Revenues for our mechanical service programs are recognized as performance obligations are satisfied over time, with recognition reflecting a series of distinct services using the output method. The terms of a contract or the historical business practice can give rise to variable consideration due to, but not limited to, cash-based incentives, rebates, performance awards, or credits. We estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount we will receive from customers. We include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized for such transaction will not occur, or when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Our estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us. For the year ended 2017 , prior to the adoption of the revenue recognition standard (see Note 7 Revenue Recognition and Contracts with Customers), product and service sales were recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement existed, product delivery had occurred or services had been rendered, pricing was fixed or determinable, and collection was reasonably assured. Service sales, principally representing repair, maintenance and engineering activities were recognized over the contractual period or as services were rendered. Sales under long-term contracts were recorded on a percentage-of-completion method measured on the cost-to-cost basis for engineering-type contracts and the units-of-delivery basis for production-type contracts. Provisions for anticipated losses on long-term contracts were recorded in full when such losses became evident. Revenues from contracts with multiple element arrangements were recognized as each element was earned based on the relative fair value of each element provided the delivered elements had value to customers on a standalone basis. Amounts allocated to each element were based on its objectively determined fair value, such as the sales price for the product or service when it was sold separately or competitor prices for similar products or services. Environmental —The Company accrues costs related to environmental matters when it is probable that we have incurred a liability related to a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated. For additional information, see Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies. Asbestos Related Liabilities and Insurance Recoveries —The Company recognizes a liability for any asbestos related contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. In connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. For additional information, see Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies. Reimbursement Receivables —In conjunction with the Garrett Motion Inc. (“Garrett”) and Resideo Technologies, Inc. (“Resideo”) spin-offs, the Company entered into reimbursement agreements under which Honeywell receives cash payments as reimbursement primarily for asbestos related liability payments related to the Bendix business in the U.S. (Garrett) and net spending for environmental matters at certain sites as defined in the agreement (Resideo). Accordingly, the Company has recorded a receivable based on estimates in the underlying reimbursable Honeywell spend, and we monitor the recoverability of such receivable, which is subject to terms of applicable credit agreements and general ability to pay. For additional information, see Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies. Aerospace Sales Incentives —The Company provides sales incentives to commercial aircraft manufacturers and airlines in connection with their selection of its aircraft equipment, predominately wheel and braking system hardware, avionics, and auxiliary power units, for installation on commercial aircraft. These incentives consist of free or deeply discounted products, credits for future purchases of product or upfront cash payments. These costs are generally recognized in the period incurred as cost of products sold or as a reduction to relevant sales, as appropriate. Research and Development —Research and development costs for company-sponsored research and development projects are expensed as incurred. Such costs are included in cost of products and services sold and were $ 1,556 million , $ 1,809 million and $ 1,835 million in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . Customer-sponsored research and development activities under contracts with customers are included as a contract cost and included in cost of products and services sold when revenue from such contracts is recognized. Such customer-sponsored research and development activities amounted to an additional $ 1,079 million, $ 1,069 million and $ 876 million in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . 39 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Stock-Based Compensation Plans —The principal awards issued under our stock-based compensation plans, which are described in Note 19 Stock-Based Compensation Plans, are non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units. The cost for such awards is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods (generally the vesting period of the equity award) and is included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant to recognize expense for those awards that are expected to vest and are based on our historical forfeiture rates. Pension Benefits —The Company presents net periodic pensions costs by disaggregating the service cost component of net benefit costs and reports those costs in the same line item or items in the Consolidated Statement of Operations as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. The other non-service components of net benefit costs are required to be presented separately from the service cost component. The Company records the service cost component of Pension ongoing (income) expense in Costs of products and services sold and Selling, general and administrative expenses. The remaining components of net benefit costs within Pension ongoing (income) expense, primarily interest costs and assumed return on plan assets, are recorded in Other (income) expense. We recognize net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans’ projected benefit obligation (the corridor) annually in the fourth quarter each year (MTM Adjustment). The MTM Adjustment is also reported in Other (income) expense. Foreign Currency Translation —Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside the United States with a functional currency other than U.S. Dollars are translated into U.S. Dollars using year-end exchange rates. Sales, costs and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the year. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments, inventories and property, plant and equipment, including related expenses, are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect on the date the assets were acquired, while monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at year-end exchange rates. Remeasurement adjustments for these subsidiaries are included in earnings. Derivative Financial Instruments —The Company reduces our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through our normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments are used to manage risk and are not used for trading or other speculative purposes. We do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting must be designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception of the contract. Accordingly, changes in fair value of the derivative contract must be highly correlated with changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item at inception of the hedge and over the life of the hedge contract. All derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. For derivatives designated as hedges of the fair value of assets or liabilities, the changes in fair values of both the derivatives and the hedged items are recorded in current earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the changes in fair value of the derivatives are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged items impact earnings. Cash flows of such derivative financial instruments are classified consistent with the underlying hedged item. We have elected to exclude the time value of the derivatives (i.e., the forward points) from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize the initial value of the excluded component in earnings using the amortization approach. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a net investment hedge, the gain or loss is reported as a component of Other comprehensive income (loss) and recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The gain or loss will be subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. 40 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Income Taxes —Significant judgment is required in evaluating tax positions. We establish reserves for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum recognition threshold. The approach for evaluating certain and uncertain tax positions is defined by the authoritative guidance which determines when a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are examined by various federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a change in estimate become known. For discussion of the impacts from what is commonly referred to as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“U.S Tax Reform”), see Note 5 Income Taxes. Cash and cash equivalents —Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly liquid investments having an original maturity of three months or less. Earnings Per Share —Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and all dilutive potential common shares outstanding. Reclassifications —Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Leases —At the inception of a contract, the Company assesses whether the contract is, or contains, a lease. The assessment is based on (1) whether the contract involves the use of a distinct identified asset, (2) whether the Company obtains the right to substantially all the economic benefit from the use of the asset throughout the period, and (3) whether the Company has the right to direct the use of the asset. All significant lease arrangements are generally recognized at lease commencement. Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement. An ROU asset and corresponding lease liability are not recorded for leases with an initial term of 12 months or less (short term leases), and we recognize lease expense for these leases as incurred over the lease term. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset during the reasonably certain lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Lease payments may be fixed or variable, however, only fixed payments or in-substance fixed payments are included in determining the lease liability. Variable lease payments are recognized in operating expenses in the period in which the obligation for those payments are incurred. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments related to initial direct cost and prepayments and excludes lease incentives. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. The Company primarily uses our incremental borrowing rate, which is based on the information available at the lease commencement date, in determining the present value of the lease payments. In determining the borrowing rate, we consider the lease term, secured incremental borrowing rate, and for leases denominated in a currency different than U.S. dollar, the collateralized borrowing rate in the foreign currency using the U.S. dollar and foreign currency swap spread, when availab le. Recent Accounting Pronouncements —The Company considers the applicability and impact of all Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows (consolidated financial statements). In December 2019, the FASB issued accounting standard update to simplify the accounting for income taxes. The standard’s amendments include changes in various subtopics of accounting for income taxes including, but not limited to, accounting for “hybrid” tax regimes, tax basis step-up in goodwill obtained in a transaction that is not a business combination, intraperiod tax allocation exception to incremental approach, ownership changes in investments, interim-period accounting for enacted changes in tax law, and year-to date loss limitation in interim-period tax accounting. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020 with early adoption permitted, including the 41 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) interim periods within those years. We are currently evaluating impacts of these amendments on our Consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and related notes to the Financial Statements. In February 2018, the FASB issued guidance that allows for an entity to elect to reclassify the income tax effects on items resulting from what is commonly referred to as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""U.S. Tax Reform"") from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted, including interim periods within those years. The Company has elected to not reclassify the stranded income tax effects of U.S. Tax Reform from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. In June 2016, the FASB issued accounting standard that requires companies to utilize an impairment model (current expected credit loss, or CECL) for most financial assets measured at amortized cost and certain other financial instruments, which include, but are not limited to, trade and other receivables. This accounting standard will replace the incurred loss model under current GAAP with a model that reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of reasonable and supportable information to estimate those losses. Effective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted this standard. The adoption of this standard does not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. Note 2. Acquisitions and Divestitures During 2019 , there were no significant acquisitions individually or in aggregate. During 2018 , the Company acquired businesses for an aggregate cost (net of cash and debt assumed) of approximately $ 535 million , mainly due to the November 2018 acquisition of Transnorm , a global leader in high-performance conveyor and warehouse solutions, including approximately $ 380 million allocated to goodwill. Transnorm is part of Safety and Productivity Solutions. The goodwill is non-deductible for tax purposes. During 2017 , there were no significant acquisitions individually or in the aggregate. On October 1, 2018 , the Company completed the tax-free spin-off to Honeywell shareowners of its Transportation Systems business, part of Aerospace, into a standalone publicly-traded company, Garrett Motion Inc. (“Garrett”). On October 29, 2018 , the Company completed the tax-free spin-off to Honeywell shareowners of its Homes and Global Distribution business, part of Home and Building Technologies (renamed Honeywell Building Technologies following the spin-off), into a standalone publicly-traded company, Resideo Technologies, Inc. (“Resideo”). The assets of approximately $ 5.5 billion , including approximately $ 2.8 billion of goodwill and net of recorded receivables, and liabilities of approximately $ 7.2 billion associated with spin-off entities have been removed through Retained Earnings from the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the effective date of the spin-off. The results of operations and cash flows are included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows through the effective date of the spin-off. The Income before taxes attributable to the spin-off businesses were $ 0.4 billion and $ 0.5 billion for 2018 and 2017 . Honeywell shareowners of record as of the close of business on October 16, 2018 received one share of Resideo common stock for every 6 shares of Honeywell common stock. Immediately prior to the effective date of the spin-off, Resideo incurred debt of $ 1.2 billion to make a cash distribution to the Company. Honeywell shareowners of record as of the close of business on September 18, 2018 received one share of Garrett common stock for every 10 shares of Honeywell common stock. Immediately prior to the effective date of the spin-off, Garrett incurred debt of $ 1.6 billion to make a cash distribution to the Company. In 2018 in connection with the spin-off, the Company entered into certain agreements with Resideo and Garrett to affect our legal and structural separation, including transition services agreements to provide certain administrative and other services for a limited time, and tax matters and indemnification and reimbursement agreements. As of the end of 2019 , most of those agreements are still in effect. 42 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

The workforce reductions related to costs savings actions taken in connection with our productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives and to site transitions, mainly in Honeywell Building Technologies, as we transition manufacturing to more cost-effective locations. The repositioning charge included asset impairments of $ 95 million largely related to a write down in connection with assets held for sale. The repositioning charge included exit costs of $ 83 million primarily related to current period exit costs incurred for previously approved repositioning projects, termination fees associated with the early cancellation of supply agreements for certain raw materials in Performance Materials and Technologies and Honeywell Building Technologies and for closure obligations associated with site transitions. In 2018 , the Company recognized repositioning charges totaling $ 530 million including severance costs of $ 289 million related to workforce reductions of 6,486 manufacturing and administrative positions across our segments. The workforce reductions were primarily related to planned site closures, mainly in Safety and Productivity Solutions, Performance Materials and Technologies and Honeywell Building Technologies, as we transition manufacturing sites to more cost-effective locations. The workforce reductions were also related to our productivity and ongoing functional 43 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) transformation initiatives. The repositioning charge included asset impairments of $ 162 million mainly related to manufacturing plant and equipment associated with planned site closures. Asset impairments also included the write-down of a legacy property in Corporate in connection with its planned disposition and the write-off of certain capitalized assets in Corporate. The repositioning charge included exit costs of $ 79 million primarily related to a termination fee associated with the early cancellation of a supply agreement for certain raw materials in Performance Materials and Technologies and for closure obligations associated with planned site closures. In 2017 , the Company recognized repositioning charges totaling $ 507 million including severance costs of $ 305 million related to workforce reductions of 7,096 manufacturing and administrative positions across its segments. The workforce reductions were primarily related to cost savings actions taken in connection with our productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives and with site transitions, in each of our segments, to more cost-effective locations. The repositioning charge included asset impairments of $ 142 million principally in our Corporate segment related to the write-down of legacy properties and certain equipment in connection with their planned disposition and the write-down of a research and development facility in connection with a planned exit from such facility. The repositioning charge included exit costs of $ 60 million principally for closure obligations associated with site transitions in each of our segments and for lease exit obligations in our Corporate segment.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Years Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 The U.S. federal statutory income tax rate is reconciled to our effective income tax rate as follows: U.S. federal statutory income tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 35.0 % Taxes on non-U.S. earnings (1)(2) ( 0.5 ) 0.2 ( 12.8 ) U.S. state income taxes (1) 1.1 1.6 1.4 Reserves for tax contingencies 2.0 0.3 1.6 Employee share-based payments ( 1.2 ) ( 0.7 ) ( 2.9 ) U.S. Tax Reform ( 3.6 ) ( 5.8 ) 56.0 Reduction of taxes on unremitted earnings — ( 14.2 ) — Separation tax costs — 5.5 — All other items—net ( 1.2 ) 0.9 ( 1.1 ) 17.6 % 8.8 % 77.2 % (1) Net of changes in valuation allowance (2) Includes U.S. taxes on non-U.S. earnings The effective tax rate increased by 8.8 percentage points in 2019 compared to 2018 . The increase was primarily attributable to a lower income tax benefit resulting from revised guidance related to U.S. Tax Reform and internal restructuring initiatives that resulted in a $ 281 million reduction of accrued withholding taxes related to unremitted foreign earnings when compared to the prior year. The Company’s non-U.S. effective tax rate was 26.1 % , an increase of approximately 22.0 percentage points compared to 2018 . The increase in the foreign effective tax rate was primarily attributable to a lower income tax benefit related to the Company’s internal restructuring initiatives when compared to the prior year. The effective tax rate decreased by 68.4 percentage points in 2018 compared to 2017 . The decrease was primarily attributable to internal restructuring initiatives that resulted in a reduction of accrued withholding taxes of approximately $ 1.1 billion related to unremitted foreign earnings. In addition, we recorded a tax benefit of approximately $ 440 million as a reduction to our 2017 provisional estimate of impacts from U.S. Tax Reform, which was partially offset by $ 411 million of tax costs associated with the internal restructuring of the Homes and Global Distribution business and Transportation Systems business in advance of their spin-offs. The Company’s non-U.S. effective tax rate was 4.1 % , a decrease of approximately 67.3 percentage points compared to 2017 . The year over year decrease in the foreign effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the impact of the Company’s internal restructuring initiatives and the reduction of accrued withholding taxes on unremitted foreign earnings, partially offset by the spin-off transactions. 46 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Deferred tax assets (liabilities) The tax effects of temporary differences and tax carryforwards which give rise to future income tax benefits and payables are as follows: Deferred tax assets: December 31, 2019 2018 Postretirement benefits other than pensions $ 111 $ 120 Asbestos and environmental 531 589 Employee compensation and benefits 205 262 Other accruals and reserves 279 336 Net operating and capital losses 652 688 Tax credit carryforwards 246 154 Gross deferred tax assets 2,024 2,149 Valuation allowance ( 656 ) ( 689 ) Total deferred tax assets $ 1,368 $ 1,460 Deferred tax liabilities: Pension $ ( 469 ) $ ( 40 ) Property, plant and equipment ( 469 ) ( 422 ) Intangibles ( 1,296 ) ( 1,553 ) Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries ( 419 ) ( 616 ) Other asset basis differences ( 136 ) ( 110 ) Other ( 163 ) ( 50 ) Total deferred tax liabilities ( 2,952 ) ( 2,791 ) Net deferred tax liability $ ( 1,584 ) $ ( 1,331 ) The Company's gross deferred tax assets include $ 767 million related to non-U.S. operations comprised principally of net operating losses, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards (mainly in Canada, France, Germany, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom) and deductible temporary differences. We maintain a valuation allowance of $ 653 million against a portion of the non-U.S. gross deferred tax assets. The change in the valuation allowance resulted in a decrease of $ 23 million and increases of $ 57 million and $ 4 million to income tax expense in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . In the event we determine that we will not be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future, we will reduce such amounts through an increase to income tax expense in the period such determination is made. Conversely, if we determine that we will be able to realize net deferred tax assets in excess of the carrying amounts, we will decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a reduction to income tax expense in the period that such determination is made. As of December 31, 2019 , the Company recorded a $ 419 million deferred tax liability on all of our unremitted foreign earnings based on estimated earnings and profits of approximately $ 16.7 billion as of the balance sheet date. As of December 31, 2019 , the Company's net operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards were as follows: Jurisdiction Expiration Period Net Operating and Capital Loss Carryforwards Tax Credit Carryforwards U.S. Federal 2039 $ 16 $ 89 U.S. State 2039 389 20 Non-U.S. 2039 277 142 Non-U.S. Indefinite 2,324 — $ 3,006 $ 251 47 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Many jurisdictions impose limitations on the timing and utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. In those instances, whereby there is an expected permanent limitation on the utilization of the net operating loss or tax credit carryforward, the deferred tax asset and amount of the carryforward have been reduced. 2019 2018 2017 Change in unrecognized tax benefits: Balance at beginning of year $ 1,089 $ 947 $ 877 Gross increases related to current period tax positions 51 370 94 Gross increases related to prior periods tax positions 83 82 153 Gross decreases related to prior periods tax positions ( 34 ) ( 201 ) ( 91 ) Decrease related to resolutions of audits with tax authorities ( 3 ) ( 40 ) ( 76 ) Expiration of the statute of limitations for the assessment of taxes ( 13 ) ( 50 ) ( 54 ) Foreign currency translation ( 9 ) ( 19 ) 44 Balance at end of year $ 1,164 $ 1,089 $ 947 As of December 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 there were $ 1,164 million , $ 1,089 million , and $ 947 million of unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would be recorded as a component of Tax expense. The following table summarizes tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions as of December 31, 2019 : Jurisdiction Open Tax Years Based on Originally Filed Returns Examination in progress Examination not yet initiated U.S. Federal 2015 - 2016 2017-2019 U.S. State 2011 - 2017 2012-2018 Australia N/A 2016-2019 Canada (1) 2015-2017 2018-2019 China 2009-2018 2019 France N/A 2017-2019 Germany (1) 2008-2017 2018-2019 India 1999-2017 2018-2019 Italy 2012-2017 2018-2019 Netherlands 2016-2017 2018-2019 Switzerland (1) 2012-2018 2019 United Kingdom 2013-2017 2018-2019 (1) Includes provincial or similar local jurisdictions, as applicable. Based on the outcome of these examinations, or as a result of the expiration of statute of limitations for specific jurisdictions, it is reasonably possible that certain unrecognized tax benefits for tax positions taken on previously filed tax returns will materially change from those recorded as liabilities in our financial statements. In addition, the outcome of these examinations may impact the valuation of certain deferred tax assets (such as net operating losses) in future periods. Unrecognized tax benefits for examinations in progress were $ 413 million , $ 304 million and $ 487 million , as of December 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 . Estimated interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes are classified as a component of Tax expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and totaled $ 73 million , $ 45 million and $ 28 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 . Accrued interest and penalties were $ 487 million , $ 426 million and $ 423 million , as of December 31, 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 . 48 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) U.S. Tax Reform During the quarter ending December 31, 2018, the Company completed the accounting for the tax effects of U.S. Tax Reform which amounted to a total tax charge of approximately $ 3.5 billion , most of which was recorded as a provisional estimate at the end of 2017. During 2018, we reduced our provisional estimate by approximately $ 440 million as a reduction to Tax expense. Corporate Tax Rate Change —During the years 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded a total tax benefit of approximately $ 190 million due to the decrease in the corporate statutory tax rate from 35 % to 21 % . This includes a measurement period adjustment of approximately $ 90 million recorded during 2018 as a reduction to Tax expense. The change in the provisional estimate primarily relates to information contained in tax returns that were filed during the quarter ending December 31, 2018, some of which require approval from U.S. tax authorities. The tax benefit from the change in tax rates results from the Company’s deferred tax liability position for the excess of its net book value over its tax basis of its U.S. assets and liabilities that will generate future taxable income in excess of book income. This additional taxable income will be subject to tax at a lower corporate tax rate, consequently reducing the Company’s deferred tax liability. Mandatory Transition Tax —During the years 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded a total tax charge of approximately $ 1,950 million due to the imposition of the mandatory transition tax (“MTT”) on the deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings. This includes a measurement period adjustment of approximately $ 50 million recorded during 2018 as an increase to Tax expense. The change in the provisional estimate primarily relates to updated amounts from tax returns that were finalized during 2018, computations based on 2018 testing dates and guidance from the taxing authorities that was received during the year. The Company has elected to pay the MTT liability over a period of eight years. Undistributed Foreign Earnings —During the years 2018 and 2017, the Company recorded a total tax charge of approximately $ 1,700 million due to the Company’s intent to no longer permanently reinvest the historical unremitted earnings of its foreign affiliates that existed as of December 31, 2017. This includes a measurement period adjustment of approximately $ 400 million recorded during 2018 as a reduction to Tax expense. The change in the provisional estimate primarily relates to updated amounts from tax returns that were finalized during 2018, the application of foreign tax credits based on guidance issued during the year and changes to the applicable withholding tax rates in local jurisdictions. The Company also reduced these taxes on unremitted foreign earnings by $ 281 million and $ 1.1 billion in 2019 and 2018, respectively, that were recorded as reductions to Tax expense. Global Intangible Low Taxed Income —U.S. Tax Reform imposes a U.S. tax on global intangible low taxed income (“GILTI”) that is earned by certain foreign affiliates owned by a U.S. shareholder. GILTI is generally intended to impose tax on the earnings of a foreign corporation that are deemed to exceed a certain threshold return relative to the underlying business investment. The Company has made a policy election to treat future taxes related to GILTI as a current period expense in the reporting period in which the tax is incurred. 49 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

For a summary by disaggregated product and services sales for each segment, refer to Note 22 Segment Financial Data. The Company recognizes revenue arising from performance obligations outlined in contracts with its customers that are satisfied at a point in time and over time. The disaggregation of our revenue based off timing of recognition is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2019 2018 Products, transferred point in time 61 % 67 % Products, transferred over time 14 12 Net product sales 75 79 Services, transferred point in time 9 7 Services, transferred over time 16 14 Net service sales 25 21 Net sales 100 % 100 % Contract Balances Progress on satisfying performance obligations under contracts with customers and the related billings and cash collections are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in Accounts receivable - net and Other assets (unbilled receivables (contract assets) and billed receivables) and Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities (customer advances and deposits (contract liabilities)). Unbilled receivables (contract assets) arise when the timing of cash collected from customers differs from the timing of revenue recognition, such as when contract provisions require specific milestones to be met before a customer can be billed. Those assets are recognized when the revenue associated with the contract is recognized prior to billing and derecognized when billed in accordance with the terms of the contract. Contract liabilities are recorded when customers remit contractual cash payments in advance of us satisfying performance obligations under contractual arrangements, including those with performance obligations to be satisfied over a period of time. Contract liabilities are derecognized when revenue is recorded, either when a milestone is met triggering the contractual right to bill or when the performance obligation is satisfied. 52 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Contract balances are classified as assets or liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. The following table summarizes the Company's contract assets and liabilities balances: 2019 2018 Contract assets—January 1 $ 1,548 $ 1,721 Contract assets—December 31 1,602 1,548 Change in contract assets—increase (decrease) $ 54 $ ( 173 ) Contract liabilities—January 1 $ ( 3,378 ) $ ( 2,973 ) Contract liabilities—December 31 ( 3,501 ) ( 3,378 ) Change in contract liabilities—(increase) decrease $ ( 123 ) $ ( 405 ) Net change $ ( 69 ) $ ( 578 ) The net change in 2019 was primarily driven by the receipt of advance payments from customers exceeding recognition of revenue as performance obligations were satisfied prior to billing. The net change in 2018 was primarily driven by the receipt of advance payments from customers exceeding reductions from recognition of revenue as performance obligations were satisfied and related billings. For the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , we recognized revenue of $ 1,543 million and $ 1,166 million that was previously included in the beginning balance of contract liabilities. When contracts are modified to account for changes in contract specifications and requirements, the Company considers whether the modification either creates new or changes the existing enforceable rights and obligations. Contract modifications for goods or services and not distinct from the existing contract, due to the significant integration with the original good or service provided, are accounted for as if they were part of that existing contract. The effect of a contract modification on the transaction price and our measure of progress for the performance obligation to which it relates, is recognized as an adjustment to revenue (either as an increase in or a reduction of revenue) on a cumulative catch-up basis. When the modifications include additional performance obligations that are distinct and at relative stand-alone selling price, they are accounted for as a new contract and performance obligation, which are recognized prospectively. Performance Obligations A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is defined as the unit of account. A contract’s transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. When our contracts with customers require highly complex integration or manufacturing services that are not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts and, therefore, not distinct, then the entire contract is accounted for as a single performance obligation. In situations when our contract includes distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer over time, they are recognized as a series of distinct goods or services. For any contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract’s transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated relative standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. For product sales, each product sold to a customer typically represents a distinct performance obligation. In such cases, the observable standalone sales are used to determine the stand alone selling price. Performance obligations are satisfied as of a point in time or over time. Performance obligations are supported by contracts with customers, providing a framework for the nature of the distinct goods, services or bundle of goods and services. The timing of satisfying the performance obligation is typically indicated by the terms of the contract. 53 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) The following table outlines the Company's remaining performance obligations disaggregated by segment: December 31, 2019 Aerospace $ 11,315 Honeywell Building Technologies 5,515 Performance Materials and Technologies 6,527 Safety and Productivity Solutions 2,255 $ 25,612 Performance obligations recognized as of December 31, 2019 will be satisfied over the course of future periods. Our disclosure of the timing for satisfying the performance obligation is based on the requirements of contracts with customers. However, from time to time, these contracts may be subject to modifications, impacting the timing of satisfying the performance obligations. Performance obligations expected to be satisfied within one year and greater than one year are 57 % and 43 % . The timing of satisfaction of the Company's performance obligations does not significantly vary from the typical timing of payment. Typical payment terms of our fixed-price over time contracts include progress payments based on specified events or milestones, or based on project progress. For some contracts we may be entitled to receive an advance payment. The Company has applied the practical expedient for certain revenue streams to exclude the value of remaining performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected term of one year or less or (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue in proportion to the amount we have the right to invoice for services performed.

Commitments under the 5-Year Credit Agreement can be increased pursuant to the terms of the 5-Year Credit Agreement to an aggregate amount not to exceed $ 4.5 billion . The 5-Year Credit Agreement amends and restates the previously reported $ 4.0 billion amended and restated five-year credit agreement dated as of April 27, 2018 (the ""Prior Agreement""). The 5-Year Credit Agreement has substantially the same material terms and conditions as the Prior Agreement. On April 26, 2019, the Company entered into a $ 1.5 billion 364-Day Credit Agreement with a syndicate of banks. This 364-Day Credit Agreement is maintained for general corporate purposes. There have been no borrowings under any of the credit agreements previously described. Note 14. Leases Adoption Effective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted the new lease accounting standard using the modified retrospective method of applying the new standard at the adoption date. In addition, we elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard. This allowed us to carry forward the historical lease classification. Adoption of this standard resulted in the recording of net operating lease right-of-use (ROU) assets and corresponding operating lease liabilities of $ 0.7 billion. Financial position for reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019 are presented under the new guidance, while prior periods amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with previous guidance. A significant portion of the Company's operating and finance lease portfolio includes corporate offices, research and development facilities, manufacturing sites, information technology (IT) equipment, and automobiles. The majority of our leases have remaining lease terms of 1 year to 20 years, some of which include options to extend the leases for 5 years or more. Operating lease ROU assets are presented within Other assets. The current portion of operating lease liabilities are presented within Accrued liabilities, and the non-current portion of operating lease liabilities are presented within Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Finance lease assets are included in Property, plant and equipment - net, and the finance lease obligations are included in Current maturities of long-term debt, and in Long-term debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. 58 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) A portion of the Company's real estate leases is generally subject to annual changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The changes to the CPI are treated as variable lease payments and recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments was incurred. In addition, a subset of our automobile leases is considered variable. The variable lease payments for such automobiles leases are based on actual mileage incurred at the stated contractual rate and recognized in the period in which the obligation for those payments was incurred.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Note 15. Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures Credit and Market Risk —Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose the Company to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest and currency exchange rates. Our counterparties in derivative transactions are substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience using such derivative instruments. The Company continually monitors the creditworthiness of its customers to which it grants credit terms in the normal course of business. The terms and conditions of our credit sales are designed to mitigate or eliminate concentrations of credit risk with any single customer. Our sales are not materially dependent on a single customer or a small group of customers. Foreign Currency Risk Management —The Company conducts business on a multinational basis in a wide variety of foreign currencies. Our exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries, foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and transactions arising from international trade. Our primary objective is to preserve the U.S. Dollar value of foreign currency denominated cash flows and earnings. We monitor our collective foreign currency exposure and enter into foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts (foreign currency exchange contracts) with third parties, when necessary, to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. The Company has monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Prior to conversion into U.S. dollars, these assets and liabilities are remeasured at spot exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. The effects of changes in spot rates are recognized in earnings and included in other (income) expense. We may purchase or enter into derivative instruments to hedge our foreign currency exposure. We hedge forecasted sales and purchases, which are denominated in non-functional currencies, with foreign currency exchange contracts. Changes in the forecasted non-functional currency cash flows due to movements in exchange rates are substantially offset by changes in the fair value of these foreign currency exchange contracts designated as hedges. Market value gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in earnings when the hedged transaction is recognized. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , we had contracts with notional amounts of $ 12,746 million and $ 14,995 million to exchange foreign currencies, principally the U.S. Dollar, Euro, Canadian Dollar, British Pound, Mexican Peso, Chinese Renminbi, Indian Rupee, Malaysian Ringgit, and Swiss Franc. As of December 31, 2019 , we estimate that approximately $ 52 million of net derivative gains related to our cash flow hedges included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) will be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months. The Company has also designated foreign currency debt and certain derivative contracts as hedges against portions of its net investment in foreign operations during the year ended December 31, 2019 . Gains or losses of the foreign currency debt and derivative contracts designated as a net investment hedge are recorded in the same manner as foreign currency translation adjustments. Interest Rate Risk Management —Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose the Company to market risk related to changes in interest rates. The Company uses a combination of financial instruments, including long-term, medium-term and short-term financing, variable-rate commercial paper, and interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. At December 31, 2019 and 2018 , interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges effectively changed $ 3,950 million and $ 2,600 million of fixed rate debt at 2.87 % and 2.93 % to LIBOR based floating rate debt. Our interest rate swaps mature at various dates through 2029. 61 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Fair Value of Financial Instruments —The accounting guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy. • Level 1-Inputs are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. • Level 2-Inputs are based on observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical or similar assets and liabilities. • Level 3-One or more inputs are unobservable and significant. Financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The following table sets forth the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 : December 31, 2019 2018 Assets: Foreign currency exchange contracts $ 291 $ 119 Available for sale investments 1,523 1,784 Interest rate swap agreements 38 20 Cross currency swap agreements 51 32 Liabilities: Foreign currency exchange contracts $ 21 $ 4 Interest rate swap agreements 13 65 The foreign currency exchange contracts, interest rate swap agreements, and cross currency swap agreements are valued using broker quotations, or market transactions in either the listed or over-the-counter markets. As such, these derivative instruments are classified within level 2. The Company also holds investments in commercial paper, certificates of deposits, and time deposits that are designated as available for sale and are valued using published prices based off observable market data. As such, these investments are classified within level 2. The Company also holds available for sale investments in U.S. government and corporate debt securities valued utilizing published prices based on quoted market pricing, which are classified within level 1. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts and notes receivables, payables, commercial paper (of which $ 3,513 million and $ 3,583 million was Euro denominated as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 ) and short-term borrowings contained in the Consolidated Balance Sheet approximates fair value.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) The Company determined the fair value of the long-term receivables by utilizing transactions in the listed markets for identical or similar assets. As such, the fair value of these receivables is considered level 2. The Company determined the fair value of the long-term debt and related current maturities utilizing transactions in the listed markets for identical or similar liabilities. As such, the fair value of the long-term debt and related current maturities is considered level 2. Interest rate swap agreements are designated as hedge relationships with gains or losses on the derivative recognized in interest and other financial charges offsetting the gains and losses on the underlying debt being hedged. Gains and losses on interest rate swap agreements recognized in earnings were $ 70 million of income, $ 37 million of expense and $ 29 million of expense in the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 . Gains and losses are fully offset by losses and gains on the underlying debt being hedged. The Company economically hedges its exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates principally with forward contracts. These contracts are marked-to-market with the resulting gains and losses recognized in earnings offsetting the gains and losses on the non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities being hedged. We recognized $ 106 million of income, $ 394 million of income, and $ 207 million of expense in Other (income) expense in the years ended December 31, 2019 , 2018 and 2017 .

Stock-Based Compensation Plans The 2016 Stock Incentive Plan of Honeywell International Inc. and its Affiliates (2016 Plan) and 2016 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors of Honeywell International Inc. (2016 Directors Plan) were both approved by the shareowners at the Annual Meeting of Shareowners effective on April 25, 2016. Following approval of both plans, we have not and will not grant any new awards under any previously existing stock-based compensation plans. At December 31, 2019 , there were 37,364,854 , and 866,273 shares of Honeywell common stock available for future grants under terms of the 2016 Plan and 2016 Directors Plan, respectively. Stock Options —The exercise price, term and other conditions applicable to each option granted under the Company's stock plans are generally determined by the Management Development and Compensation Committee of the Board. The exercise price of stock options is set on the grant date and may not be less than the fair market value per share of our stock on that date. The fair value is recognized as an expense over the employee’s requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the award). Options generally vest over a four-year period and expire after ten years. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on our common stock and historical volatility of our common stock. We used a Monte Carlo simulation model to derive an expected term which represents an estimate of the time options are expected to remain outstanding. Such model uses historical data to estimate option exercise activity and post-vest termination behavior. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

Commitments and Contingencies Environmental Matters The Company is subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements relating to the protection of the environment. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of hazardous substances are in accordance with environmental and safety laws and regulations. However, mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we, like other companies engaged in similar businesses, have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. With respect to environmental matters involving site contamination, the Company continually conducts studies, individually or jointly with other potentially responsible parties, to determine the feasibility of various remedial techniques. It is our policy to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters when remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work. The recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical, regulatory or legal information becomes available. Given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws, regulations, enforcement policies, the impact of other potentially responsible 70 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) parties, technology and information related to individual sites, we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of our recorded liabilities. We expect to fund expenditures for these matters from operating cash flow. The timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of factors, including the timing of remedial investigations and feasibility studies, the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties. The following table summarizes information concerning the Company's recorded liabilities for environmental costs: Years Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Beginning of year $ 755 $ 595 $ 511 Accruals for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable 213 395 287 Environmental liability payments ( 256 ) ( 218 ) ( 212 ) Other ( 3 ) ( 17 ) 9 End of year $ 709 $ 755 $ 595 Environmental liabilities are included in the following balance sheet accounts: December 31, 2019 2018 Accrued liabilities $ 222 $ 175 Other liabilities 487 580 $ 709 $ 755 The Company does not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of environmental liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies, litigation or settlements, and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined although they could be material to our consolidated results of operations and operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid. However, considering our past experience and existing reserves, we do not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. In conjunction with the Resideo spin-off, the Company entered into an indemnification and reimbursement agreement with a Resideo subsidiary, pursuant to which Resideo’s subsidiary has an ongoing obligation to make cash payments to Honeywell in amounts equal to 90 percent of Honeywell’s annual net spending for environmental matters at certain sites as defined in the agreement. The amount payable to Honeywell in any given year is subject to a cap of $ 140 million , and the obligation will continue until the earlier of December 31, 2043, or December 31 of the third consecutive year during which the annual payment obligation has been less than $ 25 million . Reimbursements associated with this agreement were $ 140 million and $ 25 million in 2019 and 2018 , respectively and offset operating cash outflows incurred by the Company. As the Company records the accruals for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable related to the sites covered by the indemnification and reimbursement agreement, a corresponding receivable from Resideo for 90 percent of that accrual is also recorded. This receivable amount recorded in 2019 and 2018 , subsequent to the spin-off, was $ 109 million and $ 50 million . As of December 31, 2019 , Other Current Assets and Other Assets includes $ 140 million and $ 445 million representing the short-term and long-term portion of the receivable amount due from Resideo under the indemnification and reimbursement agreement. As of December 31, 2018 , Other Current Assets and Other Assets includes $ 140 million and $ 476 million representing the short-term and long-term portion of the receivable amount due from Resideo under the indemnification and reimbursement agreement.

When the NARCO business was sold, Honeywell’s predecessor entered into a cross-indemnity agreement with NARCO which included an obligation to indemnify the purchaser for asbestos claims. Such claims arise primarily from alleged occupational exposure to asbestos-containing refractory brick and mortar for high-temperature applications. NARCO ceased manufacturing these products in 1980, and the first asbestos claims were filed in the tort system against NARCO in 1983. Claims filings and related costs increased dramatically in the late 1990s through 2001, which led to NARCO filing for bankruptcy in January 2002. Once NARCO filed for bankruptcy, all then current and future NARCO asbestos claims were stayed against both NARCO and Honeywell pending the reorganization of NARCO. 72 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Following the bankruptcy filing, in December 2002 Honeywell recorded a total NARCO asbestos liability of $ 3.2 billion , which was comprised of three components: (i) the estimated liability to settle pre-bankruptcy petition NARCO claims and certain post-petition settlements ( $ 2.2 billion , referred to as “Pre-bankruptcy NARCO Liability”), (ii) the estimated liability related to then unasserted NARCO claims for the period 2004 through 2018 ( $ 950 million , referred to as “NARCO Trust Liability”), and (iii) other NARCO bankruptcy-related obligations totaling $ 73 million . When the NARCO Trust Liability of $ 950 million was established in 2002, the methodology for estimating the potential liability was based primarily on: (a) epidemiological projections of the future incidence of disease for the period 2004 through 2018, a fifteen-year period; (b) historical claims rates in the tort system for the five-year period prior to the bankruptcy filing date; and (c) anticipated NARCO Trust payment values set forth in the then current draft of the NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures. The methodology required estimating, by disease, three critical inputs: (i) likely number of claims to be asserted against the NARCO Trust in the future, (ii) percentage of those claims likely to receive payment, and (iii) payment values. The Company utilized outside asbestos liability valuation specialists to support our preparation of the NARCO Trust Liability estimate, which was based on a commonly accepted methodology used by numerous bankruptcy courts addressing 524(g) trusts. In 2002, when the Company first established its initial liability, NARCO asbestos claims resolution shifted from the tort system to an anticipated NARCO Trust framework, where claims would be processed in accordance with established NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures, including strict medical and exposure criteria for a plaintiff to receive compensation. We believed at the time that the NARCO Trust’s claims filing and resolution experience after the NARCO Trust became operational would be significantly different from pre-bankruptcy tort system experience in light of these more rigorous claims processing requirements in the NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures and Honeywell’s active oversight of claims processing and approval. Given these anticipated differences, we believed that a 15-year time period was the appropriate horizon for establishing a probable and reasonably estimable liability for then unasserted NARCO claims as it represented our best estimate of the time period it would take for the NARCO Trust to be approved by the Bankruptcy Court, become fully operational and generate sufficiently reliable claims data (i.e., a data set which is statistically representative) to enable us to update our NARCO Trust Liability. The NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures were finalized in 2006, and the Company updated its NARCO Trust Liability to reflect the final terms and payment values. The original 15-year period (from 2004 through 2018) for unasserted claims did not change as asbestos claims filings continued to be stayed against both Honeywell and NARCO. The 2006 update resulted in a range of the estimated liability for unasserted claims of $ 743 million to $ 961 million , and we believed that no amount within this range was a better estimate than any other amount. In accordance with ASC 450–Contingencies (“ASC 450”), we recorded the low end of the range of $ 743 million (the “2006 NARCO Trust Liability Estimate”) which resulted in a reduction of $ 207 million in our NARCO Trust Liability. NARCO emerged from bankruptcy on April 30, 2013, at which time a federally authorized 524(g) trust was established for the evaluation and resolution of all existing and future NARCO asbestos claims. Both Honeywell and NARCO are protected by a permanent channeling injunction barring all present and future individual actions in state or federal courts and requiring all asbestos related claims based on exposure to NARCO asbestos-containing products to be made against the NARCO Trust. The NARCO Trust Agreement and the NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures are the principal documents setting forth the structure of the NARCO Trust. These documents establish Honeywell’s evergreen funding obligations. Honeywell is obligated to fund NARCO asbestos claims submitted to the NARCO Trust which qualify for payment under the Trust Distribution Procedures (Annual Contribution Claims), subject to an annual cap of $ 145 million . However, the initial $ 100 million of claims processed through the NARCO Trust (the Initial Claims Amount) will not count against the annual cap and any unused portion of the Initial Claims Amount will roll over to subsequent years until fully utilized. These documents also establish the material operating rules for the NARCO Trust, including Honeywell audit rights and the criteria claimants must meet to have a valid claim paid. These claims payment criteria include providing the NARCO Trust with adequate medical evidence of the claimant’s asbestos-related condition and credible evidence of exposure to a specific NARCO asbestos-containing product. Further, the NARCO Trust is eligible to receive cash dividends from Harbison-Walker International Inc (“HWI”), the reorganized and renamed entity that emerged, fully operational, from the NARCO bankruptcy. The NARCO Trust is required to use any funding received from HWI to pay Annual Contribution Claims until those funds are exhausted. It is only at this point that Honeywell’s funding obligation to the Trust is triggered. Thus, there is an unrelated primary source for funding that affects Honeywell’s funding of the NARCO Trust Liability. 73 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Once operational, the NARCO Trust began to receive, process and pay claims that had been previously stayed pending the Trust becoming operational. As the NARCO Trust began to pay claims in 2014, we began to assert our on-going audit rights to review and monitor the claims processor’s adherence to the established requirements of the NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures. While doing so, we identified several issues with the way the Trust was implementing the NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures. In 2015, Honeywell filed suit against the NARCO Trust in Bankruptcy Court alleging breach of certain provisions of the NARCO Trust Agreement and NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures. The parties agreed to dismiss the proceeding without prejudice pursuant to an 18-month Standstill Agreement, which expired in October 2017. Notwithstanding its expiration, claims processing continues, and Honeywell continues to negotiate and attempt to resolve remaining disputed issues (that is, instances where Honeywell believes the NARCO Trust is not processing claims in accordance with established NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures). Honeywell reserves the right to seek judicial intervention should negotiations fail. After the NARCO Trust became effective in 2013, the $ 743 million NARCO Trust Liability was then comprised of: (i) liability for unasserted claims; and (ii) liability for claims asserted after the NARCO Trust became operational but not yet paid. Although the Company knows the number of claims filed with the NARCO Trust each year, it is not able to determine at this time the portion of the NARCO Trust Liability which represents asserted versus unasserted claims due to the lack of sufficiently reliable claims data because of the claims processing issues described previously. Honeywell continues to maintain the 2006 NARCO Trust Liability (the $ 743 million accrual less payments made to the NARCO Trust for Annual Contribution Claims), as there has not been sufficiently reliable claims data history to enable the Company to update that liability. As of December 31, 2019, all cash dividends paid to the NARCO Trust by HWI has been used to pay Annual Contribution Claims. In the fourth quarter of 2019, Honeywell funded $ 29 million to the NARCO Trust for the payment of Annual Contribution Claims. As of December 31, 2019 , the Company's total NARCO asbestos liability of $ 858 million reflects Pre-bankruptcy NARCO liability of $ 144 million and NARCO Trust Liability of $ 714 million (the $ 743 million accrual for NARCO Trust Liability was reduced by the $ 29 million payment to the NARCO Trust in the fourth quarter of 2019 for Annual Contribution Claims). Through December 31, 2019 , Pre-bankruptcy NARCO Liability has been reduced by approximately $ 2 billion since first established in 2002, largely related to settlement payments. The remaining Pre-bankruptcy NARCO liability principally represents estimated amounts owed pursuant to settlement agreements reached during the pendency of the NARCO bankruptcy proceedings that provide for the right to submit claims to the NARCO Trust subject to qualification under the terms of the settlement agreements and Trust Distribution Procedures. The other NARCO bankruptcy obligations were paid in 2013 and no further liability is recorded. Honeywell continues to evaluate the appropriateness of the 2006 NARCO Trust Liability Estimate. Despite becoming effective in 2013, the NARCO Trust has experienced delays in becoming fully operational. Violations of the Trust Distribution Procedures and the resulting disputes and challenges, a standstill pending dispute resolution, and limited claims payments, have all contributed to the lack of sufficient normalized data based on actual claims processing experience in the Trust since it became operational. As a result, we have not been able to further update the NARCO Trust Liability aside from deducting payments to the NARCO Trust for Annual Contribution Claims. The 2006 million NARCO Trust Liability Estimate continues to be appropriate because of the unresolved pending claims in the Trust, some portion of which will result in payouts in the future, and because new claims continue to be filed with the NARCO Trust. When sufficiently reliable claims data exists, we will update our estimate of the NARCO Trust Liability and it is possible that a material change may need to be recognized. The Company's insurance receivable of $ 281 million as of December 31, 2019 , corresponding to the estimated liability for asserted and unasserted NARCO asbestos claims, reflects coverage which reimburses Honeywell for portions of NARCO-related indemnity and defense costs and is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market. We conduct analyses to estimate the probable amount of insurance that is recoverable for asbestos claims. While the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. We made judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers. 74 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Bendix Products —Bendix manufactured automotive brake linings that contained chrysotile asbestos in an encapsulated form. Claimants consist largely of individuals who allege exposure to asbestos from brakes from either performing or being in the vicinity of individuals who performed brake replacements. The following tables present information regarding Bendix related asbestos claims activity: Claims Activity Years Ended December 31, 2019 2018 Claims Unresolved at the beginning of year 6,209 6,280 Claims Filed 2,659 2,430 Claims Resolved ( 2,388 ) ( 2,501 ) Claims Unresolved at the end of year 6,480 6,209 Disease Distribution of Unresolved Claims December 31, 2019 2018 Mesothelioma and Other Cancer Claims 3,399 2,949 Nonmalignant Claims 3,081 3,260 Total Claims 6,480 6,209 Honeywell has experienced average resolution values per claim excluding legal costs as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 2016 2015 (in whole dollars) Malignant claims $ 50,200 $ 55,300 $ 56,000 $ 44,000 $ 44,000 Nonmalignant claims $ 3,900 $ 4,700 $ 2,800 $ 4,485 $ 100 It is not possible to predict whether resolution values for Bendix-related asbestos claims will increase, decrease or stabilize in the future. The Company's consolidated financial statements reflect an estimated liability for resolution of asserted (claims filed as of the financial statement date) and unasserted Bendix-related asbestos claims and excludes the Company’s legal fees to defend such asbestos claims which will continue to be expensed by the Company as they are incurred. We have valued Bendix asserted and unasserted claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. We update the resolution values used to estimate the cost of Bendix asserted and unasserted claims during the fourth quarter each year. Honeywell reflects the inclusion of all years of epidemiological disease projection through 2059 when estimating the liability for unasserted Bendix-related asbestos claims. Such liability for unasserted Bendix-related asbestos claims is based on historic and anticipated claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. Our insurance receivable corresponding to the liability for settlement of asserted and unasserted Bendix asbestos claims reflects coverage which is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market. Based on our ongoing analysis of the probable insurance recovery, insurance receivables are recorded in the financial statements simultaneous with the recording of the estimated liability for the underlying asbestos claims. This determination is based on our analysis of the underlying insurance policies, our historical experience with our insurers, our ongoing review of the solvency of our insurers, judicial determinations relevant to our insurance programs, and our consideration of the impacts of any settlements reached with our insurers. In conjunction with the Garrett spin-off, the Company entered into an indemnification and reimbursement agreement with a Garrett subsidiary, pursuant to which Garrett’s subsidiary will have an obligation to make cash payments to Honeywell in amounts equal to (i) 90% of Honeywell’s asbestos-related liability payments primarily related to the Bendix business in the United States, as well as certain environmental-related liability payments and accounts payable and non-United States asbestos-related liability payments, in each case related to legacy elements of the Garrett business, including the legal costs of defending and resolving such liabilities, less (ii) 90% of Honeywell’s net insurance receipts and, as may be applicable, certain other recoveries associated with such liabilities. The amount payable to Honeywell 75 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) in respect of such liabilities arising in any given year will be subject to a cap of approximately Euro 150 million (equivalent to $ 175 million at the time the indemnification and reimbursement agreement was entered into). The obligation will continue until the earlier of December 31, 2048, or December 31 of the third consecutive year during which the annual obligation has been less than the Euro equivalent, at the fixed exchange rate at time of the indemnification and reimbursement agreement was entered into, of $ 25 million . Reimbursements associated with this agreement were $ 152 million and $ 42 million in 2019 and 2018 , respectively, and offset operating cash outflows incurred by the Company. As the Company records the accruals for matters covered by the agreement, a corresponding receivable from Garrett is recorded for 90 percent of that accrual as determined by the terms of the agreement. This receivable amount recorded in 2019 was $ 16 million . In 2018 , subsequent to the spin-off, the Company recorded a reversal to the receivable for $ 17 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 . As of December 31, 2019 , Other Current Assets and Other Assets includes $ 115 million and $ 947 million representing the short-term and long-term portion of the receivable amount due from Garrett under the indemnification and reimbursement agreement. As of December 31, 2018, Other Current Assets and Other Assets includes $ 171 million and $ 1,058 million representing the short-term and long-term portion of the receivable amount due from Garrett under the indemnification and reimbursement agreement. On December 2, 2019, Garrett Motion Inc. and Garrett ASASCO Inc. filed a Summons with Notice and commenced a lawsuit in the Commercial Division of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York seeking to invalidate the indemnification and reimbursement agreement between Garrett and Honeywell. Garrett seeks damages and a declaratory judgment based on various claims set forth in the Summons with Notice. On January 15, 2020, Garrett filed its complaint in the action, which asserted the same claims. We strongly believe that Garrett's allegations have no merit, nor are they material to Honeywell. We believe we have fully complied with our obligations under the Agreement and that the Agreement is enforceable. On September 13, 2018, following completion of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Division of Corporation Finance’s review of our prior accounting for liabilities for unasserted Bendix-related asbestos claims, the SEC Division of Enforcement advised that it had opened an investigation related to this matter. On August 28, 2019, the SEC informed the Company that it had concluded its investigation and that it does not intend to recommend any enforcement action against Honeywell. On October 31, 2018, David Kanefsky, a Honeywell shareholder, filed a putative class action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey alleging violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 related to the prior accounting for Bendix asbestos claims. On May 15, 2019, Wayne County Employees’ Retirement System, another Honeywell shareholder, filed a putative class action asserting the same claims relating to substantially the same alleged conduct in the same jurisdiction. On December 16, 2019, the court denied Wayne County Employees' Retirement System's motion to be appointed as substitute lead plaintiff in the Kanefsky action. On December 30, 2019, the lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint in the Kanefsky action. We believe the claims related to the prior accounting for Bendix asbestos claims have no merit. Other Matters The Company is subject to a number of other lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability, prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, and environmental, health and safety matters. We recognize a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. We continually assess the likelihood of adverse judgments of outcomes in these matters, as well as potential ranges of possible losses (taking into consideration any insurance recoveries), based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Included in these other matters are the following: Honeywell v. United Auto Workers (UAW) et. al —In September 2011, the UAW and certain Honeywell retirees (Plaintiffs) filed a suit in the Eastern District of Michigan (the District Court) alleging that a series of Master Collective Bargaining Agreements (MCBAs) between Honeywell and the UAW provided the retirees with rights to lifetime, vested healthcare benefits that could never be changed or reduced. Plaintiffs alleged that Honeywell had violated those vested rights by implementing express limitations (CAPS) on the amount Honeywell contributed toward healthcare coverage for the retirees. Honeywell subsequently answered the UAW’s complaint and asserted counterclaims, including for breach of implied warranty. Between 2014 and 2015, Honeywell began enforcing the CAPS against former employees. In response, the UAW and certain of the Plaintiffs filed a motion seeking a ruling that the MCBAs do not limit Honeywell’s obligation to contribute to healthcare coverage for those retirees. 76 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) On March 29, 2018, the District Court issued its opinion resolving all pending summary judgment motions, except for Honeywell’s counterclaim for breach of implied warranty, which has since been dismissed without prejudice. In the opinion, the District Court held that the MCBAs do not promise retirees vested, lifetime benefits that survive expiration of the MCBAs. Based on this ruling, Honeywell terminated the retirees healthcare coverage benefits altogether as of July 31, 2018. In response, the UAW filed a motion to enjoin Honeywell from completely terminating coverage as of July 31, 2018, arguing that the CAPS themselves are vested and that Honeywell must continue to provide retiree medical benefits at the capped level. On July 28, 2018, the District Court denied the UAW’s motion and entered a final judgment consistent with its March 2018 ruling. The UAW has appealed this decision to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. Honeywell believes the District Court’s ruling will be upheld. In the March 2018 opinion, the District Court also held that Honeywell is obligated under the MCBAs to pay the “full premium” for retiree healthcare rather than the capped amount. Based on this ruling, Honeywell would be required to pay monetary damages to retirees for any past years in which Honeywell paid less than the “full premium” of their healthcare coverage. Such damages would be limited, depending on the retiree group, to a two to three-year period ending when the 2017 MCBA expired, and Honeywell would have no ongoing obligation to continue funding healthcare coverage for subsequent periods. Honeywell has appealed the District Court’s ruling on this “full premium” damages issue, and believes that the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals will reverse the District Court on that issue. In the event the Sixth Circuit were to sustain the District Court’s ruling on this issue, Honeywell would be liable for damages of at least $ 12 million . Petrobras and Unaoil —We are cooperating with certain investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), the SEC and Brazilian authorities relating to our use of third parties who previously worked for our UOP business in Brazil in relation to Petróleo Brasileiro S.A. (Petrobras). The investigations are focused on compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar Brazilian laws, and involve, among other things, document production and interviews with former and current management and employees. The DOJ and the SEC are also examining a matter involving a foreign subsidiary’s prior engagement of Unaoil S.A.M. in Algeria. We are cooperating with the authorities in each of the above matters. While we cannot predict the outcome of these matters, based on the facts currently known to us, we do not anticipate that these matters will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows. In re Resideo Technologies, Inc. Securities Litigation —On January 7, 2020, The Gabelli Asset Fund and certain related parties filed a putative class action complaint against Resideo and Honeywell in the U.S. District Court for the District of Minnesota alleging violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 related to Resideo's spinoff from Honeywell in October 2018. On January 27, 2020, this putative class action was consolidated with certain previously-filed actions asserting claims relating to substantially the same matters into a single class action under the title In re Resideo Technologies, Inc. Securities Litigation. We believe the allegations against Honeywell regarding the Resideo spinoff have no merit. Given the uncertainty inherent in litigation and investigations (including the specific matters referenced above), we do not believe it is possible to develop estimates of reasonably possible loss in excess of current accruals for these matters (other than as specifically set forth above). Considering our past experience and existing accruals, we do not expect the outcome of these matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, potential liabilities are subject to change due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, which could cause us to pay damage awards or settlements (or become subject to equitable remedies) that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid. 77 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Warranties and Guarantees In the normal course of business, the Company issues product warranties and product performance guarantees. We accrue for the estimated cost of product warranties and performance guarantees based on contract terms and historical experience at the time of sale. Adjustments to initial obligations for warranties and guarantees are made as changes to the obligations become reasonably estimable. The following table summarizes information concerning our recorded obligations for product warranties and product performance guarantees. Years Ended December 31, 2019 2018 2017 Beginning of year $ 310 $ 408 $ 487 Accruals for warranties/guarantees issued during the year 173 208 215 Adjustment of pre-existing warranties/guarantees ( 34 ) ( 78 ) ( 27 ) Settlement of warranty/guarantee claims ( 180 ) ( 228 ) ( 267 ) End of year $ 269 $ 310 $ 408 Product warranties and product performance guarantees are included in the following balance sheet accounts: December 31, 2019 2018 Accrued liabilities $ 213 $ 243 Other liabilities 56 67 $ 269 $ 310 Note 21. Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits The Company sponsors a number of both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Pension benefits for many of our U.S. employees are provided through non-contributory, qualified and non-qualified defined benefit plans. All non-union hourly and salaried employees joining Honeywell for the first time after December 31, 2012, are not eligible to participate in Honeywell’s U.S. defined benefit pension plans. We also sponsor defined benefit pension plans which cover non-U.S. employees who are not U.S. citizens, in certain jurisdictions, principally the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and Canada. Other pension plans outside of the U.S. are not material to the Company either individually or in the aggregate. The Company also sponsors postretirement benefit plans that provide health care benefits and life insurance coverage mainly to U.S. eligible retirees. None of Honeywell’s U.S. employees are eligible for a retiree medical subsidy from the Company. In addition, the vast majority of Honeywell’s U.S. retirees either have no Company subsidy or have a fixed-dollar subsidy amount. This significantly limits our exposure to the impact of future health care cost increases. The retiree medical and life insurance plans are not funded. Claims and expenses are paid from our operating cash flow. 78 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Major actuarial assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations and net periodic benefit (income) cost for our significant benefit plans are presented in the following table as weighted averages. Pension Benefits U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 2017 Actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations as of December 31: Discount rate 3.22 % 4.35 % 3.68 % 1.81 % 2.63 % 2.36 % Expected annual rate of compensation increase 3.25 % 3.25 % 4.50 % 2.47 % 2.46 % 0.73 % Actuarial assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit (income) cost for years ended December 31: Discount rate—benefit obligation 4.35 % 3.68 % 4.20 % 2.63 % 2.36 % 2.51 % Discount rate—service cost 4.47 % 3.77 % 4.42 % 2.26 % 2.20 % 2.14 % Discount rate—interest cost 3.94 % 3.27 % 3.49 % 2.34 % 2.08 % 2.19 % Expected rate of return on plan assets 6.75 % 7.75 % 7.75 % 5.14 % 6.23 % 6.43 % Expected annual rate of compensation increase 3.25 % 4.50 % 4.50 % 2.46 % 2.49 % 2.17 % Other Postretirement Benefits 2019 2018 2017 Actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations as of December 31: Discount rate 3.03 % 4.07 % 3.39 % Actuarial assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for years ended December 31: Discount rate (1) 4.07 % 3.39 % 3.60 % (1) Discount rate was 3.65 % for 1/1/2017 through 2/28/2017. Rate was changed to 3.60 % for the remainder of 2017 due to a Plan remeasurement as of 3/1/2017. The discount rate for the Company's U.S. pension and other postretirement benefits plans reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be settled at the measurement date of December 31. To determine discount rates for our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans, we use a modeling process that involves matching the expected cash outflows of our benefit plans to a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments. We use the single weighted-average yield of this hypothetical portfolio as a discount rate benchmark. We utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension benefit (income) for our significant pension plans. This approach applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the pension benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows and provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected cash flows and their corresponding spot rates. For our U.S. pension plans, the single weighted average spot rates used to determine service and interest costs for 2020 are 3.33 % and 2.76 % . The discount rate used to determine the other postretirement benefit obligation is lower principally due to a shorter expected duration of other postretirement plan obligations as compared to pension plan obligations. 83 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) The Company plans to use an expected rate of return on U.S. plan assets of 6.15 % for 2020 down from 6.75 % for 2019 reflecting a decline in interest rates and additional re-balancing of assets to more fixed income. Our asset return assumption is based on historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with current market conditions and broad asset mix considerations with a focus on long-term trends rather than short-term market conditions. We review the expected rate of return on an annual basis and revise it as appropriate. For non-U.S. benefit plans actuarial assumptions reflect economic and market factors relevant to each country. Pension Benefits The following amounts relate to the Company's significant pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations exceeding the fair value of plan assets: December 31, U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans 2019 2018 2019 2018 Projected benefit obligation $ 357 $ 327 $ 1,018 $ 1,668 Accumulated benefit obligation $ 347 $ 321 $ 973 $ 1,604 Fair value of plan assets $ — $ — $ 233 $ 873 The accumulated benefit obligation for the Company's U.S. defined benefit pension plans was $ 17.2 billion and $ 16.1 billion and for our Non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans was $ 6.8 billion and $ 6.1 billion at December 31, 2019 and 2018 . The Company's asset investment strategy for our U.S. pension plans focuses on maintaining a diversified portfolio using various asset classes in order to achieve our long-term investment objectives on a risk adjusted basis. During 2019 , we continued to employ a de-risking strategy which increases the matching characteristics of our assets relative to our obligation. Our long-term target allocations are as follows: 55 % - 70 % fixed income securities and cash, 25 % - 40 % equity securities, 5 % - 10 % real estate investments, and 10 % - 20 % other types of investments. Equity securities include publicly-traded stock of companies located both inside and outside the United States. Fixed income securities include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, mortgage-backed securities, and U.S. Treasuries. Real estate investments include direct investments in commercial properties and investments in real estate funds. Other types of investments include investments in private equity and hedge funds that follow several different strategies. We review our assets on a regular basis to ensure that we are within the targeted asset allocation ranges and, if necessary, asset balances are adjusted back within target allocations. The Company's non-U.S. pension assets are typically managed by decentralized fiduciary committees with the Honeywell Corporate Investments group providing funding and investment guidance. Our non-U.S. investment policies are different for each country as local regulations, funding requirements, and financial and tax considerations are part of the funding and investment allocation process in each country. In accordance with ASU 2015-07, “Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820)”, certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value (NAV) per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in the following tables are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented for the total pension benefits plan assets. 84 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

Sufficient cash or cash equivalents are held by our pension plans to cover the notional value of the futures contracts. At December 31, 2019 and 2018 , our U.S. plans had contracts with notional amounts of $ 4,463 million and $ 2,808 million . At December 31, 2019 and 2018 , our non-U.S. plans had contracts with notional amounts of $ 479 million and $ 111 million . In both our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, the notional derivative exposure is related to outstanding equity and fixed income futures contracts. Common stocks, preferred stocks, real estate investment trusts, and short-term investments are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded. Corporate bonds, mortgages, asset-backed securities, and government securities are valued either by using pricing models, bids provided by brokers 87 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) or dealers, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows and as such include adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks. Certain securities are held in collective trust funds which are valued using net asset values provided by the administrators of the funds. Investments in private equity, debt, real estate and hedge funds and direct private investments are valued at estimated fair value based on quarterly financial information received from the investment advisor and/or general partner. Investments in real estate properties are valued on a quarterly basis using the income approach. Valuation estimates are periodically supplemented by third party appraisals. The Company's funding policy for qualified defined benefit pension plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to satisfy regulatory funding standards. In 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , we were not required to make contributions to our U.S. pension plans and no contributions were made. We are not required to make any contributions to our U.S. pension plans in 2020 . In 2019 , contributions of $ 43 million were made to our non-U.S. pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding requirements. In 2020 , we expect to make contributions of cash and/or marketable securities of approximately $ 112 million to our non-U.S. pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards. Contributions for both our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans do not reflect benefits paid directly from Company assets. Benefit payments, including amounts to be paid from Company assets, and reflecting expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows: U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans 2020 $ 1,159 $ 282 2021 1,151 288 2022 1,145 296 2023 1,138 303 2024 1,128 311 2025-2029 5,353 1,690 Other Postretirement Benefits December 31, 2019 2018 Assumed health care cost trend rate: Health care cost trend rate assumed for next year 7.00 % 7.00 % Rate that the cost trend rate gradually declines to 5.00 % 5.00 % Year that the rate reaches the rate it is assumed to remain at 2029 2029 The assumed health care cost trend rate has a significant effect on the amounts reported.

Segment Financial Data Honeywell globally manages its business operations through four reportable operating segments. Segment information is consistent with how management reviews the businesses, makes investing and resource allocation decisions and assesses operating performance. Honeywell’s senior management evaluates segment performance based on segment profit. Each segment’s profit is measured as segment income (loss) before taxes excluding general corporate unallocated expense, interest and other financial charges, stock compensation expense, pension and other postretirement income (expense), repositioning and other charges, and other items within Other (income) expense.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Honeywell International Inc. and subsidiaries (the ""Company"") as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareowners’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 , and the related notes (collectively referred to as the ""financial statements""). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019 , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""generally accepted accounting principles""). Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. Basis for Opinions The Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. 93 Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Asbestos Related Liabilities - North American Refractories Company (NARCO) Trust Liability - Refer to Note 20 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company is named in asbestos related personal injury claims related to a predecessor company, NARCO. Such claims arise primarily from alleged occupational exposure to asbestos-containing refractory brick and mortar for high-temperature applications. Since becoming effective in 2013, the NARCO Trust has experienced delays in becoming fully operational. Disputes and challenges regarding violations of the Trust Distribution Procedures, an expired 18-month standstill agreement and limited claims payments, have all contributed to a lack of sufficient normalized data based on actual claims processing experience in the NARCO Trust. Although the Company knows the number of claims filed with the NARCO Trust each year, it is not able at this time to determine the portion of the NARCO Trust Liability which represents asserted versus unasserted claims due to the lack of sufficiently reliable claims data. Maintaining the NARCO Trust Liability is inherently subjective as it requires management to make significant assumptions and judgements regarding the sufficiency and reliability of historical claims filing data and experience and expected future claims filing rates. Given the subjectivity in maintaining the NARCO Trust Liability the auditing of the NARCO Trust Liability required a high degree of auditor judgment. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the NARCO Trust Liability included the following, among others: • We tested the effectiveness of internal controls over the annual third-party assessment of the sufficiency and reliability of the NARCO Trust claims data including controls over the review of management’s assumptions and claims data used to estimate the NARCO Trust Liability. • We made inquiries of internal and external legal counsel regarding the regulatory and litigation environments related to the NARCO Trust Liability. • With the assistance of our internal actuarial specialists, we evaluated NARCO Trust claims data to assess the reasonableness of management’s conclusion that such data is not sufficiently reliable to enable the Company to update the estimate of the recorded NARCO Trust Liability. Revenue Recognition and Contracts with Customers - Long-Term Fixed Price Contracts (Performance Materials and Technologies (PMT)) - Refer to Note 1 and Note 7 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company’s PMT segment develops and manufactures advanced materials, process technologies, and automation solutions. A portion of PMT’s revenue is generated from long-term fixed price contracts whereby revenue is recognized over the contract term (“over time”) as the work progresses and control of the goods and services is transferred to the customer. Revenue for these contracts is recognized based on the extent of progress toward completion, generally measured by using a cost-to-cost basis input method. 94 Accounting for PMT’s long-term fixed price contracts requires management’s judgment in estimating total contract costs. Contract costs, which can be incurred over several years, are largely determined based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms and consider factors such as historical performance, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, and anticipated labor agreements. Given the significant judgments necessary to estimate costs associated with these long-term contracts, auditing PMT’s long-term fixed price contracts requires a high degree of auditor judgment. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to PMT’s long-term fixed price contracts included the following, among others: • We tested the effectiveness of internal controls over the recognition of revenue and the determination of estimated contract costs including controls over the review of management’s assumptions and key inputs used to recognize revenue and costs on long-term fixed price contracts using the cost-to-cost input method. • We evaluated the appropriateness and consistency of management’s methods and assumptions used to recognize revenue and costs on long-term fixed price contracts using the cost-to-cost input method to recognize revenue over time. • We selected a sample of long-term fixed price contracts and evaluated the estimates of total cost for each of the long-term fixed price contracts by: ▪ Comparing costs incurred to date to the costs management estimated to be incurred to date. ▪ Evaluating management’s ability to achieve the estimates of total cost by performing corroborating inquiries with Company personnel, including project managers, and comparing the estimates to documentation such as management’s work plans, contract terms and requirements, and purchase orders with suppliers. Our evaluation of management’s assumptions included consideration of historical and current project performance such as consistency of gross margin, identified risks related to project timing including technical and schedule matters, and the status of internal and third-party activities such as hardware, software, and labor. ▪ Performing a substantive analytical procedure, in which we compared the estimated costs to complete to an independent estimate of costs to complete that factored in information obtained from the corroborating inquiries and documentation obtained such as management’s work plans, contract terms and requirements, and purchase orders with suppliers. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Charlotte, North Carolina February 14, 2020 We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2014. 95 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure Not Applicable. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Honeywell management maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the specified time periods and accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There have been no changes that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Honeywell’s internal control over financial reporting that have occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2019 . Our management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) at December 31, 2019 . Based on these evaluations, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 were effective as of December 31, 2019 . Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Honeywell management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Honeywell’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Management assessed the effectiveness of Honeywell’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 . In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) . Based on this assessment, management determined that Honeywell maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 . The effectiveness of Honeywell’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Item 9B. Other Information Not Applicable. 96 PART III. Item 10.

EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS As of December 31, 2019 , information about our equity compensation plans is as follows: Plan category Number of Shares to be Issued Upon Exercise of Outstanding Options, Warrants and Rights Weighted-Average Exercise Price of Outstanding Options, Warrants and Rights Number of Securities Remaining Available for Future Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans (Excluding Securities Reflected in Column (a)) (a) (b) (c) Equity compensation plans approved by security holders 22,496,879 (1) 109.87 (2) 40,001,939 (3) Equity compensation plans not approved by security holders 293,763 (4) N/A (5) N/A (6) Total 22,790,642 109.87 40,001,939 (1) Equity compensation plans approved by shareowners which are included in column (a) of the table are the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan, the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan, and the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (including 18,473,640 97 shares of Common Stock to be issued for options; 2,820,462 RSUs subject to continued employment; 402,054 RSUs at target level and subject to company performance metrics and continued employment, and 525,252 deferred RSUs); and the 2016 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors and the 2006 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors (including 257,922 shares of Common Stock to be issued for options; and 17,549 RSUs subject to continued services). RSUs included in column (a) of the table represent the full number of RSUs awarded and outstanding whereas the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon vesting will be lower than what is reflected on the table because the value of shares required to meet employee tax withholding requirements are not issued. Because the number of future shares that may be distributed to employees participating in the Honeywell Global Stock Plan is unknown, no shares attributable to that plan are included in column (a) of the table above. (2) Column (b) relates to stock options and does not include any exercise price for RSUs because an RSU’s value is dependent upon attainment of certain performance goals or continued employment or service and they are settled for shares of Common Stock on a one-for-one basis. (3) The number of shares that may be issued under the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan as of December 31, 2019 is 37,364,854 which includes the following additional shares that may again be available for issuance: shares that are settled for cash, expire, are canceled, or under similar prior plans, are tendered as option exercise price or tax withholding obligations, are reacquired with cash option exercise price or with monies attributable to any tax deduction to Honeywell upon the exercise of an option, or are under any outstanding awards assumed under any equity compensation plan of an entity acquired by Honeywell. No securities are available for future issuance under the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan or the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan. The number of shares that may be issued under the Honeywell Global Stock Plan as of December 31, 2019 is 1,770,812. This plan is an umbrella plan for three plans described below maintained solely for eligible employees of participating non-U.S. countries. • The UK Sharebuilder Plan allows an eligible UK employee to invest taxable earnings in Common Stock. The Company matches those shares and dividends paid are used to purchase additional shares of Common Stock. For the year ending December 31, 2019, 34,787 shares were credited to participants’ accounts under the UK Sharebuilder Plan. • The Honeywell Aerospace Ireland Share Participation Plan and the Honeywell Measurex (Ireland) Limited Group Employee Profit Sharing Plan allow eligible Irish employees to contribute a percentage of base pay and/or bonus that is invested in Common Stock. For the year ending December 31, 2019, 2,083 shares of Common Stock were credited to participants’ accounts under these plans. The remaining 866,273 shares included in column (c) are shares remaining under the 2016 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors . (4) Equity compensation plans not approved by shareowners included in the table refers to the Honeywell Excess Benefit Plan and Supplemental Savings Plan. The Honeywell Excess Benefit Plan and Supplemental Savings Plan for highly compensated employees is an unfunded, non-tax qualified plan that provides benefits equal to the employee deferrals and company matching allocations that would have been provided under Honeywell’s U.S. tax-qualified savings plan if the Internal Revenue Code limitations on compensation and contributions did not apply. The Company matching contribution is credited to participants’ accounts in the form of notional shares of Common Stock. The notional shares are distributed in the form of actual shares of Common Stock. The number of shares to be issued under this plan based on the value of the notional shares as of December 31, 2019 is 293,763. (5) Column (b) does not include any exercise price for notional shares allocated to employees under Honeywell’s equity compensation plans not approved by shareowners because all of these shares are only settled for shares of Common Stock on a one-for-one basis. (6) The amount of securities available for future issuance under the Honeywell Excess Benefit Plan and Supplemental Savings Plan is not determinable because the number of securities that may be issued under this plan depends upon the amount deferred to the plan by participants in future years. 98 Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions Information relating to certain relationships and related transactions is contained in the Proxy Statement referred to above in Item 10. Directors and Executive Officers of the Registrant, and such information is incorporated herein by reference. Item 14.

Our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to those reports, are available free of charge on our website (www.honeywell.com) under the heading Investor Relations (see SEC Filings and Reports) immediately after they are filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In addition, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company incorporates by reference certain information from parts of its Proxy Statement for the 2019 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, which we expect to file with the SEC on or about March 14, 2019, and which will also be available free of charge on our website. Major Businesses On October 1, 2018, the Company completed the spin-off of its Transportation Systems business, formerly part of Aerospace, and on October 29, 2018, the Company completed the spin-off of its Homes and Global Distribution business, formerly part of Home and Building Technologies. Therefore, as of the end of 2018, those businesses were no longer part of the Company. Following the spin-off of the Homes and Global Distribution business, the Home and Building Technologies segment was renamed Honeywell Building Technologies. The major products/services, customers/uses and key competitors of each of our segments are: Aerospace Aerospace is a leading global supplier of products, software and services for aircrafts that it sells to original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and other customers in a variety of end markets including: air transport, regional, business and general aviation aircraft, airlines, aircraft operators and defense and space contractors. Aerospace products and services include auxiliary power units, propulsion engines, environmental control systems, integrated avionics, wireless connectivity services, electric power systems, engine controls, flight safety, communications, navigation hardware, data and software applications, radar and surveillance systems, aircraft lighting, management and technical services, advanced systems and instruments, satellite and space components, aircraft wheels and brakes, repair and overhaul services and thermal systems. Aerospace also provides spare parts, repair, overhaul and maintenance services (principally to aircraft operators) and connected solutions and data services for the aftermarket. Honeywell Building Technologies Honeywell Building Technologies is a leading global provider of products, software, solutions and technologies that enable commercial building owners and occupants to ensure their facilities are safe, energy efficient, sustainable and productive. Honeywell Building Technologies products and services include advanced software applications for building control and optimization; sensors, switches, control systems and instruments for energy management; access control; video surveillance; fire products; remote patient monitoring systems; and installation, maintenance and upgrades of systems that keep buildings safe, comfortable and productive. 1 Performance Materials and Technologies Performance Materials and Technologies is a global leader in developing and manufacturing high-quality performance chemicals and materials, process technologies and automation solutions. UOP provides process technology, products, including catalysts and adsorbents, equipment and consulting services that enable customers to efficiently produce gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, petrochemicals and renewable fuels for the petroleum refining, gas processing, petrochemical, and other industries.

Productivity Solutions products and services include mobile devices and software for computing, data collection and thermal printing; supply chain and warehouse automation equipment, software and solutions; custom-engineered sensors, switches and controls for sensing and productivity solutions; and software-based data and asset management productivity solutions. Competition We are subject to competition in substantially all product and service areas. Some of our key competitors are:  Aerospace: Garmin, Thales, Safran and United Technologies  Honeywell Building Technologies: Emerson Electric, Itron, Johnson Controls, Schneider Electric and Siemens  Performance Materials and Technologies: Albemarle, BASF, DowDupont, Emerson Electric and Sinopec  Safety and Productivity Solutions: 3M, Mine Safety Appliances (MSA), Kion Group, TE Connectivity and Zebra Technologies Our businesses compete on a variety of factors such as price, quality, reliability, delivery, customer service, performance, applied technology, product innovation and product recognition. Brand identity, service to customers and quality are important competitive factors for our products and services, and there is considerable price competition. Other competitive factors include breadth of product line, research and development efforts and technical and managerial capability. While our competitive position varies among our products and services, we believe we are a significant competitor in each of our major product and service classes. Many of our competitors have substantial financial resources and significant technological capabilities. In addition, some of our products compete with the captive component divisions of OEMs. Aerospace Sales Our Aerospace segment sales were 37%, 36% and 38% of our total sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016. Our sales to commercial aerospace OEMs were 7%, 6% and 6% of our total sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016. In addition, our sales to commercial aftermarket customers of aerospace products and services were 13%, 13% and 12% of our total sales in 2018, 2017 and 2016. 2 U.S. Government Sales Sales to the U.S. Government (principally by Aerospace), acting through its various departments and agencies and through prime contractors, amounted to $3,403 million, $3,203 million and $3,330 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, which included sales to the U.S. Department of Defense, as a prime contractor and subcontractor, of $2,832 million, $2,546 million and $2,647 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016. We do not expect our overall operating results to be significantly affected by any proposed changes in 2019 federal defense spending due principally to the varied mix of the government programs which impact us (OEMs production, engineering development programs, aftermarket spares and repairs and overhaul programs), as well as our diversified commercial businesses. Backlog Our backlog represents the estimated remaining value of work to be performed under firm contracts. Starting in 2018 following the adoption of the new revenue recognition standard, backlog is equal to our remaining performance obligations under the contracts that meet the new guidance on revenue from contracts with customers as discussed in Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Backlog was $24,850 million and $17,690 million at December 31, 2018 and 2017. We expect to recognize approximately 56% of our remaining performance obligations as revenue in 2019, and the remaining balance thereafter. International Operations We are engaged in manufacturing, sales, service and research and development (R&D) globally. U.S. exports and non-U.S. manufactured products are significant to our operations. U.S. exports comprised 13% of our total sales in 2018, 12% in 2017 and 13% in 2016. Non-U.S. manufactured products and services, mainly in Europe and Asia, were 43% of our total sales in 2018, 44% in 2017 and 43% in 2016. Manufactured Products and Systems and Performance of Services Year Ended December 31, 2018 Aerospace Honeywell Building Technologies Performance Materials and Technologies Safety and Productivity Solutions (% of Segment Sales) U.S. Exports 21 % 1 % 16 % 3 % Non-U.S. 31 % 52 % 55 % 40 % Information related to risks attendant to our foreign operations is included in Item 1A. Risk Factors under the caption Macroeconomic and Industry Risks. Raw Materials The principal raw materials used in our operations are generally readily available. Although we occasionally experience disruption in raw materials supply, we experienced no significant problems in the purchase of key raw materials or commodities in 2018. We are not dependent on any one supplier for a material amount of our raw materials. The costs of certain key raw materials, including R240, copper, fluorspar, tungsten salts, ethylene, and perchloroethylene in Performance Materials and Technologies and nickel, steel, titanium and other metals in Aerospace, are expected to continue to fluctuate. We will continue to attempt to offset raw material cost increases with formula or long-term supply agreements, price increases and hedging activities where feasible. We do not presently anticipate that a shortage of raw materials will cause any material adverse impacts during 2019. 3 Patents, Trademarks, Licenses and Distribution Rights Our segments are not dependent upon any single patent or related group of patents, or any licenses or distribution rights. In our judgment, our intellectual property rights are adequate for the conduct of our business. We believe that, in the aggregate, the rights under our patents, trademarks and licenses are generally important to our operations, but we do not consider any individual patent, trademark or any licensing or distribution rights related to a specific process or product to be of material importance in relation to our total business. Environment We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements regarding protection of human health and the environment. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage, and of resulting financial liability, in connection with our business. Some risk of environmental damage is, however, inherent in some of our operations and products, as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses. We are and have been engaged in the handling, manufacturing, use and disposal of many substances classified as hazardous by one or more regulatory agencies. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury, and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of these substances are in accord with environmental and safety laws and regulations. It is also possible that future knowledge or other developments, such as improved capability to detect substances in the environment or increasingly strict environmental laws and standards and enforcement policies, could bring into question our current or past handling, manufacture, use or disposal of these substances. Among other environmental requirements, we are subject to the federal Superfund and similar state and foreign laws and regulations, under which we have been designated as a potentially responsible party that may be liable for cleanup costs associated with current and former operating sites and various hazardous waste sites, some of which are on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencys National Priority List. Although there is a possibility that a responsible party might have to bear more than its proportional share of the cleanup costs if it is unable to obtain appropriate contribution from other responsible parties, we do not anticipate having to bear significantly more than our proportional share in multi-party situations taken as a whole. We do not believe that existing or pending climate change legislation, regulation, or international treaties or accords are reasonably likely to have a material effect in the foreseeable future on the Companys business or markets that it serves, nor on its results of operations, capital expenditures, earnings, competitive position or financial standing. We will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area. Employees We have approximately 114,000 employees at December 31, 2018, of whom approximately 44,000 are located in the United States. 4 Executive Officers of the Registrant The executive officers of Honeywell, listed as follows, are elected annually by the Board of Directors.

Risk Factors Cautionary Statement About Forward-Looking Statements We describe many of the trends and other factors that drive our business and future results in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and in other parts of this report (including this Item 1A). Such discussions contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. 5 Forward-looking statements are those that address activities, events or developments that management intends, expects, projects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future. They are based on managements assumptions and assessments in light of past experience and trends, current economic and industry conditions, expected future developments and other relevant factors. They are not guarantees of future performance, and actual results, developments and business decisions may differ significantly from those envisaged by our forward-looking statements. We do not undertake to update or revise any of our forward-looking statements. Our forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that can affect our performance in both the near-and long-term. These forward-looking statements should be considered in light of the information included in this Form 10-K, including, in particular, the factors discussed below. These factors may be revised or supplemented in subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. Risk Factors Our business, operating results, cash flows and financial condition are subject to the principal risks and uncertainties set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or from our anticipated future results. Macroeconomic and Industry Risks Industry and economic conditions may adversely affect the markets and operating conditions of our customers, which in turn can affect demand for our products and services and our results of operations.  Aerospace Operating results of Aerospace are directly tied to cyclical industry and economic conditions, as well as changes in customer buying patterns of aftermarket parts, supplier stability, factory transitions and global supply chain capacity constraints that may lead to shortages of crucial components. The operating results of our Commercial Aviation business unit may be adversely affected by downturns in the global demand for air travel which impacts new aircraft production or the delay or cancellation of new aircraft orders, delays in launch schedules for new aircraft, the retirement of aircraft and global flying hours, which impact air transport, regional, business and general aviation aircraft utilization rates. Operating results could also be impacted by changes in overall trends related to end market demand for the product portfolio, as well as, new entrants and non-traditional players entering the market. Operating results in our Defense and Space business unit may be affected by the mix of U.S. and foreign government appropriations for defense and space programs and by compliance risks. Results may also be impacted by the potential introduction of counterfeit parts into our global supply chain.  Honeywell Building Technologies Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in the level of global commercial construction activity (including retrofits and upgrades), lower capital spending and operating expenditures on building projects, less industrial plant expansion, changes in the competitive landscape including new market entrants and new technologies, and fluctuations in inventory levels in distribution channels.  Performance Materials and Technologies Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in capacity utilization for chemical, industrial, refining, petrochemical and semiconductor plants, our customers availability of capital for refinery construction and expansion, raw material demand and supply volatility, product commoditization, and our ability to maximize our facilities production capacity and minimize downtime. In particular, the volatility in oil and natural gas prices have and will continue to impact our customers operating levels and capital spending and thus demand for our products and services.  Safety and Productivity Solutions Operating results may be adversely impacted by downturns in the level of global capital spending and operating expenditures, including in the oil and gas industry, reduced investments in process automation, safety monitoring, and plant capacity utilization initiatives, fluctuations in retail markets, lower customer demand due to the failure to anticipate and respond to overall trends related to end market demand, changes in the 6 competitive landscape including new market entrants and technology that may lead to product commoditization, and adverse industry economic conditions, all of which could result in lower market share, reduced selling prices and lower margins. An increasing percentage of our sales and operations is in non-U.S. jurisdictions and is subject to the economic, political, regulatory, foreign exchange and other risks of international operations. Our international operations, including U.S. exports, represent more than half of the Companys sales. Risks related to international operations include exchange control regulations, wage and price controls, antitrust regulations, employment regulations, foreign investment laws, import, export and other trade restrictions (such as sanctions and embargoes), violations by our employees of anti-corruption laws (despite our efforts to mitigate these risks), changes in regulations regarding transactions with state-owned enterprises, nationalization of private enterprises, acts of terrorism, and our ability to hire and maintain qualified staff and maintain the safety of our employees in these regions. Instability and uncertainties arising from the global geopolitical environment, and the evolving international and domestic political, regulatory and economic landscape, the potential for changes in global trade policies including sanctions and trade barriers, trends such as populism, economic nationalism and negative sentiment toward multinational companies, and the cost of compliance with increasingly complex and often conflicting regulations worldwide can impair our flexibility in modifying product, marketing, pricing or other strategies for growing our businesses, as well as our ability to improve productivity and maintain acceptable operating margins. While it is currently not known what the final outcome and full terms of the United Kingdoms future relationship with the European Union will be, it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the United Kingdom and other countries, including the United States, increased tariffs on U.K. imports and exports, and increased regulatory complexities. Existing free trade laws and regulations, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement, or any successor agreement, provide certain beneficial duties and tariffs for qualifying imports and exports. Changes in laws or policies governing the terms of foreign trade, and in particular increased trade restrictions, tariffs or taxes on imports from countries where we manufacture products or from where we import products or raw materials, either directly or through our suppliers, could have an impact on our competitive position and financial results. Operating outside of the United States also exposes us to foreign exchange risk, which we monitor and seek to reduce through hedging activities. However, foreign exchange hedging activities bear a financial cost and may not always be available to us or be successful in eliminating such volatility. Finally, we generate significant amounts of cash outside of the United States that is invested with financial and non-financial counterparties. While we employ comprehensive controls regarding global cash management to guard against cash or investment loss and to ensure our ability to fund our operations and commitments, a material disruption to the counterparties with whom we transact business could expose Honeywell to financial loss. Risks related to our defined benefit pension plans may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flow. Significant changes in actual investment return on pension assets, discount rates, and other factors could adversely affect our results of operations and require cash pension contributions in future periods. Changes in discount rates and actual asset returns different than our anticipated asset returns can result in significant non-cash actuarial gains or losses which we record in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and, if applicable, in any quarter in which an interim re-measurement is triggered. With regard to cash pension contributions, funding requirements for our pension plans are largely dependent upon interest rates, actual investment returns on pension assets and the impact of legislative or regulatory changes related to pension funding obligations. 7 Operational Risks Raw material price fluctuations, the ability of key suppliers to meet quality and delivery requirements, or catastrophic events can increase the cost of our products and services, impact our ability to meet commitments to customers and cause us to incur significant liabilities. The cost of raw materials is a key element in the cost of our products, particularly in Performance Materials and Technologies (R240, copper, fluorspar, tungsten salts, ethylene, and perchloroethylene) and in Aerospace (nickel, steel, titanium and other metals). Our inability to offset material price inflation through increased prices to customers, formula or long-term fixed price contracts with suppliers, productivity actions or through commodity hedges could adversely affect our results of operations. Many major components, product equipment items and raw materials, particularly in Aerospace, are procured or subcontracted on a single or sole-source basis. Although we maintain a qualification and performance surveillance process and we believe that sources of supply for raw materials and components are generally adequate, it is difficult to predict what effects shortages or price increases may have in the future. Our ability to manage inventory and meet delivery requirements may be constrained by our suppliers inability to scale production and adjust delivery of long-lead time products during times of volatile demand. Our inability to fill our supply needs would jeopardize our ability to fulfill obligations under commercial and government contracts, which could, in turn, result in reduced sales and profits, contract penalties or terminations, and damage to customer relationships. We may be unable to successfully execute or effectively integrate acquisitions, and divestitures may not occur as planned. We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and pursue growth through acquisitions and seek to divest non-core businesses. We may not be able to complete transactions on favorable terms, on a timely basis, or at all, and during integration we may discover cybersecurity and compliance issues. In addition, our results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted by (i) the failure of acquired businesses to meet or exceed expected returns, including risk of impairment; (ii) the failure to integrate multiple acquired businesses into Honeywell simultaneously and on schedule and/or to achieve expected synergies; (iii) the inability to dispose of non-core assets and businesses on satisfactory terms and conditions; (iv) the discovery of unanticipated liabilities, labor relations difficulties or other problems in acquired businesses for which we lack contractual protections, insurance or indemnities, or with regard to divested businesses, claims by purchasers to whom we have provided contractual indemnification and (v) the inability to collect on the indemnification and reimbursement agreements entered into with our spin-offs, Garrett Motion Inc. and Resideo Technologies, Inc. Our future growth is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies and introduce new products that achieve market acceptance in increasingly competitive markets with acceptable margins. Our future growth rate depends upon a number of factors, including our ability to (i) identify and evolve with emerging technological and broader industry trends in our target end-markets, (ii) develop and maintain competitive products, (iii) defend our market share against an ever-expanding number of competitors including many new and non-traditional competitors, (iv) enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors and prevent commoditization of our products, (v) develop, manufacture and bring compelling new products to market quickly and cost-effectively, (vi) monitor disruptive technologies and business models, (vii) achieve sufficient return on investment for new products introduced based on capital expenditures and research and development spending, (viii) respond to changes in overall trends related to end market demand, and (x) attract, develop and retain individuals with the requisite technical expertise and understanding of customers needs to develop new technologies and introduce new products. Competitors may also develop after-market services and parts for our products which attract customers and adversely affect our return on investment for new products. 8 The failure of our technologies or products to gain market acceptance due to more attractive offerings by our competitors or the failure to address any of the above factors could significantly reduce our revenues and adversely affect our competitive standing and prospects. Failure to increase productivity through sustainable operational improvements, as well as an inability to successfully execute repositioning projects or to effectively manage our workforce, may reduce our profitability or adversely impact our businesses. Our profitability and margin growth are dependent upon our ability to drive sustainable improvements. In addition, we seek productivity and cost savings benefits through repositioning actions and projects, such as consolidation of manufacturing facilities, transitions to cost-competitive regions and product line rationalizations. Risks associated with these actions include delays in execution of the planned initiatives, additional unexpected costs, realization of fewer than estimated productivity improvements and adverse effects on employee morale. We may not realize the full operational or financial benefits we expect, the recognition of these benefits may be delayed and these actions may potentially disrupt our operations. In addition, organizational changes, increased attrition, failure to create and implement a succession plan for key Company positions, not retaining key talent, inability to attract new employees with unique skills, labor relations difficulties, or workforce stoppage could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position and results of operations. As a supplier to the U.S. Government, we are subject to unique risks, such as the right of the U.S. Government to terminate contracts for convenience and to conduct audits and investigations of our operations and performance. U.S. Government contracts are subject to termination by the government, either for the convenience of the government or for our failure to perform consistent with the terms of the applicable contract. Our contracts with the U.S. Government are also subject to government audits that may recommend downward price adjustments and other changes. When appropriate and prudent, we have made adjustments and paid voluntary refunds in the past and may do so in the future. We are also subject to government investigations of business practices and compliance with government procurement regulations. If, as a result of any such investigation or other government investigations (including investigation of violations of certain environmental, employment or export laws), Honeywell or one of its businesses were found to have violated applicable law, then it could be suspended from bidding on or receiving awards of new government contracts, suspended from contract performance pending the completion of legal proceedings and/or have its export privileges suspended. Our operations and the prior operations of predecessor companies expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities. Mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we are subject to potentially material liabilities related to the remediation of environmental hazards and to claims of personal injuries or property damages that may be caused by hazardous substance releases and exposures. We continue to incur remedial response and voluntary clean-up costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. Various federal, state, local and foreign governments regulate the discharge of materials into the environment, or the use of or communications respecting certain materials in our products, and can impose substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations, and require injunctive relief measures, including installation of costly equipment or operational changes to limit emissions and/or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases, or limiting access of our products to markets, among others. In addition, changes in laws, regulations and enforcement of policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or new technology or information related to individual sites, the establishment of stricter toxicity standards with respect to certain contaminants, or the imposition of new clean-up 9 requirements or remedial techniques could require us to incur additional costs in the future that would have a negative effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations. Global cybersecurity threats and incidents can range from uncoordinated individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to information technology (IT) systems to sophisticated and targeted measures known as advanced persistent threats, directed at the Company, its products, its customers and/or its third party service providers, including cloud providers. Our customers, including the U.S. government, are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products, and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands. While we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, these types of threats and incidents, none of them to date have been material to the Company. We seek to deploy comprehensive measures to deter, prevent, detect, respond to and mitigate these threats, including identity and access controls, data protection, vulnerability assessments, product software designs which we believe are less susceptible to cyber attacks, continuous monitoring of our IT networks and systems and maintenance of backup and protective systems. Despite these efforts, cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in the misappropriation, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and the disruption of business operations. Cybersecurity incidents aimed at the software imbedded in our products could lead to third party claims that our product failures have caused a similar range of damages to our customers, and this risk is enhanced by the increasingly connected nature of our products. The potential consequences of a material cybersecurity incident include financial loss, reputational damage, litigation with third parties, theft of intellectual property, fines levied by the Federal Trade Commission, diminution in the value of our investment in research, development and engineering, and increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs due to the increasing sophistication and proliferation of threats, which in turn could adversely affect our competitiveness and results of operations. Data privacy, identity protection, and information security may require significant resources and presents certain risks. We collect, store, have access to and otherwise process certain confidential or sensitive data, including proprietary business information, personal data or other information that is subject to privacy and security laws, regulations and/or customer-imposed controls. Despite our efforts to protect such data, we may be vulnerable to material security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming errors, or employee errors that could potentially lead to the compromising of such data, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions. In addition, we operate in an environment in which there are different and potentially conflicting data privacy laws in effect in the various U.S. states and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and we must understand and comply with each law and standard in each of these jurisdictions while ensuring the data is secure. For example, the State of California recently passed legislation granting residents certain new data privacy rights and regulating the security of Internet of Things devices, which will go into effect in January 2020; European laws require us to have an approved legal mechanism to transfer personal data out of Europe; the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, which took effect in May 2018, superseded prior European Union data protection legislation and imposes more stringent requirements in how we collect and process personal data and provides for significantly greater penalties for noncompliance; and several other countries have passed laws that require personal data relating to their citizens to be maintained on local servers and impose additional data transfer restrictions. Government enforcement actions can be costly and interrupt the regular operation of our business, and violations of data privacy laws can result in fines, reputational damage and civil lawsuits, any of which may adversely affect our business, reputation and financial statements. 10 A material disruption of our operations, particularly at our manufacturing facilities or within our information technology infrastructure, could adversely affect our business. Our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems and information technology systems are subject to catastrophic loss due to natural disasters including hurricanes and floods, power outages, fires, explosions, terrorism, equipment failures, sabotage, adverse weather conditions, public health crises, labor disputes, critical supply failure, inaccurate downtime forecast, political disruption, and other reasons, which can result in undesirable consequences, including financial losses and damaged relationships with customers. We employ information technology systems and networks to support the business and rely on them to process, transmit and store electronic information, and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities. Disruptions to our information technology infrastructure from system failures, shutdowns, power outages, telecommunication or utility failures, and other events, including disruptions at our cloud computing, server, systems and other third party IT service providers, could interfere with our operations, interrupt production and shipments, damage customer and business partner relationships, and negatively impact our reputation. Legal and Regulatory Risks Our U.S. and non-U.S. tax liabilities are dependent, in part, upon the distribution of income among various jurisdictions in which we operate. Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in tax laws, regulations and judicial rulings (or changes in the interpretation thereof), potential expansion of taxation on digital services, changes in generally accepted accounting principles, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of earnings permanently reinvested offshore, the results of audits and examinations of previously filed tax returns and continuing assessments of our tax exposures and various other governmental enforcement initiatives. Our tax expense includes estimates of tax reserves and reflects other estimates and assumptions, including assessments of future earnings of the Company which could impact the valuation of our deferred tax assets. Changes in tax laws or regulations, including further regulatory developments arising from U.S. tax reform legislation as well as multi-jurisdictional changes enacted in response to the action items provided by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), will increase tax uncertainty and impact our provision for income taxes. Changes in legislation or government regulations or policies can have a significant impact on our results of operations. The sales and margins of each of our segments are directly impacted by government regulations including safety, performance and product certification regulations. Within Aerospace, the operating results of Commercial Original Equipment and Commercial Aftermarket may be impacted by, among other things, mandates of the Federal Aviation Administration and other similar international regulatory bodies requiring the installation of equipment on aircraft. Our Defense and Space business unit may be affected by changes in government procurement regulations. Within Honeywell Building Technologies, the demand for and cost of providing products, services and solutions can be impacted by fire, security, safety, health care, environmental and energy efficiency standards and regulations. Performance Materials and Technologies results of operations can be impacted by environmental standards, regulations, and judicial determinations . Growth in all our businesses within emerging markets may be adversely impacted by the inability to acquire and retain qualified employees where local employment law mandates may be restrictive. Noncompliance with legislation and regulations can result in fines and penalties. Increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in more international, regional and/or federal requirements to reduce or mitigate global warming and these regulations could mandate even more restrictive standards, such as stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions, than the voluntary commitments that the Company has made or require such changes on a more accelerated time frame. There continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which 11 creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. If environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the Company or its products, they could negatively impact the Companys business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters, government proceedings and other contingencies and uncertainties. We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employment, employee benefits plans, intellectual property, antitrust, accounting, import and export, and environmental, health and safety matters. Our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, and we may become subject to or be required to pay damage awards or settlements that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the total amount of all insured claims and liabilities. The incurrence of significant liabilities for which there is no or insufficient insurance coverage could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and financial condition. 12 Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments None Item 2. Properties We have approximately 991 locations, of which 252 are manufacturing sites. Our properties and equipment are in good operating condition and are adequate for our present needs. We do not anticipate difficulty in renewing existing leases as they expire or in finding alternative facilities. Item 3. Legal Proceedings We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and claims (some of which involve substantial amounts) arising out of the conduct of our business. See a discussion of environmental, asbestos and other litigation matters in Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures Not applicable. 13 Part II. Item 5. Market for Registrants Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Honeywells common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol HON. Dividend information for Honeywells common stock is included in Note 25 Unaudited Quarterly Financial Information of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The number of record holders of our common stock at December 31, 2018 was 45,606. Information regarding securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans is included in Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters under the caption Equity Compensation Plans. Honeywell purchased 11,181,042 shares of its common stock, par value $1 per share, in the quarter ending December 31, 2018. In December 2017, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to a total of $8 billion of Honeywell common stock, which included amounts remaining under and replaced the previously approved share repurchase program. $3.7 billion remained available as of as of December 31, 2018 for additional share repurchases. Honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to generally offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. Additionally, we seek to reduce share count via share repurchases as and when attractive opportunities arise. The amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and the level of our operating, financing and other investing activities. The following table summarizes Honeywells purchase of its common stock for the three months ended December 31, 2018: Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Price Paid per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet be Purchased Under Plans or Programs (Dollars in millions) October 2018 5,360,640 $ 156.75 5,360,640 $ 4,589 November 2018 4,810,000 $ 146.77 4,810,000 $ 3,883 December 2018 1,010,402 $ 143.62 1,010,402 $ 3,737 14 Performance Graph The following graph compares the five-year cumulative total return on our common stock to the total returns on the Standard & Poors (S&P) 500 Stock Index and a composite of S&Ps Industrial Conglomerates and Aerospace and Defense indices, on a 65%/35% weighted basis (the Composite Index). The weighting of the components of the Composite Index are based on our segments relative contribution to total segment profit. The selection of the Industrial Conglomerates component of the Composite Index reflects the diverse and distinct range of non-aerospace businesses conducted by Honeywell. The annual changes for the five-year period shown in the graph are based on the assumption that $100 had been invested in Honeywell stock and each index on December 31, 2013 and that all dividends were reinvested.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY During 2018, Honeywell continued to deliver on our financial commitments and to create long-term shareowner value. We grew net sales 3% to $41,802 million and grew income before taxes 8% to $7,487 million. The improvement in year over year income before taxes was attributable to both sales growth as well as operational improvements that increased operating margins. We believe our ability to consistently grow earnings derives from the consistent, rigorous deployment of the Honeywell Operating System as well as a long history of identifying and investing in productivity initiatives. We have continued our focus on commercial excellence processes, such as Velocity Product Development (VPD), to drive higher sales at better margins. We are careful not to allow the attainment of short-term financial results to imperil the creation of long-term, sustainable shareowner value. Hence, as part of the announcement in October 2017 of the results of our portfolio review, we affirmed our commitment to a strategy and investments that are intended to enable us to become one of the worlds leading software industrial companies. Our refocused strategy and investments are intended to take better advantage of our core technological and software strengths in high growth businesses that participate in six attractive industrial end markets. Each of these end markets is characterized by favorable global mega-trends including energy efficiency, infrastructure investment, urbanization and safety. 17 In 2018 we deployed capital of $7.6 billion, including the following:  Capital Investment we invested over $0.8 billion in capital expenditures focused on high return projects.  Dividends In 2018, we paid cash dividends of $2.3 billion and increased our annual dividend rate by 10%, as we seek to continue to grow the dividend in line with earnings. The dividend increase in September 2018 marked the ninth consecutive double-digit increase since 2010.  Share Repurchases we continue to repurchase our shares with the goal of keeping share count flat and by offsetting the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation and savings plans. Additionally, we seek to reduce share count via share repurchases as and when attractive opportunities arise. In 2018, we repurchased 26.5 million shares for $4.0 billion.  Mergers and Acquisitions we deployed approximately $0.5 billion during 2018 on acquisitions. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Sales 2018 2017 2016 Net sales $ 41,802 $ 40,534 $ 39,302 % change compared with prior period 3 % 3 % The change in net sales is attributable to the following: 2018 Versus 2017 2017 Versus 2016 Volume 4% 3% Price 2% 1% Acquisitions/Divestitures (4)% (1)% Foreign Currency Translation 1% 0% 3% 3% A discussion of net sales by segment can be found in the Review of Business Segments section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis. The foreign currency translation impact in 2018 compared with 2017 was principally driven by the strengthening on average year over year of the Euro against the U.S. Dollar. The foreign currency translation impact in 2017 compared with 2016 was flat. The strengthening of the Euro was offset by the weakening of the British Pound against the U.S. Dollar. Cost of Products and Services Sold 2018 2017 2016 Cost of products and services sold $ 29,046 $ 28,144 $ 27,677 % change compared with prior period 3 % 2 % Gross Margin percentage 30.5 % 30.6 % 29.6 % Cost of products and services sold increased in 2018 compared with 2017 principally due to increased direct material costs of approximately $790 million (driven by higher sales volume and inflation partially offset by divestitures and productivity) and higher repositioning and other charges of approximately $70 million. Gross margin percentage decreased in 2018 compared with 2017 principally due to higher repositioning and other charges (approximately 0.2 percentage point impact) partially offset by higher gross margin in the segments (approximately 0.1 percentage point impact collectively). Cost of products and services sold increased in 2017 compared with 2016 principally due to increased direct material costs of approximately $290 million (driven by higher sales volume and acquisitions partially offset by divestitures and productivity, net of inflation), higher repositioning and 18 other charges of approximately $220 million and higher depreciation and amortization of approximately $90 million, partially offset by decreased indirect material costs of approximately $70 million and lower labor costs of approximately $60 million. Gross margin percentage increased in 2017 compared with 2016 principally due to higher gross margin in Aerospace and Performance Materials and Technologies (approximately 1.7 percentage point impact collectively), partially offset by higher repositioning and other charges (approximately 0.5 percentage point impact) and by lower gross margin in Home and Building Solutions and Safety and Productivity Solutions (approximately 0.3 percentage point impact collectively). Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 2018 2017 2016 Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 6,051 $ 6,087 $ 5,574 % of sales 14.5 % 15.0 % 14.2 % Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily due to productivity and divestiture impacts, partially offset by labor inflation and higher repositioning charges. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to increased labor costs (driven primarily by acquisitions, net of divestitures, investment for growth and merit increases), and higher repositioning charges. Other (Income) Expense 2018 2017 2016 Other (income) expense $ (1,149 ) $ (963 ) $ (739 ) Other (income) expense increased in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily due to an increase in pension ongoing incomenon-service, favorable impacts of foreign currency and an increase in interest income, partially offset by separation costs associated with the spin-offs of our Homes and Global Distribution business and Transportation Systems business. Other (income) expense increased in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily due to due to an increase in pension ongoing incomenon-service. Tax Expense 2018 2017 2016 Tax expense $ 659 $ 5,362 $ 1,603 Effective tax rate 8.8 % 77.2 % 24.8 % The effective tax rate for 2018 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily attributable to internal restructuring initiatives that resulted in a reduction of accrued withholding taxes of approximately $1.1 billion related to unremitted foreign earnings. In addition, we recorded a tax benefit of approximately $440 million as a reduction to our 2017 provisional estimate of impacts from what is commonly referred to as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (U.S. Tax Reform), which was partially offset by $411 million of tax costs associated with the internal restructuring of the Homes and Global Distribution business and the Transportation Systems business in advance of their spin-offs. The effective tax rate for 2017 was higher than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily from the estimated impacts of U.S. Tax Reform of approximately $3.8 billion, partially offset by lower tax rates on non-U.S. earnings. The effective tax rate for 2016 was lower than the U.S. federal statutory rate of 35% primarily from lower tax rates on non-U.S. earnings. For further discussion of changes in the effective tax rate, see Note 5 Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 19 Net Income Attributable to Honeywell 2018 2017 2016 Net income attributable to Honeywell $ 6,765 $ 1,545 $ 4,812 Earnings per share of common stockassuming dilution $ 8.98 $ 2.00 $ 6.21 Earnings per share of common stockassuming dilution increased in 2018 compared with 2017 primarily driven by the lower income tax expenses (due to reduction of accrued withholding taxes and the higher comparative income taxes in 2017 from U.S. Tax Reform), higher segment profit, increased pension and other postretirement income, and lower share count, partially offset by separation costs and higher repositioning and other charges. Earnings per share of common stockassuming dilution decreased in 2017 compared with 2016 primarily driven by additional income tax expense from U.S. Tax Reform, higher repositioning and other charges, partially offset by higher segment profit across all segments, lower pension mark-to-market expense and increased pension and other postretirement income. BUSINESS OVERVIEW Our consolidated results are principally impacted by:  Changes in global economic growth rates and industry conditions and demand in our key end markets;  The impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates (in particular the Euro), relative to the U.S. Dollar;  The extent to which cost savings from productivity actions are able to offset or exceed the impact of material and non-material inflation;  The spin-offs of the Homes and Global Distribution business and the Transportation Systems business into two stand-alone, publicly-traded companies and the associated separation costs;  The impact of the pension discount rate and asset returns on pension expense, including mark-to-market adjustments, and funding requirements; and  The impact of U.S. Tax Reform. Our 2019 areas of focus, most of which are applicable to each of our segments include:  Driving profitable growth through research and development and technological excellence to deliver innovative products that customers value, and through expansion and localization of our footprint in high growth regions;  Executing on our strategy to become a software-industrial company, which for us means products and services that facilitate the connected plane, building and factory;  Expanding margins by optimizing the Companys cost structure through manufacturing and administrative process improvements, repositioning, and other productivity actions;  Executing disciplined, rigorous M&A and integration processes to deliver growth through acquisitions;  Controlling corporate costs, including costs incurred for asbestos and environmental matters, pension and other post-retirement benefits; and  Increasing availability of capital through strong cash flow conversion from effective working capital management and proactively managing debt levels to enable the Company to smartly deploy capital for strategic acquisitions, dividends, share repurchases and capital expenditures. 20 Review of Business Segments Years Ended December 31, % Change 2018 Versus 2017 2017 Versus 2016 2018 2017 2016 Aerospace Sales Commercial Aviation Original Equipment $ 2,833 $ 2,475 $ 2,525 14 % (2 )% Commercial Aviation Aftermarket 5,373 5,103 4,796 5 % 6 % Defense and Space 4,665 4,053 4,375 15 % (7 )% Transportation Systems 2,622 3,148 3,055 (17 )% 3 % Total Aerospace Sales 15,493 14,779 14,751 Honeywell Building Technologies Sales Homes 3,928 4,482 4,405 (12 )% 2 % Buildings 5,370 5,295 5,085 1 % 4 % Total Honeywell Building Technologies Sales 9,298 9,777 9,490 Performance Materials and Technologies Sales UOP 2,845 2,753 2,469 3 % 12 % Process Solutions 4,981 4,795 4,640 4 % 3 % Advanced Materials 2,848 2,791 3,327 2 % (16 )% Total Performance Materials and Technologies Sales 10,674 10,339 10,436 Safety and Productivity Solutions Sales Safety 2,278 2,169 2,075 5 % 5 % Productivity Solutions 4,059 3,470 2,550 17 % 36 % Total Safety and Productivity Solutions Sales 6,337 5,639 4,625 Net Sales $ 41,802 $ 40,534 $ 39,302 Aerospace 2018 2017 Change 2016 Change Net sales $ 15,493 $ 14,779 5 % $ 14,751  Cost of products and services sold 10,837 10,320 10,820 Selling, general and administrative and other expenses 1,153 1,171 940 Segment profit $ 3,503 $ 3,288 7 % $ 2,991 10 % Factors Contributing to Year-Over-Year Change 2018 vs. 2017 2017 vs. 2016 Sales Segment Profit Sales Segment Profit Organic growth/ Operational segment profit 9 % 9 % 2 % 11 % Foreign currency translation 1 % 1 %   Acquisitions, divestitures and other, net (5 )% (3 )% (2 )% (1 )% Total % Change 5 % 7 %  10 % 2018 compared with 2017 Aerospace sales increased due to organic sales growth, due to both volume and price, the favorable impact of foreign currency translation, the impact of the adoption of the new revenue 21 recognition accounting standard (included within Acquisitions, divestitures and other, net in the table above), offset by the spin-off of the Transportation Systems business on October 1, 2018.  Commercial Original Equipment sales increased 14% (increased 11% organic) primarily due to increased demand from business aviation, and air transport and regional original equipment manufacturers (OEM), lower OEM incentives and the impact from the classification of nonrecurring engineering and development funding resulting from the adoption of the new revenue recognition accounting standard.  Commercial Aftermarket sales increased 5% (increased 5% organic) primarily due to growth in business aviation and air transport and regional.  Defense and Space sales increased 15% (increased 15% organic) primarily driven by growth in U.S. and international defense.  Transportation Systems sales decreased 17% driven by divestiture impacts following its October 1, 2018 spin-off.

Repositioning Charges See Note 3 Repositioning and Other Charges of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our repositioning actions and related charges incurred in 2018, 2017 and 2016. Cash spending related to our repositioning actions was $285 million, $177 million and $228 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, and was funded through operating cash flows. In 2019, we expect cash spending for repositioning actions to be approximately $300 million and to be funded through operating cash flows. 25 LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company continues to manage its businesses to maximize operating cash flows as the primary source of liquidity. In addition to our available cash and operating cash flows, additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short-term debt from the commercial paper market, long-term borrowings, access to the public debt and equity markets and the ability to access non-U.S. cash as a result of the U.S. Tax Reform. We continue to balance our cash and financing uses through investment in our existing core businesses, acquisition activity, share repurchases and dividends. Cash Flow Summary Our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, are summarized as follows: Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Cash provided by (used for): Operating activities $ 6,434 $ 5,966 $ 5,498 Investing activities 1,027 (3,574 ) (3,342 ) Financing activities (5,032 ) (3,516 ) 346 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (201 ) 340 (114 ) Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 2,228 $ (784 ) $ 2,388 2018 compared with 2017 Cash provided by operating activities increased by $468 million primarily due to a $239 million increase in customer advances and deferred income and lower cash tax payments of $185 million. Cash provided by investing activities increased by $4,601 million primarily due to a net $4,302 million decrease in investments, primarily short-term marketable securities, and a $620 million favorable change in settlements of foreign currency exchange contracts used as economic hedges on certain non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities, partially offset by an increase in cash paid for acquisitions of $453 million. Cash used for financing activities increased by $1,516 million primarily due to an increase in net debt payments of $2,622 million, an increase in net repurchases of common stock of $1,364 million and an increase in cash dividends paid of $153 million, partially offset by net spin separation funding of $2,622 million net of spin-off cash. 2017 compared with 2016 Cash provided by operating activities increased by $468 million primarily due to a $504 million increase in segment profit and a $294 million favorable impact from working capital (favorable accounts payable partially offset by inventory and accounts receivable), partially offset by higher cash tax payments of $609 million. Cash used for investing activities increased by $232 million primarily due to (i) a net $2,056 million increase in investments, primarily short-term marketable securities, (ii) an increase of $500 million of settlement payments of foreign currency exchange contracts used as economic hedges on certain non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and (iii) a decrease in proceeds from the sales of businesses of $296 million (most significantly Honeywell Technology Solutions Inc. in 2016), partially offset by a decrease in cash paid for acquisitions of $2,491 million (most significantly Intelligrated in 2016). Cash provided by financing activities increased by $3,862 million primarily due to a decrease in the net proceeds from debt issuances of $2,827 million, an increase in net repurchases of common stock of $699 million and an increase in cash dividends paid of $204 million. 26 Liquidity Each of our businesses is focused on implementing strategies to increase operating cash flows through revenue growth, margin expansion and improved working capital turnover. Considering the current economic environment in which each of the businesses operate and their business plans and strategies, including the focus on growth, cost reduction and productivity initiatives, we believe that cash balances and operating cash flow will continue to be our principal source of liquidity. In addition to the available cash and operating cash flows, additional sources of liquidity include committed credit lines, short-term debt from the commercial paper markets, long-term borrowings, and access to the public debt and equity markets. To date, the Company has not experienced any limitations in our ability to access these sources of liquidity. We monitor the third-party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a daily basis. Our emphasis is primarily safety of principal and secondarily maximizing yield of those funds. We diversify our cash and cash equivalents among counterparties to minimize exposure to any one of these entities. A source of liquidity is our ability to issue short-term debt in the commercial paper market. Commercial paper notes are sold at a discount or premium and have a maturity of not more than 365 days from date of issuance. Borrowings under the commercial paper program are available for general corporate purposes as well as for financing acquisitions. The weighted average interest rate on short-term borrowings and commercial paper outstanding as of December 31, 2018 was (0.31%) and as of December 31, 2017 was (0.17%). Our ability to access the commercial paper market, and the related cost of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of our credit rating and market conditions. Our credit ratings are periodically reviewed by the major independent debt-rating agencies. As of December 31, 2018, Standard and Poors (S&P), Fitch, and Moodys have ratings on our long-term debt of A, A and A2 and short-term debt of A-1, F1 and P1. S&P, Fitch and Moodys have Honeywells rating outlook as stable. We also have a current shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission under which we may issue additional debt securities, common stock and preferred stock that may be offered in one or more offerings on terms to be determined at the time of the offering. Net proceeds of any offering would be used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of existing indebtedness, share repurchases, capital expenditures and acquisitions. See Note 2 Acquisitions and Divestitures and Note 13 Long-term Debt and Credit Agreements of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of items impacting our liquidity. In 2018, the Company repurchased $4,000 million of outstanding shares to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans, and to reduce share count when attractive opportunities arise. In December 2017, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to a total of $8 billion of Honeywell common stock, of which $3.7 billion remained available as of December 31, 2018 for additional share repurchases. This authorization included amounts remaining under and replaced the previously approved share repurchase program. Honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. We will continue to seek to reduce share count via share repurchases as and when attractive opportunities arise. In addition to our normal operating cash requirements, our principal future cash requirements will be to fund capital expenditures, share repurchases, dividends, strategic acquisitions and debt repayments. Specifically, we expect our primary cash requirements in 2019 to be as follows:  Capital expenditureswe expect to spend approximately $800 million for capital expenditures in 2019 primarily for growth, production and capacity expansion, cost reduction, maintenance, and replacement. 27  Share repurchasesunder the Companys share repurchase program, $3.7 billion is available as of December 31, 2018 for additional share repurchases. Honeywell presently expects to repurchase outstanding shares from time to time to offset the dilutive impact of employee stock-based compensation plans, including option exercises, restricted unit vesting and matching contributions under our savings plans. Additionally, we will seek to reduce share count via share repurchases as and when attractive opportunities arise. The amount and timing of future repurchases may vary depending on market conditions and our level of operating, financing and other investing activities.  Dividendswe increased our quarterly dividend rate by 10% to $0.82 per share of common stock effective with the fourth quarter 2018 dividend. The Company intends to continue to pay quarterly dividends in 2019. We continuously assess the relative strength of each business in our portfolio as to strategic fit, market position, profit and cash flow contribution in order to upgrade our combined portfolio and identify business units that will most benefit from increased investment. We identify acquisition candidates that will further our strategic plan and strengthen our existing core businesses. We also identify businesses that do not fit into our long-term strategic plan based on their market position, relative profitability or growth potential. These businesses are considered for potential divestiture, restructuring or other repositioning actions subject to regulatory constraints. In 2018, we realized $2,622 million in net cash proceeds from the spin-off of non-strategic businesses. Based on past performance and current expectations, we believe that our operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our future operating cash needs. Our available cash, committed credit lines and access to the public debt and equity markets, provide additional sources of short-term and long-term liquidity to fund current operations, debt maturities, and future investment opportunities. Contractual Obligations and Probable Liability Payments Following is a summary of our significant contractual obligations and probable liability payments at December 31, 2018: Total (6)(7) Payments by Period Thereafter 2019 2020- 2021 2022- 2023 Long-term debt, including capitalized leases (1) $ 12,628 $ 2,872 $ 3,761 $ 1,778 $ 4,217 Interest payments on long-term debt, including capitalized leases 3,049 313 519 389 1,828 Minimum operating lease payments 856 210 310 189 147 Purchase obligations (2) 2,002 1,146 578 250 28 Estimated environmental liability payments (3) 755 175 355 172 53 Asbestos related liability payments (4) 2,514 245 786 710 773 Asbestos insurance recoveries (5) (477 ) (40 ) (114 ) (84 ) (239 ) $ 21,327 $ 4,921 $ 6,195 $ 3,404 $ 6,807 (1) Assumes all long-term debt is outstanding until scheduled maturity. (2) Purchase obligations are entered into with various vendors in the normal course of business and are consistent with our expected requirements. (3) The payment amounts in the table only reflect the environmental liabilities which are probable and reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2018. (4) These amounts are estimates of asbestos related cash payments for NARCO and Bendix based on our asbestos related liabilities which are probable and reasonably estimable as of December 31, 2018. See Asbestos Matters in Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 28 (5) These amounts represent our insurance recoveries that are deemed probable for asbestos related liabilities as of December 31, 2018. See Asbestos Matters in Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (6) The table excludes tax liability payments, including those for unrecognized tax benefits. See Note 5 Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. (7) The table excludes expected proceeds from the indemnification and reimbursement agreements entered into with Garrett and Resideo. See Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Environmental Matters Accruals for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable were $395 million, $287 million and $195 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016. In addition, in 2018, 2017 and 2016 we incurred operating costs for ongoing businesses of approximately $95 million, $82 million and $83 million relating to compliance with environmental regulations. Spending related to known environmental matters was $218 million, $212 million and $228 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016 and is estimated to be approximately $175 million in 2019. We expect to fund expenditures for these environmental matters from operating cash flow. The timing of cash expenditures depends on several factors, including the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, execution timeframe of projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreement with other parties. Reimbursements from Resideo for spending for environmental matters at certain sites as defined in the indemnification and reimbursement agreement was $25 million in 2018 and is expected to be $140 million in 2019. Such reimbursements will offset operating cash outflows incurred by the Company. See Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our environmental matters and the indemnification and reimbursement agreement entered into with Resideo. Financial Instruments The following table illustrates the potential change in fair value for interest rate sensitive instruments based on a hypothetical immediate one percentage point increase in interest rates across all maturities and the potential change in fair value for foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments based on a 10% weakening of the U.S. Dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities at December 31, 2018 and 2017. Face or Notional Amount Carrying Value (1) Fair Value (1) Estimated Increase (Decrease) in Fair Value (2) December 31, 2018 Interest Rate Sensitive Instruments Long-term debt (including current maturities) $ 12,628 $ (12,628 ) $ (13,133 ) $ (654 ) Interest rate swap agreements 2,600 (45 ) (45 ) (83 ) Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitive Instruments Foreign currency exchange contracts (3) 14,995 115 115 (742 ) Cross currency swap agreements 1,200 32 32 (117 ) December 31, 2017 Interest Rate Sensitive Instruments Long-term debt (including current maturities) $ 13,924 $ (13,924 ) $ (14,695 ) $ (782 ) Interest rate swap agreements 2,600 (8 ) (8 ) (233 ) Foreign Exchange Rate Sensitive Instruments Foreign currency exchange contracts (3) 9,273 (53 ) (53 ) (58 ) 29 (1) Asset or (liability). (2) A hypothetical immediate one percentage point decrease in interest rates across all maturities and a potential change in fair value of foreign exchange rate sensitive instruments based on a 10% strengthening of the U.S. dollar versus local currency exchange rates across all maturities will result in a change in fair value approximately equal to the inverse of the amount disclosed in the table. (3) Changes in the fair value of foreign currency exchange contracts are offset by changes in the fair value, cash flows, or net investments of underlying hedged foreign currency transactions or foreign operations. See Note 15 Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on the agreements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is based on the selection and application of accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. We consider the accounting policies discussed below to be critical to the understanding of our financial statements. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Contingent Liabilities We are subject to a number of lawsuits, investigations and claims (some of which involve substantial dollar amounts) that arise out of the conduct of our global business operations or those of previously owned entities, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability (including asbestos), prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, legal and environmental, health and safety matters. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on a thorough analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Such analysis includes making judgments concerning matters such as the costs associated with environmental matters, the outcome of negotiations, the number and cost of pending and future asbestos claims, and the impact of evidentiary requirements. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, liabilities may change in the future due to new developments (including new discovery of facts, changes in legislation and outcomes of similar cases through the judicial system), changes in assumptions or changes in our settlement strategy. See Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of managements judgment applied in the recognition and measurement of our environmental and asbestos liabilities which represent our most significant contingencies. Asbestos Related Liabilities and Insurance Recoveries, and Indemnification Receivables Honeywells involvement in asbestos related personal injury actions relates to two predecessor companies. Regarding North American Refractories Company (NARCO) asbestos related claims, we accrued for pending claims based on terms and conditions in agreements with NARCO, its former parent company, and certain asbestos claimants, and an estimate of the unsettled claims pending as of the time NARCO filed for bankruptcy protection. We also accrued for the estimated value of future NARCO asbestos related claims expected to be asserted against the NARCO Trust. The estimate of future NARCO claims was prepared in 2002, in the same year NARCO filed for bankruptcy protection, using NARCO tort system litigation experience based on a commonly accepted methodology used by numerous bankruptcy courts addressing 524(g) trusts. Accordingly, the estimated value of future NARCO asbestos claims was prepared before there was data on claims filings and payment rates in the NARCO Trust under the Trust Distribution Procedures and prepared when the stay of all NARCO asbestos claims was in effect (which remained in effect until NARCO emerged from Bankruptcy protection). Some critical assumptions underlying this commonly accepted methodology included claims filing rates, disease criteria and payment values contained in the Trust Distribution Procedures, 30 estimated approval rates of claims submitted to the NARCO Trust and epidemiological studies estimating disease instances. This estimate resulted in a range of estimated liability of $743 million to $961 million. We believe that no amount within this range is a better estimate than any other amount and accordingly, we have recorded the minimum amount in the range. Given the Trusts lack of sufficiently reliable claims data since NARCO emerged from bankruptcy protection, it is not yet possible to update our estimated future claim costs based on actual NARCO Trust experience. Regarding Bendix Friction Materials (Bendix) asbestos related claims, we accrued for the estimated value of pending claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. We also accrued for the estimated value of future claims related to Bendix over the full term of epidemiological projections through 2059 based on historic and anticipated claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and average resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. In connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. In assessing the probability of insurance recovery, we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers. While the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. Projecting future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded. Given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections, we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries considering any changes to the projected liability, our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries. Additionally, in conjunction with the Garrett spin-off, the Company entered into an indemnification and reimbursement agreement with a Garrett subsidiary, pursuant to which Garretts subsidiary has an obligation to make cash payments to Honeywell as reimbursement for asbestos liabilities. Accordingly, the Company has recorded an indemnification receivable and we monitor the recoverability of such receivable, which is subject to terms of applicable credit agreements of Garrett and its general ability to pay. See Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of managements judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of our asbestos-related liabilities and related insurance recoveries, and additional details regarding the indemnification and reimbursement agreement. Defined Benefit Pension Plans We sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. For financial reporting purposes, net periodic pension (income) expense is calculated annually based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate for plan obligations and an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Changes in the discount rate and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets could materially affect the annual pension (income) expense amount. Annual pension (income) expense is comprised of service and interest cost, assumed return on plan assets, prior service amortization (Pension Ongoing (Income) Expense) and a potential mark-to-market adjustment (MTM Adjustment). The key assumptions used in developing our 2018, 2017 and 2016 net periodic pension (income) expense for our U.S. plans included the following: 2018 2017 2016 Discount Rate: Projected benefit obligation 3.68 % 4.20 % 4.46 % Service cost 3.77 % 4.42 % 4.69 % Interest cost 3.27 % 3.49 % 3.59 % Assets: Expected rate of return 7.75 % 7.75 % 7.75 % Actual rate of return -1.8 % 20.5 % 9.7 % Actual 10 year average annual compounded rate of return 11.0 % 7.4 % 6.4 % 31 The MTM Adjustment represents the recognition of net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligation (the corridor). Net actuarial gains and losses occur when the actual experience differs from any of the various assumptions used to value our pension plans or when assumptions change. The primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses are changes in the discount rate used to value pension obligations as of the measurement date each year and the difference between expected and actual returns on plan assets. The mark-to-market accounting method results in the potential for volatile and difficult to forecast MTM Adjustments. MTM charges were $37 million, $87 million and $273 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016. We determine the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets utilizing historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with our expectations of future market conditions and asset mix considerations (see Note 21 Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for details on the actual various asset classes and targeted asset allocation percentages for our pension plans). We plan to use an expected rate of return on plan assets of 6.75% for 2019 down from 7.75% for 2018 reflecting a re-balancing of assets to more fixed income during 2018. The discount rate reflects the market rate on December 31 (measurement date) for high-quality fixed-income investments with maturities corresponding to our benefit obligations and is subject to change each year. The discount rate can be volatile from year to year as it is determined based upon prevailing interest rates as of the measurement date. We used a 4.35% discount rate to determine benefit obligations as of December 31, 2018, reflecting the increase in the market interest rate environment since the prior year-end. In addition to the potential for MTM Adjustments, changes in our expected rate of return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from economic events also affects future pension ongoing (income) expense. The following table highlights the sensitivity of our U.S. pension obligations and ongoing (income) expense to changes in these assumptions, assuming all other assumptions remain constant. These estimates exclude any potential MTM Adjustment: Change in Assumption Impact on 2019 Pension Ongoing Expense Impact on PBO 0.25 percentage point decrease in discount rate Decrease $20 million Increase $420 million 0.25 percentage point increase in discount rate Increase $20 million Decrease $410 million 0.25 percentage point decrease in expected rate of return on assets Increase $41 million  0.25 percentage point increase in expected rate of return on assets Decrease $41 million  Pension ongoing income for our world-wide pension plans is expected to be approximately $590 million in 2019 compared with pension ongoing income of $992 million in 2018. The expected decrease in pension income is primarily due to lower actual asset returns in 2018 and a lower expected return on asset assumption for 2019 in our U.S. and UK plans. Also, if required, an MTM Adjustment will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019 in accordance with our pension accounting method as previously described. It is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be a MTM Adjustment in 2019, and if one is required, what the magnitude of such adjustment will be. MTM Adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond the control of the Company such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets. Long-Lived Assets (including Tangible and Finite-Lived Intangible Assets) The determination of useful lives (for depreciation/amortization purposes) and whether or not tangible and intangible assets are impaired involves the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of our long-lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group may not be fully recoverable. The principal factors in considering when to perform an impairment review are as follows: 32  Significant under-performance (i.e., declines in sales, earnings or cash flows) of a business or product line in relation to expectations;  Annual operating plans or strategic plan outlook that indicate an unfavorable trend in operating performance of a business or product line;  Significant negative industry or economic trends; or  Significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets. Once it is determined that an impairment review is necessary, recoverability of assets is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. The impairment is then measured as the difference between the carrying amount of the asset grouping and its fair value. We endeavor to utilize the best information available to measure fair value, which is usually either market prices (if available), level 1 or level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, or an estimate of the future discounted cash flow, level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The key estimates in our discounted cash flow analysis include assumptions as to expected industry and business growth rates, sales volume, selling prices and costs, cash flows, and the discount rate selected. These estimates are subject to changes in the economic environment, including market interest rates and expected volatility. Management believes the estimates of future cash flows and fair values are reasonable; however, changes in estimates due to variance from assumptions could materially affect the valuations. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Impairment Testing Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual, or more frequent if necessary, impairment testing. In testing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair value is estimated utilizing a discounted cash flow approach utilizing cash flow forecasts in our five year strategic and annual operating plans adjusted for terminal value assumptions. These impairment tests involve the use of accounting estimates and assumptions, changes in which could materially impact our financial condition or operating performance if actual results differ from such estimates and assumptions. To address this uncertainty we perform sensitivity analysis on key estimates and assumptions. Income Taxes On a recurring basis, we assess the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets by considering all available positive and negative evidence, such as past operating results, projections of future taxable income, enacted tax law changes and the feasibility and impact of tax planning initiatives. Our projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume, pricing and costs, as well as the timing and amount of reversals of taxable temporary differences. For further discussion of additional income tax policies and provision items recorded in regards to U.S Tax Reform, see Note 1 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 5 Income Taxes of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Sales Recognition on Long-Term Contracts We recognize sales for long-term contracts with performance obligations satisfied over time using either an input or output method. We recognize revenue over time as we perform on these contracts based on the continuous transfer of control to the customer. With control transferring over time, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. We generally use the cost-to-cost input method of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as we incur costs. Under the cost-to-cost method, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the proportion of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of our performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion requires judgment. Contract revenues are largely determined by negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). Cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends and other economic projections. Significant factors that influence these estimates 33 include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. Revenue and cost estimates are regularly monitored and revised based on changes in circumstances. Impacts from changes in estimates of net sales and cost of sales are recognized on a cumulative catch-up basis, which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a performance obligations percentage of completion. Anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recognized when such losses become evident. We maintain financial controls over the customer qualification, contract pricing and estimation processes to reduce the risk of contract losses. 34 OTHER MATTERS Litigation See Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of environmental, asbestos and other litigation matters.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Accounting Principles The financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The following is a description of Honeywells significant accounting policies. Principles of Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Honeywell International Inc. and all of its subsidiaries and entities in which a controlling interest is maintained. Our consolidation policy requires equity investments that we exercise significant influence over but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the investees activities to be accounted for using the equity method. Investments through which we are not able to exercise significant influence over the investee and which we do not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method. All intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including any asset retirement obligations, less accumulated depreciation. For financial reporting, the straight-line method of depreciation is used over the estimated useful lives of 10 to 50 years for buildings and improvements and 2 to 16 years for machinery and equipment. Recognition of the fair value of obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets is required when there is a legal obligation to incur such costs. Upon initial recognition of a liability, the cost is capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the corresponding assets useful life. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are subject to impairment testing annually as of March 31, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable. This testing compares carrying values to fair values and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value. We completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of March 31, 2018 and determined that there was no impairment as of that date. Other Intangible Assets with Determinable Lives Other intangible assets with determinable lives consist of customer lists, technology, patents and trademarks and other intangibles and are amortized over their estimated useful lives, ranging from 2 to 24 years. Sales Recognition Product and service sales are recognized when or as we transfer control of the promised products or services to our customer. Revenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods or providing services. Service sales, principally representing repair, maintenance and engineering activities are recognized over the contractual period or as services are rendered. Sales under long-term contracts with performance obligations satisfied over time are recognized using either an input or output method. We recognize revenue over time as we perform on these contracts because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer. With control transferring over time, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. We generally use the cost-to-cost input method of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as we incur costs. Under the cost-to-cost method, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the proportion of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. We review our cost estimates on significant contracts on a periodic basis, or when circumstances change and warrant a modification to a previous estimate. Cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends and other economic projections. Significant factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements. Provisions for anticipated losses on long-term contracts are recorded in full when such losses become evident, to the extent required. 41 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) The customer funding for costs incurred for nonrecurring engineering and development activities of our products under agreements with commercial customers is deferred and subsequently recognized as revenue as products are delivered to the customers. Additionally, expenses incurred, up to the customer agreed funded amount, are deferred as an asset and recognized as cost of sales when products are delivered to the customer. The deferred customer funding and costs result in recognition of deferred costs (asset) and deferred revenue (liability) on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Revenues for our mechanical service programs are recognized as performance obligations are satisfied over time, with recognition reflecting a series of distinct services using the output method. The terms of a contract or the historical business practice can give rise to variable consideration due to, but not limited to, cash-based incentives, rebates, performance awards, or credits. We estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount we will receive from customers. We include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized for such transaction will not occur, or when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Our estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of our anticipated performance and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us. For the years ended 2017 and 2016, prior to the adoption of the revenue recognition standard (see Note 7 Revenue Recognition and Contracts with Customers), product and service sales were recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement existed, product delivery had occurred or services had been rendered, pricing was fixed or determinable, and collection was reasonably assured. Service sales, principally representing repair, maintenance and engineering activities were recognized over the contractual period or as services were rendered. Sales under long-term contracts were recorded on a percentage-of-completion method measured on the cost-to-cost basis for engineering-type contracts and the units-of-delivery basis for production-type contracts. Provisions for anticipated losses on long-term contracts were recorded in full when such losses became evident. Revenues from contracts with multiple element arrangements were recognized as each element was earned based on the relative fair value of each element provided the delivered elements had value to customers on a standalone basis. Amounts allocated to each element were based on its objectively determined fair value, such as the sales price for the product or service when it was sold separately or competitor prices for similar products or services. Environmental We accrue costs related to environmental matters when it is probable that we have incurred a liability related to a contaminated site and the amount can be reasonably estimated. For additional information, see Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies. Asbestos Related Liabilities and Insurance Recoveries, and Indemnification Receivables We recognize a liability for any asbestos related contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. In connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos related matters, we record asbestos related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. Additionally, in conjunction with the Garrett spin-off, the Company entered into an indemnification and reimbursement agreement with a Garrett subsidiary, pursuant to which Garretts subsidiary has an obligation to make cash payments to Honeywell as reimbursement for asbestos liabilities. Accordingly, the Company has recorded an indemnification receivable and we monitor the recoverability of such receivable, which is subject to terms of applicable credit agreements of Garrett and its general ability to pay. For additional information, see Note 20 Commitments and Contingencies. Aerospace Sales Incentives We provide sales incentives to commercial aircraft manufacturers and airlines in connection with their selection of our aircraft equipment, predominately wheel and braking system hardware, avionics, and auxiliary power units, for installation on commercial aircraft. These incentives consist of free or deeply discounted products, credits for future purchases of product or upfront cash payments. These costs are generally recognized in the period incurred as cost of products sold or as a reduction to relevant sales, as appropriate. 42 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Research and Development Research and development costs for company-sponsored research and development projects are expensed as incurred. Such costs are principally included in cost of products sold and were $1,809 million, $1,835 million and $1,864 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016. Stock-Based Compensation Plans The principal awards issued under our stock-based compensation plans, which are described in Note 19 Stock-Based Compensation Plans, are non-qualified stock options and restricted stock units. The cost for such awards is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award. The value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods (generally the vesting period of the equity award) and is included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant to recognize expense for those awards that are expected to vest and are based on our historical forfeiture rates. Pension Benefits On January 1, 2018, we retrospectively adopted the new accounting guidance on presentation of net periodic pension costs. That guidance requires that we disaggregate the service cost component of net benefit costs and report those costs in the same line item or items in the Consolidated Statement of Operations as other compensation costs arising from services rendered by the pertinent employees during the period. The other non-service components of net benefit costs are required to be presented separately from the service cost component. Following the adoption of this guidance, we continue to record the service cost component of Pension ongoing (income) expense in Costs of products and services sold and Selling, general and administrative expenses. The remaining components of net benefit costs within Pension ongoing (income) expense, primarily interest costs and assumed return on plan assets, are now recorded in Other (income) expense. See Note 4 Other (Income) Expense for amounts that were reclassified. We will continue to recognize net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans projected benefit obligation (the corridor) annually in the fourth quarter each year (MTM Adjustment). The MTM Adjustment will also be reported in Other (income) expense. Foreign Currency Translation Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries operating outside the United States with a functional currency other than U.S. Dollars are translated into U.S. Dollars using year-end exchange rates. Sales, costs and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates in effect during the year. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). For subsidiaries operating in highly inflationary environments, inventories and property, plant and equipment, including related expenses, are remeasured at the exchange rate in effect on the date the assets were acquired, while monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured at year-end exchange rates. Remeasurement adjustments for these subsidiaries are included in earnings. Derivative Financial Instruments We minimize our risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through our normal operating and financing activities and, when deemed appropriate through the use of derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments are used to manage risk and are not used for trading or other speculative purposes. We do not use leveraged derivative financial instruments. Derivative financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting must be designated and effective as a hedge of the identified risk exposure at the inception of the contract. Accordingly, changes in fair value of the derivative contract must be highly correlated with changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item at inception of the hedge and over the life of the hedge contract. All derivatives are recorded on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. For derivatives designated as hedges of the fair value of assets or liabilities, the changes in fair values of both the derivatives and the hedged items are recorded in current earnings. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the derivatives are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged items impact earnings. Cash flows of such derivative financial instruments are 43 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) classified consistent with the underlying hedged item. We have elected to exclude the time value of the derivatives (i.e., the forward points) from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize the initial value of the excluded component in earnings using the amortization approach. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a net investment hedge, the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is reported as a component of Other comprehensive income (loss) and recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). The gain or loss will be subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. Income Taxes Significant judgment is required in evaluating tax positions. We establish additional reserves for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum recognition threshold. The approach for evaluating certain and uncertain tax positions is defined by the authoritative guidance which determines when a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. In the normal course of business, the Company and its subsidiaries are examined by various federal, state and foreign tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a change in estimate become known. For discussion of the impacts from what is commonly referred to as the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (U.S Tax Reform), see Note 5 Income Taxes. Cash and cash equivalents Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and highly liquid investments having an original maturity of three months or less. Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and all dilutive potential common shares outstanding. Reclassifications Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Recent Accounting Pronouncements We consider the applicability and impact of all Accounting Standards Updates (ASUs) issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). ASUs not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are expected to have minimal impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows (consolidated financial statements). In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance on accounting for leases which requires lessees to recognize most leases on their balance sheets for the rights and obligations created by those leases. The guidance requires enhanced disclosures regarding the amount, timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases that will be effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. The standard allows modified retrospective transition method where an entity can elect to apply the transition provisions at the adoption date and recognize a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the period of adoption. Effective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted the new lease accounting standard using the modified retrospective transition option of applying the new standard at the adoption date. In addition, we elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which among other things, allowed us to carry forward the historical lease classification. Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recording of additional net lease assets and lease liabilities of approximately $0.7 billion. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact related to existing leases and as a result, a cumulative-effect adjustment was not recorded. We are currently working to complete the implementation of new processes and information technology tools to 44 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) assist in our ongoing lease data collection and analysis, and updating our accounting policies and internal controls in connection with the adoption of the new standard. In October 2016, the FASB issued an accounting standard update which requires an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, at the time the entity transfer occurs rather than when the asset is ultimately transferred to a third party, as required under current U.S. GAAP. The guidance is intended to reduce diversity in practice, particularly for transfers involving intellectual property. We adopted the accounting standard update as of January 1, 2018. The guidance requires application on a modified retrospective basis. The adoption of this guidance increases our deferred tax assets by $339 million with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings of the same amount. In August 2017, the FASB issued amendments to hedge accounting guidance. These amendments are intended to better align risk management strategies and financial reporting for hedging relationships. Under the new guidance, more hedging strategies will be eligible for hedge accounting and the application of hedge accounting is simplified. In addition, the new guidance amends presentation and disclosure requirements. The Company adopted this standard effective January 1, 2018 using a modified retrospective approach. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. In February 2018, the FASB issued guidance that allows for an entity to elect to reclassify the income tax effects on items within accumulated other comprehensive income resulting from U.S. Tax Reform to retained earnings. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018 with early adoption permitted, including interim periods within those years. Upon adoption, the Company does not expect to elect to reclassify the stranded income tax effects of U.S. Tax Reform from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings. Note 2. Acquisitions and Divestitures During 2018, we acquired businesses for an aggregate cost (net of cash and debt assumed) of approximately $535 million, mainly due to the November 2018 acquisition of Transnorm, a global leader in high-performance conveyor and warehouse solutions. Transnorm is part of Safety and Productivity Solutions. The preliminary determination of the assets and liabilities acquired with Transnorm have been included in the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2018, including $338 million allocated to goodwill, which is non-deductible for tax purposes. During 2017 there were no significant acquisitions individually or in aggregate. During 2016, we acquired businesses for an aggregate cost (net of cash and debt assumed) of $2,538 million. In August 2016, the Company acquired Intelligrated, a leading provider of supply chain and warehouse automation technologies, for an aggregate value, net of cash acquired, of $1,488 million. Intelligrated is part of Safety and Productivity Solutions. Management recorded goodwill and intangible assets acquired of, $1,121 million and $507 million, respectively. The Intelligrated identifiable intangible assets primarily include customer relationships, technology, and trade name that are being amortized over their estimated lives ranging from 1 to 15 years using straight line and accelerated amortization methods. The goodwill is non-deductible for tax purposes. In April 2016, the Company completed the acquisition of Xtralis International Holdings Limited (Xtralis), a leading global provider of aspiration smoke detection and perimeter security technologies, for an aggregate cost, net of cash acquired and debt assumed, of $515 million. Xtralis is part of Honeywell Building Technologies. In February 2016, the Company acquired 100 percent of the issued and outstanding shares of COM DEV International (COM DEV), a leading satellite and space components provider, for an aggregate value, net of cash acquired and debt assumed, of $347 million. COM DEV is part of Aerospace. 45 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) In January 2016, the Company acquired the remaining 30 percent noncontrolling interest in UOP Russell LLC, which develops technology and manufactures modular equipment to process natural gas, for $240 million. UOP Russell LLC is part of Performance Materials and Technologies. On October 1, 2018, the Company completed the tax-free spin-off to Honeywell shareowners of its Transportation Systems business, part of Aerospace, into a standalone publicly-traded company, Garrett Motion Inc. (Garrett). On October 29, 2018, the Company completed the tax-free spin-off to Honeywell shareowners of its Homes and Global Distribution business, part of Home and Building Technologies (renamed Honeywell Building Technologies following the spin-off), into a standalone publicly-traded company, Resideo Technologies, Inc. (Resideo). The assets of approximately $5.5 billion, including approximately $2.8 billion of goodwill and net of recorded indemnification receivables, and liabilities of approximately $7.2 billion associated with spin-off entities have been removed through Retained Earnings from the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the effective date of the spin-off. The results of operations and cash flows are included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows through the effective date of the spin-off. The Income before taxes attributable to the spin-off businesses were $0.4 billion, $0.5 billion, and $0.6 billion for 2018, 2017 and 2016. Honeywell shareowners of record as of the close of business on October 16, 2018 received one share of Resideo common stock for every 6 shares of Honeywell common stock. Immediately prior to the effective date of the spin-off, Resideo incurred debt of $1.2 billion to make a cash distribution to the Company. Honeywell shareowners of record as of the close of business on September 18, 2018 received one share of Garrett common stock for every 10 shares of Honeywell common stock. Immediately prior to the effective date of the spin-off, Garrett incurred debt of $1.6 billion to make a cash distribution to the Company. In 2018 in connection with the spin-off, the Company entered into certain agreements with Resideo and Garrett to effect our legal and structural separation, including transition services agreements to provide certain administrative and other services for a limited time, and tax matters and indemnity agreements. As of the end of 2018, most of those agreements are still in effect. On October 1, 2016, the Company completed the tax-free spin-off to Honeywell shareowners of its Resins and Chemicals business, part of Performance Materials and Technologies, into a standalone, publicly-traded company (named AdvanSix Inc. (AdvanSix)). The assets and liabilities associated with AdvanSix have been removed from the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet as of the effective date of the spin-off. The results of operations for AdvanSix are included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations through the effective date of the spin-off. Honeywell shareowners of record as of the close of business on September 16, 2016 received one share of AdvanSix common stock for every 25 shares of Honeywell common stock. Immediately prior to the effective date of the spin-off, AdvanSix incurred debt to make a cash distribution of $269 million to the Company. At the same time, AdvanSix also incurred $38 million of borrowings in order to fund its post spin-off working capital. In 2016 in connection with the spin-off, the Company entered into certain agreements with AdvanSix to effect our legal and structural separation including a transition services agreement with AdvanSix to provide certain administrative and other services for a limited time. As of the end of 2018, those agreements have ended. On September 16, 2016, the Company completed the sale of Honeywell Technology Solutions Inc. for a sale price of $300 million. The Company recognized a pre-tax gain of $176 million, which was recorded in Other (income) expense.

The workforce reductions were primarily related to planned site closures, mainly in Safety and Productivity Solutions, Performance Materials and Technologies and Honeywell Building Technologies, as we transition manufacturing sites to more cost-effective locations. The workforce reductions were also related to our productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives. The repositioning charge included asset impairments of $162 million mainly related to manufacturing plant and equipment associated with planned site closures. Asset impairments also included the write-down of a legacy property in Corporate in connection with its planned disposition and the write-off of certain capitalized assets in Corporate. The repositioning charge included exit costs of $79 million primarily related to a termination fee associated with the early cancellation of a supply agreement for certain raw materials in Performance Materials and Technologies and for closure obligations associated with planned site closures. In 2017, we recognized repositioning charges totaling $507 million including severance costs of $305 million related to workforce reductions of 7,096 manufacturing and administrative positions across 47 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) our segments. The workforce reductions were primarily related to cost savings actions taken in connection with our productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives and with site transitions, in each of our segments, to more cost-effective locations. The repositioning charge included asset impairments of $142 million principally in our Corporate segment related to the write-down of legacy properties and certain equipment in connection with their planned disposition and the write-down of a research and development facility in connection with a planned exit from such facility. The repositioning charge included exit costs of $60 million principally for closure obligations associated with site transitions in each of our segments and for lease exit obligations in our Corporate segment. In 2016, we recognized repositioning charges totaling $369 million including severance costs of $283 million related to workforce reductions of 6,585 manufacturing and administrative positions across our segments. The workforce reductions were primarily related to cost savings actions taken in connection with our productivity and ongoing functional transformation initiatives; the separation of the former Automation and Control Solutions reporting segment into two new reporting segments; site transitions in each of our segments to more cost-effective locations; and achieving acquisition-related synergies. The repositioning charge included asset impairments of $43 million principally related to the write-off of certain intangible assets in connection with the sale of a Performance Materials and Technologies business. The repositioning charge included exit costs of $43 million principally for expenses related to the spin-off of our AdvanSix business and closure obligations associated with site transitions. Also, $109 million of previously established accruals, primarily for severance, were returned to income as a result of higher attrition than anticipated in prior severance programs resulting in lower required severance payments, lower than expected severance costs in certain repositioning actions, and changes in scope of previously announced repositioning actions. The following table summarizes the status of our total repositioning reserves: Severance Costs Asset Impairments Exit Costs Total Balance at December 31, 2015 $ 329 $  $ 21 $ 350 2016 charges 283 43 43 369 2016 usagecash (203 )  (25 ) (228 ) 2016 usagenoncash (6 ) (43 )  (49 ) Adjustments (106 )  (3 ) (109 ) Foreign currency translation 1  (3 ) (2 ) Balance at December 31, 2016 298  33 331 2017 charges 305 142 60 507 2017 usagecash (163 )  (14 ) (177 ) 2017 usagenoncash  (142 )  (142 ) Adjustments and reclassifications (13 )  (10 ) (23 ) Foreign currency translation 15  2 17 Balance at December 31, 2017 442  71 513 2018 charges 289 162 79 530 2018 usagecash (218 )  (67 ) (285 ) 2018 usagenoncash  (163 )  (163 ) Divestitures (11 )  (3 ) (14 ) Adjustments (8 ) 1 (3 ) (10 ) Foreign currency translation (5 )   (5 ) Balance at December 31, 2018 $ 489 $  $ 77 $ 566 Certain repositioning projects will recognize exit costs in future periods when the actual liability is incurred. Such exit costs incurred in 2018, 2017 and 2016 were not significant. In 2018, the other charge of $63 million mainly relates to reserves taken due to the required wind-down of our activities in Iran and the evaluation of potential resolution of a certain legal matter. 48 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 The U.S. federal statutory income tax rate is reconciled to our effective income tax rate as follows: U.S. federal statutory income tax rate 21.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % Taxes on non-U.S. earnings (1)(2) 0.2 (12.8 ) (8.0 ) U.S. state income taxes (1) 1.6 1.4 1.1 Reserves for tax contingencies 0.3 1.6 1.2 Employee share-based payments (0.7 ) (2.9 ) (2.0 ) U.S. Tax Reform (5.8 ) 56.0  Reduction of taxes on unremitted earnings (14.2 )   Separation tax costs 5.5   All other itemsnet 0.9 (1.1 ) (2.5 ) 8.8 % 77.2 % 24.8 % (1) Net of changes in valuation allowance (2) Includes U.S. taxes on non-U.S. earnings The effective tax rate decreased by 68.4 percentage points in 2018 compared to 2017. The decrease was primarily attributable to internal restructuring initiatives that resulted in a reduction of accrued withholding taxes of approximately $1.1 billion related to unremitted foreign earnings. In addition, we recorded a tax benefit of approximately $440 million as a reduction to our 2017 provisional estimate of impacts from U.S. Tax Reform, which was partially offset by $411 million of tax costs associated with the internal restructuring of the Homes and Global Distribution business and Transportation Systems business in advance of their spin-offs. The Companys non-U.S. effective tax rate was 4.1%, a decrease of approximately 67.3 percentage points compared to 2017. The year over year decrease in the foreign effective tax rate was primarily attributable to the impact of the Companys internal restructuring initiatives and the reduction of accrued withholding taxes on unremitted foreign earnings, partially offset by the spin-off transactions. The effective tax rate increased by 52.4 percentage points in 2017 compared to 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to the provisional impact of U.S. Tax Reform, partially offset by increased tax benefits from foreign tax credits and for employee share-based payments. The Companys non-U.S. effective tax rate was 71.4%, an increase of approximately 54.7 percentage points compared to 2016. The year-over-year increase in the non-U.S. effective tax rate was primarily driven by the Companys change in assertion regarding foreign unremitted earnings, increased expense for reserves in various jurisdictions and increased withholding taxes, partially offset by higher earnings in low tax rate jurisdictions. 50 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Deferred tax assets (liabilities) The tax effects of temporary differences and tax carryforwards which give rise to future income tax benefits and payables are as follows: Deferred tax assets: December 31, 2018 2017 Postretirement benefits other than pensions 120 177 Asbestos and environmental 589 570 Employee compensation and benefits 262 218 Other accruals and reserves 336 376 Net operating and capital losses 688 632 Tax credit carryforwards 154 510 Gross deferred tax assets 2,149 2,483 Valuation allowance (689 ) (663 ) Total deferred tax assets $ 1,460 $ 1,820 Deferred tax liabilities: Pension $ (40 ) $ (40 ) Property, plant and equipment (422 ) (439 ) Intangibles (1,553 ) (1,326 ) Unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries (616 ) (2,151 ) Other asset basis differences (110 ) (210 ) Other (50 ) (67 ) Total deferred tax liabilities (2,791 ) (4,233 ) Net deferred tax liability $ (1,331 ) $ (2,413 ) Our gross deferred tax assets include $794 million related to non-U.S. operations comprised principally of net operating losses, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards (mainly in Canada, France, Germany, Luxembourg and the United Kingdom) and deductible temporary differences. We maintain a valuation allowance of $686 million against a portion of the non-U.S. gross deferred tax assets. The change in the valuation allowance resulted in increases of $57 million, $4 million and $69 million to income tax expense in 2018, 2017 and 2016. In the event we determine that we will not be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future, we will reduce such amounts through an increase to income tax expense in the period such determination is made. Conversely, if we determine that we will be able to realize net deferred tax assets in excess of the carrying amounts, we will decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a reduction to income tax expense in the period that such determination is made. As of December 31, 2018, we have recorded a $616 million deferred tax liability on all of our unremitted foreign earnings based on estimated earnings and profits of approximately $20.5 billion as of the balance sheet date. As of December 31, 2018, our net operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards were as follows: Jurisdiction Expiration Period Net Operating and Capital Loss Carryforwards Tax Credit Carryforwards U.S. Federal 2038 $ 9 $ 22 U.S. State 2038 406 18 Non-U.S. 2038 310 117 Non-U.S. Indefinite 2,353  $ 3,078 $ 157 51 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Many jurisdictions impose limitations on the timing and utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. In those instances, whereby there is an expected permanent limitation on the utilization of the net operating loss or tax credit carryforward, the deferred tax asset and amount of the carryforward have been reduced. 2018 2017 2016 Change in unrecognized tax benefits: Balance at beginning of year $ 947 $ 877 $ 765 Gross increases related to current period tax positions 370 94 96 Gross increases related to prior periods tax positions 82 153 88 Gross decreases related to prior periods tax positions (201 ) (91 ) (33 ) Decrease related to resolutions of audits with tax authorities (40 ) (76 ) (3 ) Expiration of the statute of limitations for the assessment of taxes (50 ) (54 ) (10 ) Foreign currency translation (19 ) 44 (26 ) Balance at end of year $ 1,089 $ 947 $ 877 As of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 there were $1,089 million, $947 million and $877 million of unrecognized tax benefits that if recognized would be recorded as a component of Tax expense. The following table summarizes tax years that remain subject to examination by major tax jurisdictions as of December 31, 2018: Jurisdiction Open Tax Years Based on Originally Filed Returns Examination in progress Examination not yet initiated U.S. Federal 2015  2016 2015, 2017  2018 U.S. State 2011  2017 2012  2018 Australia N/A 2016  2018 Canada (1) 2010  2016 2017  2018 China 2003  2017 2018 France 2008  2017 2018 Germany (1) 2007  2018 N/A India 1998  2016 2017  2018 Switzerland (1) 2013  2014 2017  2018 United Kingdom 2013  2017 2018 (1) Includes provincial or similar local jurisdictions, as applicable. Based on the outcome of these examinations, or as a result of the expiration of statute of limitations for specific jurisdictions, it is reasonably possible that certain unrecognized tax benefits for tax positions taken on previously filed tax returns will materially change from those recorded as liabilities in our financial statements. In addition, the outcome of these examinations may impact the valuation of certain deferred tax assets (such as net operating losses) in future periods. Unrecognized tax benefits for examinations in progress were $304 million, $487 million and $398 million, as of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. Estimated interest and penalties related to the underpayment of income taxes are classified as a component of Tax expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and totaled $45 million, $28 million and $18 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. Accrued interest and penalties were $426 million, $423 million and $395 million, as of December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016. 52 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) U.S. Tax Reform During the quarter ending December 31, 2018, the Company completed the accounting for the tax effects of U.S. Tax Reform which amounted to a total tax charge of approximately $3.5 billion, most of which was recorded as a provisional estimate at the end of 2017. During 2018, we reduced our provisional estimate by approximately $440 million as a reduction to Tax expense. Corporate Tax Rate Change The Company recorded a total tax benefit of approximately $190 million due to the decrease in the corporate statutory tax rate from 35% to 21%. This includes a measurement period adjustment of approximately $90 million recorded during 2018 as a reduction to Tax expense. The change in the provisional estimate primarily relates to information contained in tax returns that were filed during the quarter ending December 31, 2018, some of which require approval from U.S. tax authorities. The tax benefit from the change in tax rates results from the Companys deferred tax liability position for the excess of its net book value over its tax basis of its U.S. assets and liabilities that will generate future taxable income in excess of book income. This additional taxable income will be subject to tax at a lower corporate tax rate, consequently reducing the Companys deferred tax liability. Mandatory Transition Tax The Company recorded a total tax charge of approximately $1,950 million due to the imposition of the mandatory transition tax (MTT) on the deemed repatriation of undistributed foreign earnings. This includes a measurement period adjustment of approximately $50 million recorded during 2018 as an increase to Tax expense. The change in the provisional estimate primarily relates to updated amounts from tax returns that were finalized during 2018, computations based on 2018 testing dates and guidance from the taxing authorities that was received during the year. The Company has elected to pay the MTT liability over a period of eight years. Undistributed Foreign Earnings The Company recorded a total tax charge of approximately $1,700 million due to the Companys intent to no longer permanently reinvest the historical unremitted earnings of its foreign affiliates that existed as of December 31, 2017. This includes a measurement period adjustment of approximately $400 million recorded during 2018 as a reduction to Tax expense. The change in the provisional estimate primarily relates to updated amounts from tax returns that were finalized during 2018, the application of foreign tax credits based on guidance issued during the year and changes to the applicable withholding tax rates in local jurisdictions. During 2018, the Company executed various internal restructuring initiatives that reduced the taxes on unremitted foreign earnings by approximately $1.1 billion that was recorded as a reduction to Tax expense. Global Intangible Low Taxed Income U.S. Tax Reform imposes a U.S. tax on global intangible low taxed income (GILTI) that is earned by certain foreign affiliates owned by a U.S. shareholder. GILTI is generally intended to impose tax on the earnings of a foreign corporation that are deemed to exceed a certain threshold return relative to the underlying business investment. The Company has made a policy election to treat future taxes related to GILTI as a current period expense in the reporting period in which the tax is incurred. Note 6. Earnings Per Share The details of the earnings per share calculations for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 are as follows: Basic Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Net income attributable to Honeywell $ 6,765 $ 1,545 $ 4,812 Weighted average shares outstanding 743.0 762.1 764.3 Earnings per share of common stock $ 9.10 $ 2.03 $ 6.30 53 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

In 2018, 2017, and 2016 the weighted number of stock options excluded from the computations were 2.5 million, 2.8 million, and 7.5 million. These stock options were outstanding at the end of each of the respective periods. Note 7. Revenue Recognition and Contracts with Customers Adoption On January 1, 2018, the Company adopted new guidance on revenue from contracts with customers using the modified retrospective method applied to contracts that were not completed as of January 1, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 are presented under the new guidance, while prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with previous guidance. We recorded a net decrease to opening retained earnings of $75 million as of January 1, 2018, for the cumulative impact of adopting the new guidance. The impact primarily related to the change in accounting for mechanical service programs (change from input to output method, resulting in unbilled receivables (within Accounts receivablenet) and deferred revenue (within Accrued liabilities) being eliminated through Retained earnings) and for customer funding and the related costs incurred for nonrecurring engineering and development activities (deferral of revenues and related incurred costs until products are delivered to customers, resulting in increases in both deferred costs (assets) and deferred revenue (liability) by approximately $1.1 billion at adoption). Balance at December 31, 2017 New Revenue Standard Adjustment Balance at January 1, 2018 ASSETS Current assets: Accounts receivablenet $ 8,866 $ (149 ) $ 8,717 Inventories 4,613 (10 ) 4,603 Deferred income taxes 251 40 291 Other assets 3,372 1,082 4,454 LIABILITIES Current liabilities: Accrued liabilities 6,968 (48 ) 6,920 Deferred income taxes 2,664 1 2,665 Other liabilities 5,930 1,084 7,014 SHAREOWNERS EQUITY Retained earnings 27,481 (75 ) 27,406 Noncontrolling interest $ 163 $ 1 $ 164 54 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Under the modified retrospective method of adoption, we are required to disclose the impact to revenues had we continued to follow our accounting policies under the previous revenue recognition guidance. We estimate that the impact to revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018 would have been a decrease of approximately $339 million, which is primarily due to the net impact of the classification change and deferral impact of nonrecurring engineering and development activities, and the net impact from service programs with certain amounts being recognized that would have previously been deferred, and certain amount being deferred that would have previously been recognized.

For a summary by disaggregated product and services sales for each segment, refer to Note 22 Segment Financial Data. We recognize revenue arising from performance obligations outlined in contracts with our customers that are satisfied at a point in time and over time. The disaggregation of our revenue based off timing of recognition is as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2018 Products, transferred point in time 67 % Products, transferred over time 12 Net product sales 79 Services, transferred point in time 7 Services, transferred over time 14 Net service sales 21 Net sales 100 % 56 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Contract Balances Progress on satisfying performance obligations under contracts with customers and the related billings and cash collections are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in Accounts receivablenet and Other assets (the current and noncurrent portions, respectively, of unbilled receivables (contract assets) and billed receivables) and Accrued liabilities and Other liabilities (the current and noncurrent portions, respectively, of customer advances and deposits (contract liabilities)). Unbilled receivables (contract assets) arise when the timing of cash collected from customers differs from the timing of revenue recognition, such as when contract provisions require specific milestones to be met before a customer can be billed. Those assets are recognized when the revenue associated with the contract is recognized prior to billing and derecognized when billed in accordance with the terms of the contract. Contract liabilities are recorded when customers remit contractual cash payments in advance of us satisfying performance obligations under contractual arrangements, including those with performance obligations to be satisfied over a period of time. Contract liabilities are derecognized when revenue is recorded, either when a milestone is met triggering the contractual right to bill or when the performance obligation is satisfied. Contract balances are classified as assets or liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. The following table summarizes our contract assets and liabilities balances: 2018 Contract assetsJanuary 1 $ 1,721 Contract assetsDecember 31 1,548 Change in contract assetsincrease (decrease) $ (173 ) Contract liabilitiesJanuary 1 $ (2,973 ) Contract liabilitiesDecember 31 (3,378 ) Change in contract liabilities(increase) decrease $ (405 ) Net change $ (578 ) The net change was primarily driven by the receipt of advance payments from customers exceeding reductions from recognition of revenue as performance obligations were satisfied and related billings. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized revenue of $1,166 million that was previously included in the beginning balance of contract liabilities. When contracts are modified to account for changes in contract specifications and requirements, we consider whether the modification either creates new or changes the existing enforceable rights and obligations. Contract modifications that are for goods or services that are not distinct from the existing contract, due to the significant integration with the original good or service provided, are accounted for as if they were part of that existing contract. The effect of a contract modification on the transaction price and our measure of progress for the performance obligation to which it relates, is recognized as an adjustment to revenue (either as an increase in or a reduction of revenue) on a cumulative catch-up basis. When the modifications include additional performance obligations that are distinct and at relative stand-alone selling price, they are accounted for as a new contract and performance obligation, which are recognized prospectively. Performance Obligations A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is defined as the unit of account. A contracts transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. When our contracts with customers require highly complex integration or manufacturing 57 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) services that are not separately identifiable from other promises in the contracts and, therefore, not distinct, then the entire contract is accounted for as a single performance obligation. In situations when our contract includes distinct goods or services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer over time, they are recognized as a series of distinct goods or services. For any contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contracts transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated relative standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. For product sales, each product sold to a customer typically represents a distinct performance obligation. In such cases, the observable standalone sales are used to determine the stand alone selling price. Performance obligations are satisfied as of a point in time or over time. Performance obligations are supported by contracts with customers, providing a framework for the nature of the distinct goods, services or bundle of goods and services. The timing of satisfying the performance obligation is typically indicated by the terms of the contract. The following table outlines our performance obligations disaggregated by segment. 2018 Aerospace $ 10,228 Honeywell Building Technologies 6,302 Performance Materials and Technologies 6,436 Safety and Productivity Solutions 1,884 $ 24,850 Performance obligations recognized as of December 31, 2018 will be satisfied over the course of future periods. Our disclosure of the timing for satisfying the performance obligation is based on the requirements of contracts with customers. However, from time to time, these contracts may be subject to modifications, impacting the timing of satisfying the performance obligations. Performance obligations expected to be satisfied within one year and greater than one year are 56% and 44%. The timing of satisfaction of our performance obligations does not significantly vary from the typical timing of payment. Typical payment terms of our fixed-price over time contracts include progress payments based on specified events or milestones, or based on project progress. For some contracts we may be entitled to receive an advance payment. We have applied the practical expedient for certain revenue streams to exclude the value of remaining performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected term of one year or less or (ii) contracts for which we recognize revenue in proportion to the amount we have the right to invoice for services performed.

On April 27, 2018, the Company entered into a $4 billion Amended and Restated Five Year Credit Agreement (the 5-Year Credit Agreement), with a syndicate of banks. The 5-Year Credit Agreement is maintained for general corporate purposes. Commitments under the 5-Year Credit Agreement can be increased pursuant to the terms of the 5-Year Credit Agreement to an aggregate amount not to exceed $4.5 billion. The 5-Year Credit Agreement amends and restates the previously reported $4 billion five year credit agreement dated as of July 10, 2015 (the Prior Agreement). The 5-Year Credit Agreement has substantially the same material terms and conditions as the Prior Agreement. On April 27, 2018, the Company entered into an additional $1.5 billion 364-Day Credit Agreement with a syndicate of banks. This 364-Day Credit Agreement is maintained for general corporate purposes.

Note 15. Financial Instruments and Fair Value Measures Credit and Market Risk Financial instruments, including derivatives, expose us to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and to market risk related to changes in interest and currency exchange rates. We manage our exposure to counterparty credit risk through specific minimum credit standards, diversification of counterparties, and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk. Our counterparties in derivative transactions are substantial investment and commercial banks with significant experience using such derivative instruments. We monitor the impact of market risk on the fair value and cash flows of our derivative and other financial instruments considering reasonably possible changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates and restrict the use of derivative financial instruments to hedging activities. We continually monitor the creditworthiness of our customers to which we grant credit terms in the normal course of business. The terms and conditions of our credit sales are designed to mitigate or eliminate concentrations of credit risk with any single customer. Our sales are not materially dependent on a single customer or a small group of customers. Foreign Currency Risk Management We conduct our business on a multinational basis in a wide variety of foreign currencies. Our exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates arises from international financing activities between subsidiaries, foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and transactions arising from international trade. Our primary objective is to preserve the U.S. Dollar value of foreign currency denominated cash flows and earnings. We attempt to hedge currency exposures with natural offsets to the fullest extent possible and, once these opportunities have been exhausted, through foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts (foreign currency exchange contracts) with third parties. We hedge monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies. Prior to conversion into U.S. dollars, these assets and liabilities are remeasured at spot exchange rates in effect on the balance sheet date. The effects of changes in spot rates are recognized in earnings and included in other (income) expense. We partially hedge forecasted sales and purchases, which are denominated in non-functional currencies, with foreign currency exchange contracts. Changes in the forecasted non-functional currency cash flows due to movements in exchange rates are substantially offset by changes in the fair value of the foreign currency exchange contracts designated as hedges. Market value gains and losses on these contracts are recognized in earnings when the hedged transaction is recognized. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had contracts with notional amounts of $14,995 million and $9,273 million to exchange foreign currencies, principally the U.S. Dollar, Euro, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Mexican Peso, Swiss Franc, Indian Rupee, Russian Ruble, and Chinese Renminbi. As of December 31, 2018, we estimate that approximately $90 million of net 63 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) derivative gains related to our cash flow hedges included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) will be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months. We have also designated foreign currency debt and certain derivative contracts as hedges against portions of our net investment in foreign operations during the year ended December 31, 2018. Gains or losses on the effective portion of the foreign currency debt designated as a net investment hedge are recorded in the same manner as foreign currency translation adjustments. The Company did not have ineffectiveness related to net investment hedges during the year ended December 31, 2018. Interest Rate Risk Management We use a combination of financial instruments, including long-term, medium-term and short-term financing, variable-rate commercial paper, and interest rate swaps to manage the interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges effectively changed $2,600 million of fixed rate debt at 2.93% to LIBOR based floating rate debt. Our interest rate swaps mature at various dates through 2026. Fair Value of Financial Instruments The FASBs accounting guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date (exit price). Financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The following table sets forth the Companys financial assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2018 and 2017: December 31, 2018 2017 Assets: Foreign currency exchange contracts $ 119 $ 17 Available for sale investments 1,784 3,916 Interest rate swap agreements 20 44 Cross currency swap agreements 32  Liabilities: Foreign currency exchange contracts $ 4 $ 70 Interest rate swap agreements 65 52 The foreign currency exchange contracts, interest rate swap agreements, and cross currency swap agreements are valued using broker quotations, or market transactions in either the listed or over-the-counter markets. As such, these derivative instruments are classified within level 2. The Company also holds investments in commercial paper, certificates of deposits, and time deposits that are designated as available for sale and are valued using published prices based off observable market data. As such, these investments are classified within level 2. The Company also holds available for sale investments in U.S. government and corporate debt securities valued utilizing published prices based on quoted market pricing, which are classified within level 1. The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents, trade accounts and notes receivables, payables, commercial paper and short-term borrowings contained in the Consolidated Balance Sheet approximates fair value. The following table sets forth the Companys financial assets and liabilities that were not carried at fair value: December 31, 2018 December 31, 2017 Carrying Value Fair Value Carrying Value Fair Value Assets Long-term receivables $ 333 $ 329 $ 296 $ 289 Liabilities Long-term debt and related current maturities $ 12,628 $ 13,133 $ 13,924 $ 14,695 64 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

As such, the fair value of these receivables is considered level 2. The Company determined the fair value of the long-term debt and related current maturities utilizing transactions in the listed markets for identical or similar liabilities. As such, the fair value of the long-term debt and related current maturities is considered level 2. Interest rate swap agreements are designated as hedge relationships with gains or losses on the derivative recognized in interest and other financial charges offsetting the gains and losses on the underlying debt being hedged. Losses on interest rate swap agreements recognized in earnings were $37 million, $29 million and $71 million in the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016. Gains and losses are fully offset by losses and gains on the underlying debt being hedged. We economically hedge our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates principally with forward contracts. These contracts are marked-to-market with the resulting gains and losses recognized in earnings offsetting the gains and losses on the non-functional currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities being hedged. We recognized $394 million of income and $207 million of expense in Other (income) expense in the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. We recognized $232 million of income in Other (income) expense in the year ended December 31, 2016.

The exercise price of stock options is set on the grant date and may not be less than the fair market value per share of our stock on that date. The fair value is recognized as an expense over the employees requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the award). Options generally vest over a four-year period and expire after ten years. The fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. Expected volatility is based on implied volatilities from traded options on our common stock and historical volatility of our common stock. We used a Monte Carlo simulation model to derive an expected term which represents an estimate of the time options are expected to remain outstanding. Such model uses historical data to estimate option exercise activity and post-vest termination behavior. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.

Commitments and Contingencies Environmental Matters We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign government requirements relating to the protection of the environment. We believe that, as a general matter, our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of environmental damage and personal injury and that our handling, manufacture, use and disposal of hazardous substances are in accordance with environmental and safety laws and regulations. However, mainly because of past operations and operations of predecessor companies, we, like other companies engaged in similar businesses, have incurred remedial response and voluntary cleanup costs for site contamination and are a party to lawsuits and claims associated with environmental and safety matters, including past production of products containing hazardous substances. Additional lawsuits, claims and costs involving environmental matters are likely to continue to arise in the future. With respect to environmental matters involving site contamination, we continually conduct studies, individually or jointly with other potentially responsible parties, to determine the feasibility of various remedial techniques. It is our policy to record appropriate liabilities for environmental matters 72 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) when remedial efforts or damage claim payments are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. Such liabilities are based on our best estimate of the undiscounted future costs required to complete the remedial work. The recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical, regulatory or legal information becomes available. Given the uncertainties regarding the status of laws, regulations, enforcement policies, the impact of other potentially responsible parties, technology and information related to individual sites, we do not believe it is possible to develop an estimate of the range of reasonably possible environmental loss in excess of our recorded liabilities. We expect to fund expenditures for these matters from operating cash flow. The timing of cash expenditures depends on a number of factors, including the timing of remedial investigations and feasibility studies, the timing of litigation and settlements of remediation liability, personal injury and property damage claims, regulatory approval of cleanup projects, remedial techniques to be utilized and agreements with other parties. The following table summarizes information concerning our recorded liabilities for environmental costs: Years Ended December 31, 2018 2017 2016 Beginning of year $ 595 $ 511 $ 518 Accruals for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable 395 287 195 Environmental liability payments (218 ) (212 ) (228 ) Other (17 ) 9 26 End of year $ 755 $ 595 $ 511 Environmental liabilities are included in the following balance sheet accounts: December 31, 2018 2017 Accrued liabilities $ 175 $ 226 Other liabilities 580 369 $ 755 $ 595 We do not currently possess sufficient information to reasonably estimate the amounts of environmental liabilities to be recorded upon future completion of studies, litigation or settlements, and neither the timing nor the amount of the ultimate costs associated with environmental matters can be determined although they could be material to our consolidated results of operations and operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid. However, considering our past experience and existing reserves, we do not expect that environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. In conjunction with the Resideo spin-off, the Company entered into an indemnification and reimbursement agreement with a Resideo subsidiary, pursuant to which Resideos subsidiary has an ongoing obligation to make cash payments to Honeywell in amounts equal to 90 percent of Honeywells annual net spending for environmental matters at certain sites as defined in the agreement. The amount payable to Honeywell in any given year is subject to a cap of $140 million, and the obligation will continue until the earlier of December 31, 2043, or December 31 of the third consecutive year during which the annual payment obligation has been less than $25 million. Reimbursements associated with this indemnification agreement were $25 million in 2018 and offset operating cash outflows incurred by the Company. As the Company records the accruals for environmental matters deemed probable and reasonably estimable related to the sites covered by the indemnification agreement, a corresponding receivable from Resideo for 90 percent of that accrual is also recorded. This receivable amount recorded in 2018 subsequent to the spin-off was $50 million. As 73 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) of December 31, 2018, Other Current Assets and Other Assets includes $140 million and $476 million representing the short-term and long-term portion of the receivable amount due from Resideo under the indemnification and reimbursement agreement. Asbestos Matters Honeywell is a defendant in asbestos related personal injury actions related to North American Refractories Company (NARCO), which was sold in 1986, and Bendix Friction Materials (Bendix) business, which was sold in 2014. In the third quarter of 2018, the Company revised its accounting to correct the time period associated with the determination of appropriate accruals for the legacy Bendix asbestos-related liability for unasserted claims. The prior accounting treatment applied a five-year time horizon; the revised treatment reflects the full term of epidemiological projections through 2059. Previously issued financial statements have been revised for this correction with the following effects: The Companys revised estimated asbestos-related liabilities are now $2,610 million as of December 31, 2017, which is $1,087 million higher than the Companys prior estimate. The Companys insurance recoveries for asbestos-related liabilities are estimated to be $503 million as of December 31, 2017, which is $68 million higher than the Companys prior estimate. As of December 31, 2017, the net deferred income taxes impact was $245 million, with a decrease to liabilities and increase to assets, and the cumulative impact on retained earnings was a decrease of $774 million. For 2017 and 2016 Cost of services sold decreased $48 million and $5 million, Tax expense increased $158 million and $2 million, and Net income decreased $110 million and $3 million. This revision followed the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Division of Corporation Finance review of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for 2017, which included review of our prior accounting for liability for unasserted Bendix-related asbestos claims. On September 13, 2018, following completion of Corporation Finances review, the SEC Division of Enforcement advised that it has opened an investigation related to this matter. Honeywell intends to provide requested information and otherwise fully cooperate with the SEC staff. On October 31, 2018, David Kanefsky, a Honeywell shareholder, filed a putative class action complaint alleging violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 related to the prior accounting for Bendix asbestos claims. We believe the Complaint has no merit.

When the NARCO business was sold, Honeywells predecessor entered into a cross-indemnity agreement with NARCO which included an obligation to indemnify the purchaser for asbestos claims. Such claims arise primarily from alleged occupational exposure to asbestos-containing refractory brick and mortar for high-temperature applications. NARCO ceased manufacturing these products in 1980, and the first asbestos claims were filed in the tort system against NARCO in 1983. Claims filings and related costs increased dramatically in the late 1990s through 2001, which led to NARCO filing for bankruptcy in January 2002. Once NARCO filed for bankruptcy, all then current and future NARCO asbestos claims were stayed against both NARCO and Honeywell pending the reorganization of NARCO. Following the bankruptcy filing, in December 2002 Honeywell recorded a total NARCO asbestos liability of $3.2 billion, which was comprised of three components: (i) the estimated liability to settle pre-bankruptcy petition NARCO claims and certain post-petition settlements ($2.2 billion, referred to as Pre-bankruptcy NARCO Liability), (ii) the estimated liability related to then unasserted NARCO claims for the period 2004 through 2018 ($950 million, referred to as NARCO Trust Liability), and (iii) other NARCO bankruptcy-related obligations totaling $73 million. When the NARCO Trust Liability of $950 million was established in 2002, the methodology for estimating the potential liability was based primarily on: (a) epidemiological projections of the future incidence of disease for the period 2004 through 2018, a fifteen-year period; (b) historical claims rates in the tort system for the five-year period prior to the bankruptcy filing date; and (c) anticipated NARCO Trust payment values set forth in the then current draft of the NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures. The methodology required estimating, by disease, three critical inputs: (i) likely number of claims to be asserted against the NARCO Trust in the future, (ii) percentage of those claims likely to receive payment, and (iii) payment values. The Company utilized outside asbestos liability valuation specialists 75 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) to support our preparation of the NARCO Trust Liability estimate, which was based on a commonly accepted methodology used by numerous bankruptcy courts addressing 524(g) trusts. In 2002, when we first established our initial liability, NARCO asbestos claims resolution shifted from the tort system to an anticipated NARCO Trust framework, where claims would be processed in accordance with established NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures, including strict medical and exposure criteria for a plaintiff to receive compensation. We believed at the time that the NARCO Trusts claims filing and resolution experience after the NARCO Trust became operational would be significantly different from pre-bankruptcy tort system experience in light of these more rigorous claims processing requirements in the NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures and Honeywells active oversight of claims processing and approval. Given these anticipated differences, we believed that a 15-year time period was the appropriate horizon for establishing a probable and reasonably estimable liability for then unasserted NARCO claims as it represented our best estimate of the time period it would take for the NARCO Trust to be approved by the Bankruptcy Court, become fully operational and generate sufficiently reliable claims data (i.e., a data set which is statistically representative) to enable us to update our NARCO Trust Liability. The NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures were finalized in 2006, and the Company updated its NARCO Trust Liability to reflect the final terms and payment values. The original 15-year period (from 2004 through 2018) for unasserted claims did not change as asbestos claims filings continued to be stayed against both Honeywell and NARCO. The 2006 update resulted in a range of the estimated liability for unasserted claims of $743 million to $961 million, and we believed that no amount within this range was a better estimate than any other amount. In accordance with ASC 450Contingencies (ASC 450), we recorded the low end of the range of $743 million which resulted in a reduction of $207 million in our NARCO Trust Liability. NARCO emerged from bankruptcy on April 30, 2013, at which time a federally authorized 524(g) trust was established for the evaluation and resolution of all existing and future NARCO asbestos claims. Both Honeywell and NARCO are protected by a permanent channeling injunction barring all present and future individual actions in state or federal courts and requiring all asbestos related claims based on exposure to NARCO asbestos-containing products to be made against the NARCO Trust. The NARCO Trust Agreement and the NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures are the principal documents setting forth the structure of the NARCO Trust. These documents establish Honeywells evergreen funding obligations. Honeywell is obligated to fund NARCO asbestos claims submitted to the NARCO Trust which qualify for payment under the Trust Distribution Procedures (Annual Contribution Claims), subject to an annual cap of $145 million. However, the initial $100 million of claims processed through the NARCO Trust (the Initial Claims Amount) will not count against the annual cap and any unused portion of the Initial Claims Amount will roll over to subsequent years until fully utilized. These documents also establish the material operating rules for the NARCO Trust, including Honeywell audit rights and the criteria claimants must meet to have a valid claim paid. These claims payment criteria include providing the NARCO Trust with adequate medical evidence of the claimants asbestos-related condition and credible evidence of exposure to a specific NARCO asbestos-containing product. Further, the NARCO Trust is eligible to receive cash dividends from Harbison-Walker International Inc (HWI), the reorganized and renamed entity that emerged, fully operational, from the NARCO bankruptcy. The NARCO Trust is required to use any funding received from HWI to pay Annual Contribution Claims until those funds are exhausted. It is only at this point that Honeywells funding obligation to the Trust is triggered. Thus, there is an unrelated primary source for funding that affects Honeywells funding of the NARCO Trust Liability. Once operational, the NARCO Trust began to receive, process and pay claims that had been previously stayed pending the Trust becoming operational. As the NARCO Trust began to pay claims in 2014, we began to assert our on-going audit rights to review and monitor the claims processors adherence to the established requirements of the NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures. While doing 76 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) so, we identified several issues with the way the Trust was implementing the NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures. In 2015, Honeywell filed suit against the NARCO Trust in Bankruptcy Court alleging breach of certain provisions of the NARCO Trust Agreement and NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures. The parties agreed to dismiss the proceeding without prejudice pursuant to an 18-month Standstill Agreement, which expired in October 2017. Notwithstanding its expiration, claims processing continues, and Honeywell continues to negotiate and attempt to resolve remaining disputed issues (that is, instances where Honeywell believes the NARCO Trust is not processing claims in accordance with established NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures). Honeywell reserves the right to seek judicial intervention should negotiations fail. After the NARCO Trust became effective in 2013, the $743 million NARCO Trust Liability was then comprised of: (i) liability for unasserted claims; and (ii) liability for claims asserted after the NARCO Trust became operational but not yet paid. Although we know the number of claims filed with the NARCO Trust each year, we are not able to determine at this time the portion of the NARCO Trust Liability which represents asserted versus unasserted claims due to the lack of sufficiently reliable claims data because of the claims processing issues described previously. Honeywell maintained the $743 million accrual for NARCO Trust Liability, as there has not been sufficiently reliable claims data history to enable us to update that liability. As of December 31, 2018, our total NARCO asbestos liability of $891 million reflects Pre-bankruptcy NARCO liability of $148 million and NARCO Trust Liability of $743 million. Through December 31, 2018, Pre-bankruptcy NARCO Liability has been reduced by approximately $2 billion since first established in 2002, largely related to settlement payments. The remaining Pre-bankruptcy NARCO liability principally represents estimated amounts owed pursuant to settlement agreements reached during the pendency of the NARCO bankruptcy proceedings that provide for the right to submit claims to the NARCO Trust subject to qualification under the terms of the settlement agreements and Trust Distribution Procedures. The other NARCO bankruptcy obligations were paid in 2013 and no further liability is recorded. As of December 31, 2018, Honeywell has not made any payments to the NARCO Trust for Annual Contribution Claims as Annual Contribution Claims which have been paid since the Trust became operational have been funded by cash dividends from HWI. Honeywell continues to evaluate the appropriateness of the $743 million NARCO Trust Liability. Despite becoming effective in 2013, the NARCO Trust has experienced delays in becoming fully operational. Violations of the Trust Distribution Procedures and the resulting disputes and challenges, a standstill pending dispute resolution, and limited claims payments, have all contributed to the lack of sufficient normalized data based on actual claims processing experience in the Trust since it became operational. As a result, we have not been able to further update the NARCO Trust Liability. The $743 million NARCO Trust Liability continues to be appropriate because of the unresolved pending claims in the Trust, some portion of which will result in payouts in the future, and because new claims continue to be filed with the NARCO Trust. When sufficiently reliable claims data exists, we will update our estimate of the NARCO Trust Liability and it is possible that a material change may need to be recognized. Our insurance receivable of $307 million as of December 31, 2018, corresponding to the estimated liability for asserted and unasserted NARCO asbestos claims, reflects coverage which reimburses Honeywell for portions of NARCO-related indemnity and defense costs and is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market. We conduct analyses to estimate the probable amount of insurance that is recoverable for asbestos claims. While the substantial majority of our 77 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. We made judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers. Bendix Products Bendix manufactured automotive brake linings that contained chrysotile asbestos in an encapsulated form. Claimants consist largely of individuals who allege exposure to asbestos from brakes from either performing or being in the vicinity of individuals who performed brake replacements.

Our consolidated financial statements reflect an estimated liability for resolution of asserted (claims filed as of the financial statement date) and unasserted Bendix-related asbestos claims and excludes the Companys legal fees to defend such asbestos claims which will continue to be expensed by the Company as they are incurred. We have valued Bendix asserted and unasserted claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. We update the resolution values used to estimate the cost of Bendix asserted and unasserted claims during the fourth quarter each year. Honeywell reflects the inclusion of all years of epidemiological disease projection through 2059 when estimating the liability for unasserted Bendix-related asbestos claims. Such liability for unasserted Bendix-related asbestos claims is based on historic and anticipated claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. Our insurance receivable corresponding to the liability for settlement of asserted and unasserted Bendix asbestos claims reflects coverage which is provided by a large number of insurance policies written by dozens of insurance companies in both the domestic insurance market and the London excess market. Based on our ongoing analysis of the probable insurance recovery, insurance receivables are recorded in the financial statements simultaneous with the recording of the estimated liability for the underlying asbestos claims. This determination is based on our analysis of the underlying insurance policies, our historical experience with our insurers, our ongoing review of the 78 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) solvency of our insurers, judicial determinations relevant to our insurance programs, and our consideration of the impacts of any settlements reached with our insurers. In conjunction with the Garrett spin-off, the Company entered into an indemnification and reimbursement agreement with a Garrett subsidiary, pursuant to which Garretts subsidiary will have an obligation to make cash payments to Honeywell in amounts equal to (i) 90% of Honeywells asbestos-related liability payments primarily related to the Bendix business in the United States, as well as certain environmental-related liability payments and accounts payable and non-United States asbestos-related liability payments, in each case related to legacy elements of the Garrett business, including the legal costs of defending and resolving such liabilities, less (ii) 90% of Honeywells net insurance receipts and, as may be applicable, certain other recoveries associated with such liabilities. The amount payable to Honeywell in respect of such liabilities arising in any given year will be subject to a cap of approximately Euro 150 million (equivalent to $175 million at the time the indemnification agreement was entered into). The obligation will continue until the earlier of December 31, 2048, or December 31 of the third consecutive year during which the annual indemnification obligation has been less than the Euro equivalent, at the fixed exchange rate at time of the indemnification agreement, of $25 million. Reimbursements associated with this indemnification agreement were $42 million in 2018. As the Company records the accruals for matters covered by the indemnification agreement, a corresponding receivable from Garrett is recorded for 90 percent of that accrual as determined by the terms of the agreement. In 2018 subsequent to the spin-off, the Company recorded a reversal to the receivable for $17 million in the fourth quarter of 2018. As of December 31, 2018, Other Current Assets and Other Assets includes $171 million and $1,058 million representing the short-term and long-term portion of the receivable amount due from Garrett under the indemnification and reimbursement agreement. Other Matters We are subject to a number of other lawsuits, investigations and disputes (some of which involve substantial amounts claimed) arising out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to commercial transactions, government contracts, product liability, prior acquisitions and divestitures, employee benefit plans, intellectual property, and environmental, health and safety matters. We recognize a liability for any contingency that is probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. We continually assess the likelihood of adverse judgments of outcomes in these matters, as well as potential ranges of possible losses (taking into consideration any insurance recoveries), based on a careful analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Included in these other matters are the following: Honeywell v. United Auto Workers (UAW) et. al In September 2011, the UAW and certain Honeywell retirees (Plaintiffs) filed a suit in the Eastern District of Michigan (the District Court) alleging that a series of Master Collective Bargaining Agreements (MCBAs) between Honeywell and the UAW provided the retirees with rights to lifetime, vested healthcare benefits that could never be changed or reduced. Plaintiffs alleged that Honeywell had violated those vested rights by implementing express limitations (CAPS) on the amount Honeywell contributed toward healthcare coverage for the retirees. Honeywell subsequently answered the UAWs complaint and asserted counterclaims, including for breach of implied warranty. Between 2014 and 2015, Honeywell began enforcing the CAPS against former employees. In response, the UAW and certain of the Plaintiffs filed a motion seeking a ruling that the MCBAs do not limit Honeywells obligation to contribute to healthcare coverage for those retirees. On March 29, 2018, the District Court issued its opinion resolving all pending summary judgment motions, except for Honeywells counterclaim for breach of implied warranty, which has since been dismissed without prejudice. 79 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) In the opinion, the District Court held that the MCBAs do not promise retirees vested, lifetime benefits that survive expiration of the MCBAs. Based on this ruling, Honeywell terminated the retirees healthcare coverage benefits altogether as of July 31, 2018. In response, the UAW filed a motion to enjoin Honeywell from completely terminating coverage as of July 31, 2018, arguing that the CAPS themselves are vested and that Honeywell must continue to provide retiree medical benefits at the capped level. On July 28, 2018, the District Court denied the UAWs motion and entered a final judgment consistent with its March 2018 ruling. The UAW has appealed this decision to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals. Honeywell believes the District Courts ruling will be upheld. In the March 2018 opinion, the District Court also held that Honeywell is obligated under the MCBAs to pay the full premium for retiree healthcare rather than the capped amount. Based on this ruling, Honeywell would be required to pay monetary damages to retirees for any past years in which Honeywell paid less than the full premium of their healthcare coverage. Such damages would be limited, depending on the retiree group, to a two to three-year period ending when the 2016 MCBA expired, and Honeywell would have no ongoing obligation to continue funding healthcare coverage for subsequent periods. Honeywell has appealed the District Courts ruling on this full premium damages issue, and believes that the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals will reverse the District Court on that issue. In the event the Sixth Circuit were to sustain the District Courts ruling on this issue, Honeywell would be liable for damages of at least $12 million. Given the uncertainty inherent in litigation and investigations (including the specific matter referenced above), we do not believe it is possible to develop estimates of reasonably possible loss in excess of current accruals for these matters (other than as specifically set forth above). Considering our past experience and existing accruals, we do not expect the outcome of these matters, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position. Because most contingencies are resolved over long periods of time, potential liabilities are subject to change due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, which could cause us to pay damage awards or settlements (or become subject to equitable remedies) that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or operating cash flows in the periods recognized or paid. Warranties and Guarantees In the normal course of business we issue product warranties and product performance guarantees. We accrue for the estimated cost of product warranties and performance guarantees based on contract terms and historical experience at the time of sale. Adjustments to initial obligations for warranties and guarantees are made as changes to the obligations become reasonably estimable. The following table summarizes information concerning our recorded obligations for product warranties and product performance guarantees.

Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits We sponsor a number of both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans. Pension benefits for many of our U.S. employees are provided through non-contributory, qualified and non-qualified defined benefit plans. All non-union hourly and salaried employees joining Honeywell for the first time after December 31, 2012, are not eligible to participate in Honeywells U.S. defined benefit pension plans. We also sponsor defined benefit pension plans which cover non-U.S. employees who are not U.S. citizens, in certain jurisdictions, principally the UK, Netherlands, Germany, and Canada. Other pension plans outside of the U.S. are not material to the Company either individually or in the aggregate. We also sponsor postretirement benefit plans that provide health care benefits and life insurance coverage mainly to U.S. eligible retirees. None of Honeywells U.S. employees are eligible for a retiree medical subsidy from the Company. In addition, the vast majority of Honeywells U.S. retirees either have no Company subsidy or have a fixed-dollar subsidy amount. This significantly limits our exposure to the impact of future health care cost increases. The retiree medical and life insurance plans are not funded. Claims and expenses are paid from our operating cash flow. 81 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

Major actuarial assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations and net periodic benefit (income) cost for our significant benefit plans are presented in the following table as weighted averages. Pension Benefits U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 2016 Actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations as of December 31: Discount rate 4.35 % 3.68 % 4.20 % 2.63 % 2.36 % 2.51 % Expected annual rate of compensation increase 3.25 % 4.50 % 4.50 % 2.46 % 0.73 % 2.17 % Actuarial assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit (income) cost for years ended December 31: Discount ratebenefit obligation 3.68 % 4.20 % 4.46 % 2.36 % 2.51 % 3.49 % Discount rateservice cost 3.77 % 4.42 % 4.69 % 2.20 % 2.14 % 2.92 % Discount rateinterest cost 3.27 % 3.49 % 3.59 % 2.08 % 2.19 % 3.07 % Expected rate of return on plan assets 7.75 % 7.75 % 7.75 % 6.23 % 6.43 % 6.65 % Expected annual rate of compensation increase 4.50 % 4.50 % 4.48 % 2.49 % 2.17 % 2.11 % Other Postretirement Benefits 2018 2017 2016 Actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations as of December 31: Discount rate 4.07 % 3.39 % 3.65 % Actuarial assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for years ended December 31: Discount rate (1) 3.39 % 3.60 % 3.80 % (1) Discount rate was 3.65% for 1/1/17 through 2/28/17. Rate was changed to 3.60% for the remainder of 2017 due to Plan remeasurement as of 3/1/17. The discount rate for our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefits plans reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be settled at the measurement date of December 31. To determine discount rates for our U.S. pension and other postretirement benefit plans, we use a modeling process that involves matching the expected cash outflows of our benefit plans to a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments. We use the single weighted-average yield of this hypothetical portfolio as a discount rate benchmark. We utilize a full yield curve approach in the estimation of the service and interest cost components of net periodic pension benefit (income) for our significant pension plans. This approach applies the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the pension benefit obligation to their underlying projected cash flows and provides a more precise measurement of service and interest costs by improving the correlation between projected cash flows and their corresponding spot rates. For our U.S. pension plans, the single weighted average spot rates used to determine service and interest costs for 2019 are 4.47% and 3.94%. The discount rate used to determine the other postretirement benefit obligation is lower principally due to a shorter expected duration of other postretirement plan obligations as compared to pension plan obligations. 85 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS(Continued) (Dollars in millions, except per share amounts) Our expected rate of return on U.S. plan assets of 6.75% at December 31, 2018 was down from 7.75% at December 31, 2017 reflecting a re-balancing of assets to more fixed income during 2018. Our asset return assumption is based on historical plan asset returns over varying long-term periods combined with current market conditions and broad asset mix considerations with a focus on long-term trends rather than short-term market conditions. We review the expected rate of return on an annual basis and revise it as appropriate. For non-U.S. benefit plans actuarial assumptions reflect economic and market factors relevant to each country. Pension Benefits The following amounts relate to our significant pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations exceeding the fair value of plan assets. December 31, U.S. Plans Non-U.S. Plans 2018 2017 2018 2017 Projected benefit obligation $ 327 $ 371 $ 1,668 $ 1,082 Accumulated benefit obligation $ 321 $ 360 $ 1,604 $ 1,018 Fair value of plan assets   $ 873 $ 269 Accumulated benefit obligation for our U.S. defined benefit pension plans were $16.1 billion and $18.1 billion and for our Non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans were $6.1 billion and $6.9 billion at December 31, 2018 and 2017. Our asset investment strategy for our U.S. pension plans focuses on maintaining a diversified portfolio using various asset classes in order to achieve our long-term investment objectives on a risk adjusted basis. During 2018, we began to employ a de-risking strategy which increases the matching characteristics of our assets relative to our obligation. Our long-term target allocations are as follows: 45%-70% fixed income securities and cash, 35%-50% equity securities, 5%-10% real estate investments, and 10%-20% other types of investments. Equity securities include publicly-traded stock of companies located both inside and outside the United States. Fixed income securities include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, mortgage-backed securities, and U.S. Treasuries. Real estate investments include direct investments in commercial properties and investments in real estate funds. Other types of investments include investments in private equity and hedge funds that follow several different strategies. We review our assets on a regular basis to ensure that we are within the targeted asset allocation ranges and, if necessary, asset balances are adjusted back within target allocations. Our non-U.S. pension assets are typically managed by decentralized fiduciary committees with the Honeywell Corporate Investments group providing funding and investment guidance. Our non-U.S. investment policies are different for each country as local regulations, funding requirements, and financial and tax considerations are part of the funding and investment allocation process in each country. In accordance with ASU 2015-07, Fair Value Measurement (Topic 820), certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value (NAV) per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented in the following tables are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the amounts presented for the total pension benefits plan assets. 86 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

Sufficient cash or cash equivalents are held by our pension plans to cover the notional value of the futures contracts. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, our U.S. plans had contracts with notional amounts of $2,808 million and $4,188 million. At December 31, 2018 and 2017, our non-U.S. plans had contracts with notional amounts of $111 million and $133 million. In both our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans, the notional derivative exposure is related to outstanding equity and fixed income futures contracts. Common stocks, preferred stocks, real estate investment trusts, and short-term investments are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded. Corporate bonds, mortgages, asset-backed securities, and government securities are valued either by using pricing models, bids provided by brokers or dealers, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flows and as such include adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks. Certain securities are held in collective trust funds which are valued using net asset values provided by the administrators of the funds. Investments in private equity, debt, real estate and hedge funds and direct private investments are valued at estimated fair value based on quarterly financial information received from the investment advisor and/or general partner. Investments in real estate properties are valued on a quarterly basis using the income approach. Valuation estimates are periodically supplemented by third party appraisals. Our funding policy for qualified defined benefit pension plans is to contribute amounts at least sufficient to satisfy regulatory funding standards. In 2018, 2017, and 2016, we were not required to make contributions to our U.S. pension plans and no contributions were made. We are not required to make any contributions to our U.S. pension plans in 2019. In 2018, contributions of $115 million were made to our non-U.S. pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding requirements. In 2019, we expect to make contributions of cash and/or marketable securities of approximately $42 million to our non-U.S. pension plans to satisfy regulatory funding standards. Contributions for both our U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans do not reflect benefits paid directly from Company assets. 89 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

Segment Financial Data We globally manage our business operations through four reportable operating segments. Segment information is consistent with how management reviews the businesses, makes investing and resource allocation decisions and assesses operating performance. Honeywells senior management evaluates segment performance based on segment profit. Segment profit is measured as segment income (loss) before taxes excluding general corporate unallocated expense, other income (expense), interest and other financial charges, stock compensation expenses, pension and other postretirement benefits (expense), stock compensation expense and repositioning and other charges. 90 HONEYWELL INTERNATIONAL INC.

Opinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Honeywell International Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareowners equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the financial statements). We also have audited the Companys internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2018 and 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2018, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. Change in Accounting Principle As discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements, the accompanying 2017 and 2016 consolidated statements of operations have been retrospectively adjusted for the adoption of Accounting Standards Update 2017-07, CompensationRetirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost . Basis for Opinions The Companys management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 94 Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Parsippany, New Jersey February 8, 2019 We have served as the Companys auditor since 2014. 95 Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure Not Applicable. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Honeywell management maintains disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act) is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the specified time periods and accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There have been no changes that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Honeywells internal control over financial reporting that have occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2018. Our management, with the participation of our CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) at December 31, 2018. Based on these evaluations, our CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures required by paragraph (b) of Rules 13a-15 or 15d-15 were effective as of December 31, 2018. Managements Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting Honeywell management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Honeywells internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Management assessed the effectiveness of Honeywells internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal ControlIntegrated Framework (2013) . Based on this assessment, management determined that Honeywell maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018. The effectiveness of Honeywells internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data. Item 9B. Other Information Iran Threat Reduction and Syrian Human Rights Act of 2012 Under the Iran Threat Reduction and Syrian Human Rights Act of 2012, which added Section 13(r) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Honeywell is required to disclose in its periodic reports if it or any of its affiliates knowingly engaged in certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to Iran or with entities or individuals designated pursuant to certain Executive Orders. All of our activities in Iran during the year ended December 31, 2018, including the activities disclosed below, were conducted by our non-U.S. subsidiaries (i) under General License H, (ii) under General License I, or (iii) under a specific license issued by U.S. Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), and otherwise in compliance with all applicable laws, including sanctions regulations administered by OFAC. 96 In the year ended December 31, 2018, the non-U.S. subsidiaries of our UOP business, part of Performance Materials and Technologies, engaged in the following activities related to Irans oil, gas and/or petrochemical sectors:  Delivered services to Iranian counterparties pursuant to new and existing contracts, which resulted in revenue of approximately $31.3 million.  Sold non-U.S. origin products to non-U.S. third-parties for end-use in Iran pursuant to new and existing contracts, which resulted in revenue of approximately $14.0 million. Following our completion of the wind-down activities authorized by OFAC after the United States withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, we have now ceased doing business in Iran. On February 4, 2019, Krishna Mikkilineni, the Companys Senior Vice President of Engineering and Information Technology, communicated his intention to retire from the Company effective as of April 30, 2019 (the Retirement Date). In consideration for Mr. Mikkilinenis agreement to (1) provide post-Retirement Date transition services through October 31, 2019, and (2) extend the time period of his existing non-solicitation and non-compete covenants from two years to three years, the Company and Mr. Mikkilineni entered into a Retirement Agreement that provides Mr. Mikkilineni with the following benefits notwithstanding his voluntary retirement: (i) the outstanding restricted stock units previously awarded to Mr. Mikkilineni that are unvested as of the Retirement Date and that would otherwise have vested before March 1, 2020 shall remain outstanding and continue to vest as scheduled pursuant to their existing terms and conditions, including the satisfaction of any applicable Company performance requirements, (ii) all outstanding stock options that are unvested as of the Retirement Date and that would otherwise have vested before March 1, 2020 shall continue to vest as scheduled, and (iii) Mr. Mikkilineni shall receive a $2,500,000 payout from the performance stock units (PSUs) granted to him for the 20172019 PSU performance cycle (or the full payout of such PSUs if such payout is less than $2,500,000).

EQUITY COMPENSATION PLANS As of December 31, 2018 information about our equity compensation plans is as follows: Plan category Number of Shares to be Issued Upon Exercise of Outstanding Options, Warrants and Rights Weighted-Average Exercise Price of Outstanding Options, Warrants and Rights Number of Securities Remaining Available for Future Issuance Under Equity Compensation Plans (Excluding Securities Reflected in Column (a)) (a) (b) (c) Equity compensation plans approved by security holders 26,746,020 (1) $ 97.83 (2) 42,792,180 (3) Equity compensation plans not approved by security holders 328,003 (4) N/A (5) N/A (6) Total 27,074,023 $ 97.83 42,792,180 98 (1) Equity compensation plans approved by shareowners which are included in column (a) of the table are the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan, the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan, and the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan (including 22,222,860 shares of Common Stock to be issued for options; 3,617,539 RSUs subject to continued employment; and 631,082 deferred RSUs); and the 2016 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors and the 2006 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors (including 255,721 shares of Common Stock to be issued for options; and 18,818 RSUs subject to continued services). RSUs included in column (a) of the table represent the full number of RSUs awarded and outstanding whereas the number of shares of Common Stock to be issued upon vesting will be lower than what is reflected on the table because the value of shares required to meet employee tax withholding requirements are not issued. 1,110,753 growth plan units were issued and remain outstanding for the performance cycle commencing January 1, 2016 and ended December 31, 2017 pursuant to the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan. The value of this growth plan award will be paid in cash and, thus, growth plan units are not included in the table above. Because the number of future shares that may be distributed to employees participating in the Honeywell Global Stock Plan is unknown, no shares attributable to that plan are included in column (a) of the table above. (2) Column (b) relates to stock options and does not include any exercise price for RSUs because an RSUs value is dependent upon attainment of certain performance goals or continued employment or service and they are settled for shares of Common Stock on a one-for-one basis. (3) The number of shares that may be issued under the 2016 Stock Incentive Plan as of December 31, 2018 is 40,270,690 which includes the following additional shares that may again be available for issuance: shares that are settled for cash, expire, are canceled, or under similar prior plans, are tendered as option exercise price or tax withholding obligations, are reacquired with cash option exercise price or with monies attributable to any tax deduction to Honeywell upon the exercise of an option, or are under any outstanding awards assumed under any equity compensation plan of an entity acquired by Honeywell. No securities are available for future issuance under the 2011 Stock Incentive Plan or the 2006 Stock Incentive Plan. The number of shares that may be issued under the Honeywell Global Stock Plan as of December 31, 2018 is 1,807,681. This plan is an umbrella plan for three plans described below maintained solely for eligible employees of participating non-U.S. countries.  The UK Sharebuilder Plan allows an eligible UK employee to invest taxable earnings in Common Stock. The Company matches those shares and dividends paid are used to purchase additional shares of Common Stock. For the year ending December 31, 2018, 42,697 shares were credited to participants accounts under the UK Sharebuilder Plan.  The Honeywell Aerospace Ireland Share Participation Plan, the Honeywell Measurex (Ireland) Limited Group Employee Profit Sharing Plan, and the Honeywell International Technologies Limited Employee Share Ownership Plan allow eligible Irish employees to contribute a percentage of base pay and/or bonus that is invested in Common Stock. For the year ending December 31, 2018, 4,139 shares of Common Stock were credited to participants accounts under these plans. The Honeywell International Technologies Limited Employee Share Ownership Plan was part of the spinoff of the Transportation Systems business that occurred on October 1, 2018 and is no longer sponsored by Honeywell. The remaining 893,809 shares included in column (c) are shares remaining under the 2016 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors. (4) Equity compensation plans not approved by shareowners included in the table refers to the Honeywell Excess Benefit Plan and Supplemental Savings Plan. The Honeywell Excess Benefit Plan and Supplemental Savings Plan for highly compensated employees is an unfunded, non-tax qualified plan that provides benefits equal to the employee deferrals and company matching allocations that would have been provided under Honeywells U.S. tax-qualified savings plan if the Internal Revenue Code limitations on compensation and 99 contributions did not apply. The Company matching contribution is credited to participants accounts in the form of notional shares of Common Stock. The notional shares are distributed in the form of actual shares of Common Stock. The number of shares to be issued under this plan based on the value of the notional shares as of December 31, 2018 is 328,003. (5) Column (b) does not include any exercise price for notional shares allocated to employees under Honeywells equity compensation plans not approved by shareowners because all of these shares are only settled for shares of Common Stock on a one-for-one basis. (6) The amount of securities available for future issuance under the Honeywell Excess Benefit Plan and Supplemental Savings Plan is not determinable because the number of securities that may be issued under this plan depends upon the amount deferred to the plan by participants in future years.

Directors and Executive Officers of the Registrant, and such information is incorporated herein by reference. Item 14.

Business General In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“10-K” or “Report”) for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2023 (“fiscal 2023”), Starbucks Corporation (together with its subsidiaries) is referred to as “Starbucks,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our.” Starbucks is the premier roaster, marketer and retailer of specialty coffee in the world, operating in 86 markets. Formed in 1985, Starbucks Corporation’s common stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “SBUX.” We purchase and roast high-quality coffees that we sell, along with handcrafted coffee, tea and other beverages and a variety of high-quality food items through company-operated stores. We also sell a variety of coffee and tea products and license our trademarks through other channels, such as licensed stores as well as grocery and foodservice through our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestlé S.A. (“Nestlé”). In addition to our flagship Starbucks Coffee ® brand, we sell goods and services under the following brands: Teavana ® , Ethos ® , Starbucks Reserve ® and Princi ® . Our primary objective is to maintain Starbucks standing as one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world. We believe the continuous investments in our brand and operations will deliver long-term targeted revenue and income growth. This includes expansion of our global store base, adding stores in both existing, developed markets such as the U.S. and in higher growth markets such as China, as well as optimizing the mix of company-operated and licensed stores around the world. In addition, by leveraging experiences gained through our stores and elsewhere, we continue to drive beverage, equipment, process and technology innovation, including in our industry-leading digital platform. We strive to regularly offer consumers new, innovative coffee and other products in a variety of forms, across new categories, diverse channels and alternative store formats. Starbucks has always been a different kind of company – one deep with purpose, where we work together to create a positive impact in the world. With coffee at our core, we pursue ambitious goals for our partners (employees), our communities and our planet, which we believe also contributes to the long-term sustainability of our business to create a thriving business powered by thriving people for a thriving planet and communities. Our work to uplift one another extends well beyond our partners to the communities where we do business around the world. We are committed to responsible and ethical sourcing led by Coffee and Farmer Equity Practices (C.A.F.E. Practices), the Company’s third-party verification program and the cornerstone of our approach to ethical sourcing of coffee with over 98% of our coffee having been historically verified through C.A.F.E. Practices as ethically sourced. Human Capital Management We invest in the well-being – the mental, physical and financial health – of every partner through our practices, policies and benefits. This work is grounded in the belief that we are at our best when we create inclusive, supportive and welcoming environments, where we uplift one another with dignity, respect and kindness. And we are hard at work uplifting our communities and building environments in our stores that are welcoming and safe. We believe the strength of our workforce is one of the significant contributors to our success as a global brand that leads with purpose. Therefore, one of our core strategies is to invest in and support our partners to differentiate our brand, products and services in the competitive specialty coffee market, including the following areas of focus: Oversight and Management We recognize the diversity of customers, partners and communities and believe in creating an inclusive and equitable environment that represents a broad spectrum of backgrounds and cultures. Working under these principles, our Partner Resources Organization is tasked with managing employment-related matters, including recruiting and hiring, onboarding and training, compensation planning, performance management and professional development. Our Board of Directors (the “Board”) and Board committees provide oversight on certain human capital matters, including our Inclusion and Diversity programs and initiatives. As noted in its charter, our Compensation and Management Development Committee is responsible for periodically reviewing Starbucks partner resource programs and initiatives, including healthcare and other benefits, as well as our management development and succession planning practices and strategies. Our Audit and Compliance Committee works closely with the Risk Management Committee, led by Starbucks cfo and general counsel, to monitor and mitigate current and emerging labor and human capital management risks. Furthermore, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, in consultation with management, annually evaluates the effectiveness of our social responsibility policies, goals and programs, which also include partner-related issues. These reports and recommendations to the Board and its committees are part of the broader framework that guides how Starbucks should attract, retain and develop a skilled workforce that aligns with our values and strategies. We regularly conduct anonymous surveys to seek feedback from our partners on a variety of topics, including confidence in company leadership, competitiveness of our compensation and benefits package, career growth opportunities and 3 Table of Contents recommendations on how we can remain an employer of choice. The results are shared with our partners and reviewed by senior leadership, who analyze areas of progress or deterioration and prioritize actions and activities in response to this feedback to drive meaningful improvements in partner engagement. Our management and cross-functional teams also work closely to evaluate human capital management issues such as partner retention, workplace safety, harassment and bullying, as well as to implement measures to mitigate these risks. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion We are committed to creating a welcoming, supportive and inclusive environment. We are committed to advancing inclusion and racial and social equity, and we seek to further that work with intention, transparency and accountability. We continue to welcome our partners, customers, civil rights and community leaders, along with our senior vice president, talent and inclusion, to advise us along this journey. Starbucks has made specific equity commitments based on our principles of being intentional, transparent and accountable at all levels: • Being intentional in cultivating a culture of inclusion, with a focus on partner retention and development. ◦ Expanding our mentorship program designed to prioritize our partners’ sense of belonging by creating an inclusive and supportive environment. Mentors offer guidance, encouragement and a safe space for partners to share their experiences, challenges and aspirations. As of 2023, the program has welcomed nearly 1,400 partners and was expanded to include U.S. based store and district managers in 2023. • Being transparent in our approach to Inclusion and Diversity goal setting and progress. ◦ Publicly sharing workforce diversity data. ◦ Setting aspirational Inclusion and Diversity goals based on retention rates and progress towards achieving racial and ethnic diversity. Our goal is to achieve racial and ethnic diversity of at least 30% of all corporate roles and at least 40% of all retail and manufacturing roles in the U.S. by 2025, by setting broad recruiting parameters and through inclusive and legally compliant employment practices. • Holding ourselves accountable at the highest levels of the organization. ◦ Incorporating our efforts to build and retain inclusive and diverse teams into our executive compensation programs. ◦ Joining the Board Diversity Action Alliance to act alongside other companies similarly committed to increasing diverse representation on corporate boards. ◦ Publicizing self-identified race/ethnicity/gender of each member of our Board. Total Rewards We have demonstrated a history of investing in our workforce by offering competitive salaries and wages by continuously assessing the current business environment and labor market. We have consistently made enhancements in wages in order to attract talent to support our growth strategy and to elevate the customer experience. To foster a stronger sense of ownership and align the interests of partners with shareholders, restricted stock units are provided to eligible non-executive partners under our broad-based stock incentive programs. Furthermore, we offer comprehensive, locally relevant and innovative benefits to all eligible partners. In the U.S., our largest and most mature market, these include: • Comprehensive health insurance coverage is offered to partners working an average of 20 hours or more each week. • 100% upfront tuition coverage through the Starbucks College Achievement Plan for partners to earn a first-time bachelor's degree online at Arizona State University is offered to partners working an average of 20 hours or more each week. • Our Future Roast 401(k) savings plan helps partners save for their financial goal through convenient payroll deductions. Partners can contribute pre-tax or Roth after-tax dollars, and Starbucks matches 5% of eligible contributions with immediate vesting in those matching contributions. • 100% paid parental leave is available to new parents that welcome a child through birth, adoption or foster placement and work an average of 20 hours or more each week. • A Partner and Family Sick Time program is provided and allows partners to accrue paid sick time based on hours worked and use that time for themselves or family members in need of care. 4 Table of Contents • We view mental health as a fundamental part of our humanity and provide a comprehensive suite of related programs and benefits. These include a free subscription to Headspace, an online application that enables guided meditation, and 20 free mental health therapy or coaching sessions annually with Lyra. Outside of the U.S., we have provided other innovative benefits to help address market-specific needs, such as providing interest-free loans to our U.K. partners to help cover rental deposits, mental health services in Canada, and in China, an extra 14th Month Pay initiative, giving retail partners an additional month’s salary as a bonus on top of the 13th month pay that is customary in China, as well as a monthly housing subsidy for full-time Starbucks baristas and shift supervisors, and comprehensive health insurance coverage for parents of partners. Role-based Support To help our partners succeed in their roles, we emphasize continuous training and development opportunities. These include, but are not limited to, safety and security protocols, updates on new products and service offerings and deployment of technologies. Training provided through our Pour Over sessions, which are a series of inspiring talks with thought leaders to help partners understand how to bring the Starbucks Experience to life, include a wide variety of topics such as achievable goal setting, giving and receiving constructive feedback, and effective engagement with customers and communities. To help further promote an inclusive culture and to better serve our customers, we encourage U.S.-based partners to enroll in the To Be Welcoming courses we created in partnership with Arizona State University to address different forms of bias and discrimination. Pay Equity To be an employer of choice and maintain the strength of our workforce, we consistently assess the current business environment and labor market to refine our compensation and benefits programs and other resources available to our partners. We previously achieved and currently maintain 100 percent pay equity in the U.S. for women and men and people of all races for partners performing similar work. We have made a commitment to achieve gender pay equity in all company-operated markets. Further, we have formulated pay-equity principles which provide equal footing, transparency and accountability as best practices that help address known, systemic barriers to global pay equity. As of October 1, 2023, Starbucks employed approximately 381,000 people worldwide. In the U.S., Starbucks employed approximately 228,000 people, with approximately 219,000 in company-operated stores and the remainder in corporate support, store development, roasting, manufacturing, warehousing and distribution operations. Approximately 153,000 employees were employed outside of the U.S., with approximately 148,000 in company-operated stores and the remainder in regional support operations. Approximately 3.6% of Starbucks partners in U.S. company-operated stores are represented by unions. We believe our efforts in managing our workforce have been effective, evidenced by improved retention, lower turnover, and employee satisfaction during fiscal 2023.

Segment Financial Information Segment information is prepared on the same basis that our management reviews financial information for operational decision-making purposes. We have three reportable operating segments: 1) North America, which is inclusive of the U.S. and Canada; 2) International, which is inclusive of China, Japan, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East and Africa, Latin America and Caribbean; and 3) Channel Development. Non-reportable operating segments and unallocated corporate expenses are reported within Corporate and Other. Revenues from our reportable operating segments as a percentage of total net revenues for fiscal 2023 were as follows: North America (74%), International (21%) and Channel Development (5%). Our North America and International segments include both company-operated and licensed stores. Our North America segment is our most mature business and has achieved significant scale. Certain markets within our International operations are in various stages of development and may require more extensive support, relative to their current levels of revenue and operating income, than our North America operations. Our Channel Development segment includes roasted whole bean and ground coffees, Starbucks- and Teavana-branded single-serve products, a variety of ready-to-drink beverages, such as Frappuccino ® and Starbucks Doubleshot ® , foodservice products and other branded products sold worldwide outside of our company-operated and licensed stores. A large portion of our Channel Development business operates under a licensed model of the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestlé, while our global ready-to-drink businesses operate under collaborative relationships with PepsiCo, Inc., Tingyi-Ashi Beverages Holding Co., Ltd., Arla Foods amba, Nestlé and others. 6 Table of Contents Revenue Components We generate the majority of our revenues through company-operated stores and licensed stores. Company-operated and Licensed Store Summary as of October 1, 2023: North America As a % of Total North America Stores International As a % of Total International Stores Total As a % of Total Stores Company-operated stores 10,628 60 % 8,964 44 % 19,592 52 % Licensed stores 7,182 40 % 11,264 56 % 18,446 48 % Total 17,810 100 % 20,228 100 % 38,038 100 % The mix of company-operated versus licensed stores in a given market generally varies based on several factors, including our ability to access desirable local retail space, the complexity, profitability and expected ultimate size of the market for Starbucks and our ability to leverage the support infrastructure within a geographic region. Company-operated Stores Revenue from company-operated stores accounted for 82% of total net revenues during fiscal 2023. Our retail objective is to be the leading retailer and brand of coffee and tea in each of our target markets by selling the finest quality coffee, tea and related products, as well as complementary food offerings, and by providing each customer with a unique Starbucks Experience . The Starbucks Experience is built upon superior customer service, convenience and a seamless digital experience as well as safe, clean and well-maintained stores that reflect the personalities of the communities in which they operate, thereby building a high degree of customer loyalty. Our strategy for expanding our global retail business is to increase our category share in a disciplined manner, by selectively opening additional stores in new and existing markets, as well as increasing sales in existing stores, to support our long-term strategic objective to maintain Starbucks standing as one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world. Store growth in specific existing markets will vary due to many factors, including expected financial returns, the maturity of the market, economic conditions, consumer behavior and the local business environment. Company-operated store data for the fiscal year-ended October 1, 2023: Stores Open as of Stores Open as of Oct 2, 2022 Opened Closed Transfers Net Oct 1, 2023 North America: U.S. 9,265 483 (103) — 380 9,645 Canada 946 43 (12) — 31 977 Siren Retail 5 1 — — 1 6 Total North America 10,216 527 (115) — 412 10,628 International: China 6,019 857 (72) — 785 6,804 Japan 1,630 110 (8) 1 103 1,733 U.K. 318 42 (5) — 37 355 All Other 65 3 (1) — 2 67 Siren Retail 5 — — — — 5 Total International 8,037 1,012 (86) 1 927 8,964 Total company-operated 18,253 1,539 (201) 1 1,339 19,592 Starbucks company-operated stores are typically located in high-traffic, high-visibility locations. Our ability to vary the size and format of our stores allows us to locate them in or near a variety of settings, including downtown and suburban retail centers, office buildings, university campuses and rural and off-highway locations. We are continuing the expansion of our stores, particularly drive-thru formats that provide a higher degree of access and convenience, and alternative store formats, which are designed to provide a more streamlined customer experience in dense metropolitan areas. In fiscal 2022, we announced our plan in the U.S. market to increase efficiency while elevating the partner and customer experience (the “Reinvention Plan”). We believe the company-operated market investments in partner wages and trainings have 7 Table of Contents increased retention and productivity while the acceleration of purpose-built store concepts and innovations in technologies have provided additional convenience and connection with our customers. In our major international markets, we also continue to invest in technology and establish partnerships with third parties with relevant expertise to increase digital adoption to provide convenience and elevate the customer experience. Additionally, as our business has evolved, we have built an omni-channel business to meet more occasions as we serve a more diverse customer base through growth in online, e-commerce, delivery, mobile ordering and the in-store experience. In China, we leverage platforms such as Starbucks Now TM stores to enable a seamless integration of physical and digital customer touchpoints. Orders may be placed in advance through the Starbucks Mobile App or Starbucks Delivers TM and can be conveniently picked up by customers and delivery providers in these express retail format locations. These strategies align closely with rapidly evolving customer preferences, including higher levels of mobile ordering, more contactless pick-up experiences and reduced in-store congestion. Our investments in a digital third place offer members access to new benefits, a digital community and immersive coffee experiences, giving our customers new ways to experience and connect with Starbucks. We believe our continued efforts to transform our store portfolio and elevate technology will enhance the customer experience and position Starbucks for long-term growth. Retail sales mix by product type for company-operated stores: Fiscal Year Ended Oct 1, 2023 Oct 2, 2022 Oct 3, 2021 Beverages 74 % 74 % 74 % Food 22 % 22 % 21 % Other (1) 4 % 4 % 5 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % (1) “Other” primarily consists of sales of serveware, packaged and single-serve coffees and teas and ready-to-drink beverages, among other items. Stored Value Cards and Loyalty Program The Starbucks Card, our branded stored value card program, is designed to provide customers with a convenient payment method, support gifting and increase the frequency of store visits by cardholders, in part through the related Starbucks ® Rewards loyalty program where available, as discussed below. Stored value cards are issued to customers when they initially load them with an account balance. They can be obtained in our company-operated and most licensed stores in North America, China, Japan and many of our other markets in our International segment. Stored value cards can also be obtained online, via the Starbucks ® Mobile App and through other U.S. and international retailers. Customers may access their card balances by utilizing their stored value card or the Starbucks Mobile App in participating stores. In nearly all markets, including the U.S. and Canada, customers who register their Starbucks Cards are automatically enrolled in the Starbucks Rewards program. Registered members can receive various benefits depending on factors such as the number of reward points (“Stars”) earned. In addition to using their Starbucks Cards, Starbucks Rewards members can earn Stars by paying with cash, credit or debit cards, or selected mobile wallets at all company-operated stores and a majority of licensed stores in North America. Using the Mobile Order and Pay functionality of the Starbucks Mobile App, customers can also place orders in advance for pick-up at certain participating locations in several markets. Refer to Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, for further discussion of our stored value cards and loyalty program. Licensed Stores Revenues from our licensed stores accounted for 13% of total net revenues in fiscal 2023. Licensed stores generally have a lower gross margin and a higher operating margin than company-operated stores. Under the licensed model, Starbucks receives a margin on branded products and supplies sold to the licensed store operator along with a royalty on retail sales. Licensees are responsible for operating costs and capital investments, which more than offset the lower revenues we receive under the licensed store model. In our licensed store operations, we seek to leverage the expertise of our local partners and share our operating and store development experience. Licensees provide improved, and at times the only, access to desirable retail space. Most licensees are prominent retailers with in-depth market knowledge and access. As part of these arrangements, we sell coffee, tea, food and related products to licensees for resale to customers and receive royalties and license fees from the licensees. We also sell certain equipment, such as coffee brewers and espresso machines, to our licensees for use in their operations. Licensee employees working in licensed retail locations are required to follow our detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to employees in company-operated stores. In a limited number of international markets, we also use traditional franchising and include these stores in the results of operations from our other licensed stores. 8 Table of Contents Licensed store data for the fiscal year-ended October 1, 2023: Stores Open as of Stores Open as of Oct 2, 2022 Opened Closed Transfers Net Oct 1, 2023 North America: U.S. 6,608 206 (113) — 93 6,701 Canada 471 17 (7) — 10 481 Total North America 7,079 223 (120) — 103 7,182 International: Korea 1,750 153 (33) — 120 1,870 Latin America 1,549 108 (8) — 100 1,649 U.K. 838 77 (4) — 73 911 Turkey 604 81 (9) — 72 676 Taiwan 544 30 (11) — 19 563 Indonesia 523 58 — — 58 581 Thailand 446 29 (1) — 28 474 Philippines 418 29 — — 29 447 All Other 3,707 469 (82) (1) 386 4,093 Total International 10,379 1,034 (148) (1) 885 11,264 Total licensed 17,458 1,257 (268) (1) 988 18,446 Other Revenues Other revenues primarily are recorded in our Channel Development segment and include sales of packaged coffee, tea and ready-to-drink beverages to customers outside of our company-operated and licensed stores, as well as royalties received from Nestlé under the Global Coffee Alliance and other collaborative partnerships. Product Supply Starbucks is committed to selling the finest whole bean coffees and coffee beverages. To help ensure compliance with our rigorous coffee standards, we generally control substantially all coffee purchasing, roasting and packaging and the global distribution of coffee used in our operations. Nestlé controls distribution of Starbucks packaged coffee products outside of Starbucks stores through the Global Coffee Alliance, and in some cases, also roasts and packages these products. We purchase green coffee beans from multiple coffee-producing regions around the world and custom roast them to our exacting standards for our many blends and single-origin coffees. The price of coffee is subject to significant volatility. Although most coffee trades in the commodity market, high-altitude arabica coffee of the quality sought by Starbucks tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the “C” coffee commodity price. Both the premium and the commodity price depend upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase. Supply and price can be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, including weather, water supply quality and availability throughout the coffee production chain, natural disasters, crop disease and pests, general increase in farm inputs and costs of production, inventory levels and political and economic conditions. Climate change may further exacerbate many of these factors. Price is also impacted by trading activities in the arabica coffee futures market, including hedge funds and commodity index funds. In addition, green coffee prices have been affected in the past, and may be affected in the future, by the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies. We buy coffee using fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed purchase commitments, depending on market conditions, to secure an adequate supply of quality green coffee. We also utilize forward contracts, futures contracts and collars to hedge “C” price exposure under our price-to-be-fixed green coffee contracts and our long-term forecasted coffee demand where underlying fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed contracts are not yet available. Total purchase commitments, together with existing inventory, are expected to provide an adequate supply of green coffee through fiscal 2024. We depend upon our relationships with coffee producers, outside trading companies and exporters for our supply of green coffee. We believe, based on relationships established with our suppliers, the risk of non-delivery on such purchase commitments is remote. 9 Table of Contents To help ensure the future supply of high-quality green coffee and to reinforce our leadership role in the coffee industry, Starbucks operates ten farmer support centers, including our China Farmer Support Center located in the Yunnan Province of this high-growth market. Farmer support centers are staffed with agronomists and sustainability experts who work with coffee farming communities to promote best practices in coffee production designed to improve both coffee quality and yields and agronomy support to address climate change and other impacts. In addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy, particularly fluid milk, and to a lesser degree, plant-based dairy-free alternative products, such as oat milk and almond milk, to support the needs of our company-operated stores. We believe, based on relationships established with our dairy and plant-based dairy-free suppliers, that the risk of non-delivery of sufficient fluid milk and plant-based dairy-free alternatives to support our stores generally is remote. Products other than whole bean coffees and coffee beverages sold in Starbucks stores include tea and a number of ready-to-drink beverages that are purchased from several specialty suppliers, usually under long-term supply contracts. Food products, such as pastries, breakfast sandwiches and lunch items, are purchased from national, regional and local sources. We also purchase a broad range of paper and plastic products, such as cups and cutlery, from several companies to support the needs of our retail stores as well as our manufacturing and distribution operations. We are also expanding our use of reusable packaging to reduce landfill waste. We believe, based on relationships established with these suppliers and manufacturers, that the risk of non-delivery of sufficient amounts of these items generally is remote. Competition Our primary competitors for coffee beverage sales are specialty coffee retailers and shops. We believe that our customers choose among specialty coffee retailers and shops primarily on the basis of product quality, brand reputation, service and convenience, as well as price. We continue to experience direct competition from large competitors in the quick-service restaurant sector and the ready-to-drink coffee beverage market, in addition to both well-established and start-up companies in many international markets. We also compete with restaurants and other specialty retailers for prime retail locations and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores. Our coffee and tea products sold through our Channel Development segment compete directly against specialty coffees and teas sold through grocery stores, warehouse clubs, specialty retailers, convenience stores and foodservice accounts and compete indirectly against all other coffees and teas on the market. Trademarks, Copyrights, Patents and Domain Names Starbucks owns and has applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and in other countries throughout the world. Some of our trademarks, including Starbucks, the Starbucks logo, Starbucks Reserve and Frappuccino are of material importance. The duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained. We own numerous copyrights for items such as product packaging, promotional materials, in-store graphics and training materials. We also hold patents on certain products, systems and designs which have an average remaining useful life of approximately five years. In addition, Starbucks has registered and maintains numerous Internet domain names, including “Starbucks.com,” “Starbucks.net” and “Starbucksreserve.com.” Seasonality and Quarterly Results Our business is subject to moderate seasonal fluctuations, of which our second fiscal quarter typically experiences lower revenues and operating income. Additionally, as Starbucks Cards are issued to and loaded by customers during the holiday season, we tend to have higher cash flows from operations during the first quarter of the fiscal year. However, since revenues from Starbucks Cards are recognized upon redemption and not when cash is loaded onto the Card, the impact of seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings is much less pronounced. As a result of moderate seasonal fluctuations, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year. Government Regulation As a company with global operations, we are subject to the laws and regulations of the United States and the multiple foreign jurisdictions in which we operate as well as the rules, reporting obligations and interpretations of all such requirements and obligations by various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions. In addition, changes to such laws, regulations, rules, reporting obligations and related compliance obligations could result in significant costs but are not expected to have a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position as compared to prior periods. 10 Table of Contents Available Information Starbucks Annual Report on Form 10-K reports, along with all other reports and amendments filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), are publicly available free of charge on the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.starbucks.com as soon as reasonably practicable after these materials are filed with or furnished to the SEC. In addition, the SEC maintains an internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov. We also use our website as a tool to disclose important information about the company and comply with our disclosure obligations under Regulation Fair Disclosure. Our corporate governance policies, code of ethics and Board committee charters and policies are also posted on the Investor Relations section of Starbucks website. The information on our website (or any webpages referenced in this Annual Report on Form 10-K) is not part of this or any other report Starbucks files with, or furnishes to, the SEC. Item 1A. Risk Factors You should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations section, the Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk section and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. If any of the risks and uncertainties described in the cautionary factors described below actually occur or continue to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. The considerations and risks that follow are organized within relevant headings but may be relevant to other headings as well. Moreover, the risks below are not the only risks we face and additional risks not currently known to us or that we presently deem immaterial may emerge or become material at any time and may negatively impact our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations or the trading price of our common stock. It is not possible for management to predict all such risks, nor can it assess the impact of all such risks on Starbucks business or the extent to which any risk, or combination of risks, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. Risks Related to Brand Relevance and Brand Execution • Our success depends substantially on the value of our brands and failure to preserve their value could have a negative impact on our financial results. We believe we have built an excellent reputation globally for the quality of our products, for delivery of a consistently positive consumer experience and for our global social and environmental impact programs. The Starbucks brand is recognized throughout most of the world, and we have received high ratings in global brand value studies. To be successful in the future, particularly outside of the U.S. where the Starbucks brand and our other brands are less well-known, we believe we must preserve, grow and leverage the value of our brands across all sales channels. Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities. Erosion of trust in our brand value can be caused by isolated or recurring incidents originating both from us or our business partners, or from external events. Such incidents can potentially trigger boycotts of our stores or result in civil or criminal liability and can have a negative impact on our financial results. Incidents that can erode trust in our brand value include actual or perceived breaches of privacy or violations of domestic or international privacy laws, contaminated food, product recalls, store employees or other food handlers infected with communicable diseases, safety-related incidents or other potential incidents discussed in this risk factors section. The impact of such incidents may be exacerbated if they receive considerable publicity, including rapidly through social or digital media (including for malicious reasons) or result in litigation. Consumer demand for our products and our brand value could diminish significantly if we, our employees, licensees or other business partners fail to preserve the quality of our products, act or are perceived to act in an unethical, illegal, racially-biased, unequal, inequitable or socially irresponsible manner, including with respect to the sourcing, content or sale of our products, service and treatment of customers at Starbucks stores, treatment of employees, including our responses to unionization efforts, or the use of customer data for general or direct marketing or other purposes. Furthermore, if we are not effective in making sufficient progress toward our social and environmental program goals or in executing on our Reinvention Plan, consumer trust in our brand may suffer, and this perception could result in negative publicity or litigation. Additionally, if we fail to comply with laws and regulations, take controversial positions or actions or fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience in each of our markets, including by failing to invest in the right balance of wages and benefits to attract and retain employees that represent the brand well or to foster an inclusive and diverse environment, our brand value may be diminished. The ongoing relevance of our brand may depend on making sufficient progress toward our social and environmental program goals as well as the successful execution of the Reinvention Plan, each of which requires company-wide coordination and alignment. We are working to manage risks and costs to us, our licensees and our supply chain of any effects of climate change as well as diminishing energy and water resources. These risks include any increased public focus, including by governmental 11 Table of Contents and nongovernmental organizations, on these and other environmental sustainability matters, including packaging and waste, animal health and welfare, deforestation and land use. These risks may also include any increased pressure to make commitments or set goals and take actions to meet them, which could expose us to market, operational and execution costs or risks. Some third parties may object to the scope or nature of our social and environmental program initiatives or goals, or any revisions to these initiatives or goals, which could give rise to negative responses by governmental actors (such as retaliatory legislative treatment) or consumers (such as boycotts or negative publicity campaigns) that could adversely affect our brand value. • We may not be successful in our marketing, promotional and advertising plans and pricing strategies. Our continued success depends in part on our ability to adjust our marketing, promotional and advertising plans and pricing strategy to respond quickly and effectively to shifting economic and competitive conditions as well as evolving customer preferences. We operate in a complex and costly marketing, promotional and advertising environment. Competition to attract and retain high-quality marketing partners and endorsers has increased. Our decisions to collaborate or to cease collaborating with certain endorsers or marketing partners in light of actions taken or statements made by them could seriously harm our brand image with consumers and, as a result, could have an adverse effect on our sales and financial condition. Our marketing, promotional and advertising programs may not be successful in reaching consumers in the way we intend. Our success depends in part on whether the allocation of our advertising, promotional and marketing resources across different channels, including digital, allows us to reach consumers effectively and efficiently, and in ways that are meaningful to them. If the advertising, promotional and marketing programs or our pricing strategies are not successful, or are not as successful as those of our competitors, our sales and market share could decrease. Finally, consumers are focusing more on sustainability and the environmental impacts of operations, as well as the alignment of Starbucks actions with its stated mission, values and promises. An inability to meet consumer expectations with respect to these issues could adversely affect our financial results. Risks Related to Our Business • If our business partners and third-party providers do not satisfactorily fulfill their responsibilities and commitments, it could damage our brand and our financial results could suffer. Our global business strategy, including our plans for new stores, branded products and other initiatives, relies significantly on a variety of business partners, including licensee and joint venture relationships, third-party manufacturers, distributors and retailers, particularly for our entire global Channel Development business. Licensees, retailers and foodservice operators are often authorized to use our logos and provide branded food, beverage and other products directly to customers. We believe our customers expect the same quality of service regardless of whether they visit a licensed or company-operated store, so we provide training and support to, and monitor the operations of, certain of these licensees and other business partners. However, the product quality and service they deliver may still be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control, including financial constraints or solvency, adherence to sanitation protocols and guidance, labor shortages and other factors. We do not have direct control over our business partners and may not have visibility into their practices. We also source our food, beverage and other products from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners, and in certain cases such products are produced or sourced by our licensees directly. We do not monitor the quality of non-Starbucks products served by foodservice operators we have authorized to use our logos and provide branded products as part of their foodservice business. Additionally, inconsistent uses of our brand and other of our intellectual property assets, as well as failure to protect our intellectual property, can erode consumer trust and our brand value and have a material negative impact on our financial results. • Incidents involving food or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, adulteration, contamination or mislabeling, whether or not accurate, as well as adverse public or medical opinions about the health effects of consuming our products, could harm our business. Instances or reports, whether true or not, of unclean water supply or food-safety issues, such as food or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, adulteration, contamination or mislabeling, either during growing, manufacturing, packaging, storing or preparation, have in the past severely injured the reputations of companies in the food and beverage processing, grocery and quick-service restaurant sectors. Any report linking us to such instances could severely hurt our sales and could possibly lead to product liability claims, litigation (including class actions), temporary store closures, or other adverse consequences. Clean water is critical to the preparation of coffee, tea and other beverages, as well as ice for our cold beverages, and our ability to ensure adequate supplies of clean water and ice to our stores can be limited, particularly in some international locations. We are also continuing to incorporate more products in our food and beverage lineup that require freezing or refrigeration, which increases the risk of food safety related incidents if correct temperatures are not maintained due to mechanical malfunction or human error. 12 Table of Contents We also face risk by relying on third-party food suppliers to provide and transport ingredients and finished products to our stores. The product quality and service they deliver may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control and it may be difficult to detect contamination or other defects in these products. There is greater risk from those we do not monitor, or do not monitor as closely. Furthermore, stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic, there are stricter health regulations and guidelines and increased public concern over food safety standards and controls. Potential food safety incidents, whether at our stores or involving our business partners, could lead to wide public exposure, which could materially harm our business. In addition, instances of food or beverage-safety issues, even those involving solely the restaurants or stores of competitors or of suppliers or distributors (regardless of whether we use or have used those suppliers or distributors), could adversely affect our sales on a regional or global basis by resulting in negative publicity about us or the foodservice industry in general. A decrease in customer traffic as a result of food-safety concerns or negative publicity, or as a result of a temporary closure of any of our stores, product recalls, viral-contaminated food or beverage claims or other food or beverage-safety claims or litigation, could materially harm our business and results of operations. • We may not be successful in implementing important strategic initiatives or effectively managing growth, which may have an adverse impact on our business and financial results. There is no assurance that we will be able to implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations or that they will generate expected returns, which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results. These strategic initiatives, which include our Reinvention Plan, are designed to create growth, improve our results of operations and drive long-term shareholder value, and include: • being an employer of choice and investing in employees to deliver a superior customer experience; • building our leadership position around coffee; • driving convenience, brand engagement and digital relationships through our mobile, loyalty, delivery and digital capabilities both domestically and internationally; • simplifying store administrative tasks to allow store partners to better engage with customers; • increasing the scale of the Starbucks store footprint with disciplined global expansion and introducing flexible and unique store formats, including the accelerated development of alternative store formats (such as Starbucks Pickup stores, Starbucks Now stores and curbside pickup); • adjusting rapidly to changing customer preferences and behaviors as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, changing economic conditions, increased global interest rates and inflation; • moving to a more licensed store model in certain markets and a more company-operated model in other markets; • creating new occasions in stores across all dayparts with new product offerings, including our growing lunch food and beverage product lineup; • continuing the global growth of our Channel Development business through our supply, distribution and licensing agreements with Nestlé and other Channel Development business partners; • delivering continued growth in our cold beverage business; • working to address the potential effects of climate change and the sustainability of our business; and • reducing our operating costs, particularly general and administrative expenses. In addition to other factors listed in this risk factors section, factors that may adversely affect the successful implementation of these initiatives, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results, include the following: • imposition of additional taxes by jurisdictions, such as on certain types of beverages or based on number of employees; • construction cost increases associated with new store openings and remodeling of existing stores; delays in store openings for reasons beyond our control, such as potential shortages of materials and labor and delays in permits, or a lack of desirable real estate locations available for lease at reasonable rates, either of which could keep us from meeting annual store opening targets in the U.S. and internationally; • governmental regulations or other health guidelines concerning operations of stores, including due to public health emergencies; • not successfully scaling our supply chain infrastructure as our product offerings increase and as we continue to expand, including our emphasis on a broad range of high-quality food offerings; 13 Table of Contents • not successfully adapting to customer or market factors affecting our supply chain as we work to address sustainability and climate change; • the deterioration in our credit ratings, which could limit the availability of additional financing and increase the cost of obtaining financing to fund our initiatives; and • geopolitical instability and international conflicts. Effectively managing growth can be challenging, particularly as we continue to expand in international markets where we must balance the need for flexibility and a degree of autonomy for local management against the need for consistency with our goals, policies and standards. If we are not successful in implementing our strategic initiatives, or, in the event we undertake large acquisitions, integrations and divestitures, we may be required to evaluate whether certain assets, including goodwill and other intangibles, have become impaired. In the event we record an impairment charge, it could have a material impact on our financial results. • Evolving consumer preferences and tastes may adversely affect our business. Our continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain customers. Our financial results could be adversely affected by a shift in consumer spending away from outside-the-home food and beverages (such as a reduction in discretionary spending as a result of the resumption of student loan payments); lack of customer acceptance of new products (including due to price increases necessary to cover the costs of new products or higher input costs), brands (such as the global expansion of the Starbucks brand) and platforms (such as features of our mobile technology, changes in our loyalty rewards programs and our delivery services initiatives); or customers reducing their demand for our current offerings as new products are introduced. In addition, some of our products contain caffeine, dairy products, sugar and other compounds and allergens, the health effects of which are the subject of public and regulatory scrutiny, including the suggestion of linkages to a variety of adverse health effects. Particularly in the U.S., there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks, including obesity, as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food and beverage products. An unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in our products, whether accurate or not, imposition of additional taxes on certain types of food and beverage components, or negative publicity or litigation arising from certain health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our beverages and food products and could materially harm our business and results of operations. Our financial results have been, and could continue to be, adversely affected by changes in macroeconomic conditions, including increases in real estate costs in certain domestic and international markets, inflationary pressures and changes in prevailing interest rates, disruptions to our supply chain, changes in governmental rules and approaches to taxation, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Such changes could affect consumer behavior and their ability or willingness to spend discretionary income on our products . Furthermore, our financial results have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the persisting impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the disruption of customer routines, changes to employer “work-from-home” policies and changes in consumer behavior and the ability or willingness to spend discretionary income on our products. Risks Related to Operating a Global Business • We are highly dependent on the financial performance of our North America operating segment. Our financial performance is highly dependent on our North America operating segment, which comprised approximately 74% of consolidated total net revenues in fiscal year 2023. If the North America operating segment revenue trends slow or decline, especially in our U.S. market, our other segments may be unable to make up any significant shortfall and our business and financial results could be adversely affected. And because the North America segment is relatively mature and produces the large majority of our operating cash flows, such a slowdown or decline could result in reduced cash flows for funding the expansion of our international businesses and other initiatives and for returning cash to shareholders. • We are increasingly dependent on the success of certain international markets in order to achieve our growth targets. Our future growth increasingly depends on the growth and sustained profitability of certain international markets. Some or all of our international market business units (“MBUs”), which we generally define by the countries in which they operate, may not be successful in their operations or in achieving expected growth, which ultimately requires achieving consistent, stable net revenues and earnings. The performance of these international operations may be adversely affected by economic downturns in one or more of the countries in which our large MBUs operate. A decline in performance of one or more of our significant international MBUs could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results. The International segment is a significant profit center driving our global returns, along with our North America segment. In particular, our China MBU contributes meaningfully to both consolidated and International net revenues and operating income. China is expected to be our fastest growing market in terms of percentage growth, our second largest market overall and 100% company-owned. Due to the significance of our China market for our profit and growth, we are exposed to risks in China, including the risks mentioned elsewhere and the following: 14 Table of Contents • the effects of current U.S.-China relations, including rounds of tariff increases and retaliations and increasing restrictive regulations, potential boycotts and increasing anti-Americanism; • escalating U.S.-China tension and increasing political sensitivities in China; • the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental regulations and restrictions on our operations in China; • entry of new competitors to the specialty coffee market in China; • changes in economic conditions in China and potential negative effects to the growth of its middle class, wages, labor, inflation, discretionary spending and real estate and supply chain costs; • ongoing government regulatory reform, including relating to public health, food safety, tariffs and tax, sustainability and responses to climate change, which result in regulatory uncertainty as well as potential significant increases in compliance costs; • data-privacy and cybersecurity risks unique to the conduct of business in China; and • food-safety related matters, including compliance with food-safety regulations and ability to ensure product quality and safety. Additionally, some factors that will be critical to the success of our international operations overall are different than those affecting our U.S. stores and licensees. Tastes naturally vary by region, and consumers in some MBUs may not embrace our products to the same extent as consumers in the U.S. or other international markets. Occupancy costs and store operating expenses can be higher internationally than in the U.S. due to higher rents for prime store locations or costs of compliance with country-specific regulatory requirements. Because many of our international operations are in an early phase of development, operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues are often higher compared to more developed operations. • We face risks as a global business that could adversely affect our financial performance. We operate in 86 markets globally. Our international operations are also subject to additional inherent risks of conducting business abroad, such as: • foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, or requirements to transact in specific currencies; • changes or uncertainties in economic, legal, regulatory, social and political conditions in our markets, as well as negative effects on U.S. businesses due to increasing anti-American sentiment in certain markets; • interpretation and application of laws and regulations, including tax, tariffs, labor, merchandise, anti-bribery and privacy laws and regulations; • restrictive actions of foreign or U.S. governmental authorities affecting trade and foreign investment, especially during periods of heightened tension between the U.S. and such foreign governmental authorities, including protective measures such as export and customs duties and tariffs, government intervention favoring local competitors and restrictions on the level of foreign ownership; • import or other business licensing requirements; • the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights; • limitations on the repatriation of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions due to current or new U.S. and international regulations; • in developing economies, the growth rate in the portion of the population achieving sufficient levels of disposable income may not be as fast as we forecast; • difficulty in staffing, developing and managing foreign operations and supply chain logistics, including ensuring the consistency of product quality and service, due to governmental actions affecting supply chain logistics, distance, language and cultural differences, as well as challenges in recruiting and retaining high-quality employees in local markets; • local laws that make it more expensive and complex to negotiate with, retain or terminate employees; • local regulations, health guidelines and safety protocols affecting our operations; and • delays in store openings for reasons beyond our control, competition with locally relevant competitors or a lack of desirable real estate locations available for lease at reasonable rates, any of which could keep us from meeting annual store opening targets and, in turn, negatively impact net revenues, operating income and earnings per share. 15 Table of Contents Moreover, many of the foregoing risks are particularly acute in developing countries, which are important to our long-term growth prospects. An inability to manage effectively the risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our business and financial results. • Our reliance on key business partners may adversely affect our business and operations. The growth of our business relies on the ability of our licensee partners to implement our growth platforms and product innovations as well as on the degree to which we are able to enter into, maintain, develop and negotiate appropriate terms and conditions of, and enforce, commercial and other agreements and the performance of our business partners under such agreements. Our international licensees may face capital constraints or other factors that may limit the speed at which they are able to expand and develop in a certain market. Our Channel Development business is heavily reliant on Nestlé, which has the right to sell and distribute our packaged goods and foodservice products to retailers and operators, with few exceptions. If Nestlé fails to perform its distribution and marketing commitments under our agreements and/or fails to support, protect and grow our brand in Channel Development, our Channel Development business could be adversely impacted for a period of time, present long-term challenges to our brand, limit our ability to grow our Channel Development business and have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results. Additionally, the growth of our Channel Development business is in part dependent on the level of discretionary support provided by our retail and licensed store businesses. There are generally a relatively small number of licensee partners operating in specific markets. If they are not able to access sufficient funds or financing, or are otherwise unable or unwilling to successfully operate and grow their businesses, it could have a material adverse effect on our results in the applicable markets. Risks Related to Supply Chain • Increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities or decreases in the availability of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results. The availability and prices of coffee beans and other commodities are subject to significant volatility. We purchase, roast and sell high-quality whole bean arabica coffee beans and related coffee products. The high-quality arabica coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the “C” price. This premium depends upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and the amount of the premium can vary significantly. Increases in the “C” coffee commodity price increase the price of high-quality arabica coffee and also impact our ability to enter into fixed-price purchase commitments. We frequently enter into supply contracts whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore price, at which the base “C” coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established. The supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, such as weather, water supply quality and availability throughout the coffee production chain, natural disasters, crop disease and pests, general increase in farm inputs and costs of production, inventory levels, political and economic conditions and the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies. Climate change may further exacerbate many of these factors. Speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices. For example, extreme weather conditions such as drought or frost in Brazil have impacted coffee prices in the past, and in the likely event that such weather conditions were to reoccur in the future, they would have similar consequences on coffee price volatility. Because of the significance of coffee beans to our operations, combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities, increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. In addition, if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or due to a worldwide or regional shortage, we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee, which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial performance. We also purchase significant amounts of dairy products, particularly fluid milk, and to a lesser degree, plant-based dairy-free alternative products, such as oat milk and almond milk, to support the needs of our company-operated retail stores. Additionally, other commodities, including tea and those related to food and beverage inputs, such as cocoa, produce, baking ingredients, meats, eggs and energy, as well as the processing of these inputs, are important to our operations. Increases in the cost of dairy products and other commodities, or lack of availability, whether due to supply shortages, delays or interruptions in processing, or otherwise, especially in international markets, could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. Similarly, increases in the cost of, or lack of availability, whether due to supply shortages, delays or interruptions in the processing of plant-based alternatives could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. • Interruption of our supply chain could affect our ability to produce or deliver our products and could negatively impact our business and profitability. 16 Table of Contents Any material interruption in our supply chain, such as material interruption of roasted coffee supply due to the casualty loss of any of our roasting plants, interruptions in service by our third-party logistic service providers or common carriers that ship goods within our distribution channels, trade restrictions, such as increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes or customs restrictions, pandemics, social or labor unrest, labor shortages, natural disasters or political disputes and military conflicts that cause a material disruption in our supply chain could have a negative material impact on our business and our profitability. Additionally, our food, beverage and other products are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners in our supply chain operations, and in certain cases are produced or sourced by our licensees directly. We rely on these suppliers to provide high-quality products and to comply with applicable laws. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge as we increase our fresh and prepared food offerings, especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the U.S. and from countries or regions with diminished infrastructure, developing or failing economies or which are experiencing political instability or social unrest. For certain products, we may rely on one or very few suppliers. A supplier's failure to meet our standards, provide products in a timely and efficient manner or comply with applicable laws is beyond our control. These issues could have a material negative impact on our business and profitability. Risks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions • Our financial condition and results of operations are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, a number of macroeconomic and other factors, many of which are also largely outside our control. Our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to a number of macroeconomic and other factors, many of which are largely outside our control. Any one or more of the factors listed below or described elsewhere in this risk factors section could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations: • increases in real estate costs in certain domestic and international markets; • inflationary pressures and changes in prevailing interest rates; • disruptions to our supply chain; • changes in governmental rules and approaches to taxation; • fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; • adverse outcomes of litigation; • severe weather or other natural or man-made disasters affecting a large market or several closely located markets that may temporarily but significantly affect our retail business in such markets; • changes in climate, including changes to the frequency or severity of extreme weather events, that impact the price and availability or cost of goods and services, energy and other materials throughout our supply chain; and • especially in our largest markets, including the U.S. and China, labor discord or disruption, geopolitical events, war, terrorism (including incidents targeting us), political instability, acts of public violence, boycotts, increasing anti-American sentiment in certain markets, hostilities and social unrest and health pandemics that lead to avoidance of public places or restrictions on public gatherings such as in our stores. Unfavorable economic conditions could also adversely affect our suppliers and licensees, who in turn could experience cash flow problems, more costly or unavailable financing, credit defaults and other financial hardships. This could lead to supplier or licensee insolvency, increase our bad debt expense, or cause us to increase the levels of unsecured credit that we provide to suppliers and licensees. Further, if any of our licensees becomes insolvent this could result in our exit from a particular market, and negatively impact our reputation. For example, one of our licensees is experiencing financial solvency issues, which may require the Company to expend capital resources to help fund their operating expenses in the short term. • Economic conditions in the U.S. and international markets could adversely affect our business and financial results. As a retailer that is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending, our results of operations are sensitive to changes in or uncertainty about macroeconomic conditions. A continued economic downturn or recession, or slowing or stalled recovery therefrom, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our customers may have or in the future have less money for discretionary purchases and may stop or reduce their purchases of our products or switch to Starbucks or competitors’ lower-priced products as a result of various factors, including job losses, inflation, changes in prevailing interest rates, higher taxes, reduced access to credit, changes in federal economic policy, a global health pandemic, international trade disputes or geopolitical instability. We may also experience a reduction and increased volatility in demand for our products in connection with a global health pandemic. For example, in China, reductions and continuing volatility in that market may be caused by, among other things: store closures or modified operating hours and business model, reduced customer traffic due to illness, quarantine or government or self-imposed restrictions placed on our stores’ operations, impacts 17 Table of Contents caused by precautionary measures such as those related to face coverings and vaccinations and changes in consumer spending behaviors, including those caused by social distancing, a decrease in consumer confidence in general macroeconomic conditions and a decrease in consumer discretionary spending. Decreases in customer traffic and/or average value per transaction without a corresponding decrease in costs would put downward pressure on margins and would negatively impact our financial results. There is also a risk that if negative economic conditions or uncertainty persist for a long period of time or worsen, consumers may make long-lasting changes to their discretionary purchasing behavior, including less frequent discretionary purchases on a more permanent basis or enduring changes in behavior that precipitate a more general downturn in the restaurant industry. These and other macroeconomic factors could have an adverse effect on our sales, profitability or development plans, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition. • Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance and fluctuations in the stock market as a whole will likely adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock. Failure to meet market expectations going forward, particularly with respect to our operational and financial results, and expectations regarding the success of our Reinvention Plan and related guidance, environmental performance and shareholder returns, will likely result in a decline and/or increased volatility in the market price of our stock. In addition, price and volume fluctuations in the stock market as a whole may affect the market price of our stock in ways that may be unrelated to our financial performance. Risks Related to Human Capital • Changes in the availability of and the cost of labor could adversely affect our business. Our business could be adversely impacted by increases in labor costs, including wages and benefits, which, in a retail business such as ours, are two of our most significant costs, both domestically and internationally, including those increases triggered by state and federal legislation and regulatory actions regarding wages, scheduling and benefits; increased healthcare and workers’ compensation insurance costs; and increased wages and costs of other benefits necessary to attract and retain high-quality employees with the right skill sets. The growth of our business can make it increasingly difficult to locate and hire sufficient numbers of employees, to maintain an effective system of internal controls for a globally dispersed enterprise and to train employees worldwide to deliver a consistently high-quality product and customer experience, which could materially harm our business and results of operations. Furthermore, we have experienced, and could continue to experience, a shortage of labor for store positions, and the increased availability of alternative telecommuting employment options by other employers could decrease the pool of available qualified talent for key functions. In addition, our wages and benefits programs may be insufficient to attract and retain the best talent. Starting in September 2021, Starbucks partners at a number of company-operated stores sought union representation through elections conducted by the authorities. Unions have secured representation rights at a number of these stores, with potentially more to follow. The law places limitations on unilateral actions taken with respect to employees who are represented by unions because in certain circumstances the law requires the employer to notify and to bargain with the union prior to making certain operational or other changes that may affect employee wages, hours or other terms and conditions of employment. These limitations could negatively affect our costs, change our employee culture, and decrease our flexibility. They also present the potential to disrupt our current operational model by affecting our ability to fully implement operational changes to enhance our efficiency and adapt to changing business needs. Moreover, we have experienced job actions in some company-operated stores. Such job actions and work stoppages have the potential to negatively impact our operations, third-party providers upon whom we rely to deliver product, our sales, and our costs. Additionally, our position with respect to unions and the unionization of partners could negatively impact how our brand is perceived and have adverse effects on our business, including on our financial results. These positions could also expose us to legal risk, causing us to incur costs to defend legal and regulatory actions, potential penalties and restrictions, and reputational harm. • The loss of key personnel or difficulties recruiting and retaining qualified personnel or effectively managing changes in our workforce could adversely impact our business and financial results. Much of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel and employees. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key senior management personnel could harm our business. Our success also depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of our retail store employees upon whom we rely to give customers a superior in-store experience and elevate our brand. Accordingly, our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain high-quality management personnel and other employees to work in and manage our stores, both domestically and internationally. Our 18 Table of Contents ability to do so has been and may continue to be impacted by challenges in the labor market, which has experienced and may continue to experience wage inflation, labor shortages, increased employee turnover, changes in availability of our workforce and a shift toward remote or hybrid work arrangements. Our ability to attract and retain corporate, retail and other personnel is also acutely impacted in certain international and domestic markets where the competition for a relatively small number of qualified employees is intense or in markets where large high-tech companies are able to offer more competitive salaries and benefits. Additionally, there is intense competition for qualified technology systems developers necessary to develop and implement new technologies for our growth initiatives, including increasing our digital relationships with customers. If we are unable to recruit, retain and motivate employees sufficiently to maintain our current business and support our projected growth, our business and financial performance may be adversely affected. Risks Related to Competition • We face intense competition in each of our channels and markets, which could lead to reduced profitability. The specialty coffee market is intensely competitive, including with respect to product quality, innovation, service, convenience, such as delivery service and mobile ordering, and price, and we face significant and increasing competition in all of these areas in each of our channels and markets. Accordingly, we do not have leadership positions in all channels and markets. In the U.S., the ongoing focus by large competitors in the quick-service restaurant sector on selling high-quality specialty coffee beverages could lead to decreases in customer traffic to Starbucks® stores and/or average value per transaction adversely affecting our sales and results of operations. Similarly, continued competition from well-established competitors, or competition from large new entrants or well-funded smaller companies, in our domestic and international markets could hinder growth and adversely affect our sales and results of operations in those markets. Many small competitors also continue to open coffee specialty stores in many of our markets across the world, which in the aggregate may also lead to significant decreases of customer traffic to our stores in those markets. Increased competition globally in packaged coffee and tea and single-serve and ready-to-drink coffee beverage markets, including from new and large entrants to this market, could adversely affect the profitability of the Channel Development segment. In addition, not all of our competitors may seek to establish environmental or sustainability goals at a comparable level to ours, which could result in lower supply chain or operating costs for our competitors. We may incur increased costs associated with reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, reducing the use of plastic or imposing performance obligations on our suppliers that could increase financial obligations for us and our business partners and could affect our profitability. Additionally, if we are unable to respond to consumer demand for healthy beverages and foods, or our competitors respond more effectively, this could have a negative effect on our business. Furthermore, declines in general consumer demand for specialty coffee products for any reason, including due to consumer preference for other products, flattening demand for our products, changed customer daily routines or traffic to stores, or changed customer spending behaviors due to challenging economic conditions, could have a negative effect on our business. Risks Related to Environmental, Social and Governance Matters • Climate change may have an adverse impact on our business. We recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. For example, as we noted above, the supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, such as weather and water supply quality and availability, which factors may be caused by or exacerbated by climate change. Climate change may also result in decreased availability, less favorable pricing, or other adverse consequences for non-coffee inputs in our products. In particular, climate change may affect the availability of water in the markets in which we operate and expect to operate and elsewhere in our supply chain, which could have adverse impacts on our business. We operate in 86 markets globally. Our properties and operations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, which are predicted to increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and other natural cycles such as wildfires and droughts. Such events have the potential to disrupt our operations, cause store closures, disrupt the business of our third-party suppliers and impact our customers, all of which may cause us to suffer losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations. • Our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations and expectations, including with respect to environmental, social and governance matters, that could expose us to numerous risks. We are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self-regulatory organizations, including the SEC, the Nasdaq Stock Market and the Financial Accounting Standards Board. These rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by Congress, making compliance more difficult and uncertain. In addition, increasingly regulators, customers, investors, employees and other stakeholders are focusing on environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters and related disclosures. These changing rules, regulations and stakeholder expectations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and increased management time and attention spent complying with or 19 Table of Contents meeting such regulations and expectations. For example, developing and acting on initiatives within the scope of ESG, and collecting, measuring and reporting ESG-related information and metrics can be costly, difficult and time consuming and is subject to evolving reporting standards, including the SEC’s proposed climate-related reporting requirements, and similar proposals by other international regulatory bodies. We may also communicate certain initiatives and goals, regarding environmental matters, diversity, responsible sourcing and social investments and other ESG-related matters, in our SEC filings or in other public disclosures. These initiatives and goals within the scope of ESG could be difficult and expensive to implement, the technologies needed to implement them may not be cost effective and may not advance at a sufficient pace, and we could be criticized for the accuracy, adequacy or completeness of the disclosure. Further, statements about our ESG-related initiatives and goals, and progress toward those goals, may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future. If we are unable to meet our ESG-related goals or evolving stakeholder or industry expectations and standards, or if we are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues, customers and consumers may choose to stop purchasing our products or purchase products from another company or a competitor, and our reputation, business or financial condition may be adversely affected. If our ESG-related data, processes and reporting are incomplete or inaccurate, or if we fail to achieve progress with respect to our goals within the scope of ESG on a timely basis, or at all, our reputation, business, financial performance and growth could be adversely affected. In addition, we could be criticized by ESG detractors for the scope or nature of our ESG initiatives or goals or for any revisions to these goals. We could also be subjected to negative responses by governmental actors (such as anti-ESG legislation or retaliatory legislative treatment) or consumers (such as boycotts or negative publicity campaigns) targeting Starbucks that could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial performance and growth. Risks Related to Intellectual Property • We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property or adequately ensure that we are not infringing the intellectual property of others, which could harm the value of our brand and our business. Our brand names, trademarks and related intellectual property rights are critical assets, and our success depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets. We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products. We have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. The trademarks that we currently use have not been registered in all of the countries outside of the U.S. in which we do business or may do business in the future and may never be registered in all of these countries. It may be costly and time consuming to protect our intellectual property, and the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the U.S. and foreign countries may not be adequate. In addition, the steps we have taken may not adequately ensure that we do not infringe the intellectual property of others, and third parties may claim infringement by us in the future. Any claim of infringement, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and harm our business. In addition, we cannot ensure that licensees will not take actions that adversely affect the value of our intellectual property. Risks Related to Cybersecurity and Data Privacy • Failure to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain privacy and data protections laws and regulations may subject us to substantial negative financial consequences, reputational harm and civil or criminal penalties. Complex local, state, national, foreign and international laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal data. These privacy and data protection laws and regulations are quickly evolving, with new or modified laws and regulations proposed and implemented frequently and existing laws and regulations subject to new or different interpretations and enforcement. In addition, our legal and regulatory obligations in jurisdictions outside the U.S. are subject to unexpected changes, including the potential for regulatory or other governmental entities to enact new or additional laws or regulations, to issue rulings that invalidate prior laws or regulations or to increase penalties significantly. Complying with these laws and regulations can be costly and can impede the development and offering of new products and services. For example, Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and the U.K. General Data Protection Regulation (which implements the GDPR into U.K. law), impose stringent data protection requirements and provide for significant penalties for noncompliance. In China, the Personal Information Protection Law (“PIPL”), has established personal information processing rules, data subject rights, and obligations for personal information processors, among other things. In addition to the PIPL, China’s Data Security Law, regulates data processing activities associated with personal and non-personal data. Noncompliance with these laws may result in significant civil and criminal penalties. Other newly enacted and proposed privacy and data protection laws in other jurisdictions served by Starbucks and its licensees may impose similar requirements, including 20 Table of Contents restrictions on cross-border data transfers. Such laws may impact Starbucks business operations and increase the cost and expense of compliance. In the United States, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) requires, among other things, covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers and allows such consumers new abilities such as the right to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. The CCPA also provides for civil penalties for violations as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act, which became effective in January 2023, significantly modified the CCPA and includes additional compliance obligations. Colorado, Connecticut and Virginia recently enacted similar data privacy legislation that has also gone into effect in 2023, and a new privacy law in Utah will go into effect at the end of 2023. In addition, a number of other states have passed or are considering additional privacy laws that are expected to take effect in the near future. These laws will require us to incur additional costs and expenses in our efforts to comply. Privacy and data protection laws such as those referenced above may impact Starbucks operation and new business models, such as Starbucks Digital Solutions, which rely on Starbucks functioning as controller of customer personal information in licensed markets. As such, Starbucks may be primarily responsible for compliance with privacy and data protection laws in the markets served by participating licensees. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other obligations to which we may be subject relating to personal data, or to protect personal data from unauthorized access, use or other processing, could result in enforcement actions and regulatory investigations against us, claims for damages by customers and other affected individuals, fines and damage to our brand reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial performance and business. The amount and scope of insurance we maintain may not cover all types of claims that may arise. • The unauthorized access, use, theft or destruction of customer or employee personal, financial or other data or of Starbucks proprietary or confidential information that is stored in our information systems or by third parties on our behalf could impact our reputation and brand and expose us to potential liability and loss of revenues. Many of our information technology systems (whether cloud-based or hosted in proprietary servers), including those used for our point-of-sale, web and mobile platforms, online and mobile payment systems, delivery services and rewards programs and administrative functions, contain personal, financial or other information that is entrusted to us by our customers, business partners and employees. Many of our information technology systems also contain Starbucks proprietary and other confidential information related to our business, such as business plans and product development initiatives and designs, and confidential information about third parties, such as licensees and business partners. Similar to many other retail companies and because of the prominence of our brand, we have in the past experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, cyber-attacks, including phishing, and other attempts to breach, or gain unauthorized access to, our systems and databases. To date, these attacks have not had a material impact on our operations, but we cannot provide assurance that they will not have an impact in the future. Our third-party providers’ and business partners’ information technology systems and databases are likewise subject to such risks. The number and frequency of these attempts varies from year to year but could be exacerbated to some extent by an increase in our digital operations. In addition, we provide some customer and employee data, as well as Starbucks proprietary information and other confidential information important to our business, to third parties to conduct our business, including licensees and business partners. Individuals performing work for Starbucks and such third parties also may access some of this data, including on personally-owned digital devices. To the extent we, a third party or such an individual were to experience a breach of our or their information technology systems that results in the unauthorized access, theft, use, destruction or other compromises of customers’ or employees’ data or confidential information of the Company stored in or transmitted through such systems, including through cyber-attacks or other external or internal methods, it could result in a material loss of revenues from the potential adverse impact to our reputation and brand, a decrease in our ability to retain customers or attract new ones, the imposition of potentially significant costs (including loss of data or payment for recovery of data) and liabilities, loss of business, loss of business partners and licensees and the disruption to our supply chain, business and plans. Unauthorized access, theft, use, destruction or other compromises are becoming increasingly sophisticated and may occur through a variety of methods, including attacks using malicious code, vulnerabilities in software, hardware or other infrastructure (including systems used by our supply chain), system misconfigurations, phishing or social engineering. The rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence technologies may intensify our cybersecurity risks. Our logging capabilities, or the logging capabilities of third parties, are not always complete or sufficiently granular, affecting our ability to fully understand the scope of security breaches. Such security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable U.S. and international privacy, cyber and other laws or trigger data breach notification laws, including new disclosure rules promulgated by the SEC, and subject us to private consumer, business partner or licensee or securities litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings, any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability. These risks also exist in acquired businesses, joint ventures or companies we invest in or partner with that use separate information systems or that have not yet been fully integrated into our information systems. 21 Table of Contents Significant capital investments and other expenditures could also be required to investigate security incidents, remedy cybersecurity problems, recuperate lost data, prevent future compromises and adapt systems and practices to react to the changing threat environment. These include costs associated with notifying affected individuals and other agencies, additional security technologies, trainings, personnel, experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached. These costs, which could be material, could adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred, including by interfering with the pursuit of other important business strategies and initiatives, and may not meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to breach our information technology systems. Media or other reports of existing or perceived security vulnerabilities in our systems or those of our third-party business partners or service providers can also adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially impact our business. Additionally, the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyber-attacks and compromise information technology systems, as well as the sources and targets of these attacks, change frequently and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time. The rapid evolution and increased adoption of artificial intelligence technologies amplifies these concerns. We continue to make significant investments in technology, third-party services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyber-attacks and to prevent or minimize breaches of our information technology systems or data loss, but these security measures cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches or data loss. • We rely heavily on information technology in our operations and growth initiatives, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate and grow our business and could adversely affect our financial results. We rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations for numerous purposes including for administrative functions, point-of-sale processing and payment in our stores and online, management of our supply chain, Starbucks Cards, online business, delivery services, mobile technology, including mobile payments and ordering apps, reloads and loyalty functionality and various other processes and transactions, including providing Starbucks Digital Solutions to participating licensees, and many of these systems are interdependent on one another for their functionality. Many of our non-store employees continue to work on a remote or hybrid basis, which has resulted in increased demand on our information technology infrastructure. Additionally, the success of several of our initiatives to drive growth, including our ability to increase digital relationships with our customers to drive incremental traffic and spend, is highly dependent on our technology systems. Furthermore, we continue to expand convenience-led formats, which depend heavily on our mobile ordering capabilities. We also rely on third-party providers and platforms for some of these information technology systems and support. Additionally, our systems hardware, software and services provided by third-party service providers are not fully redundant within a market or across our markets. Our contractual and operational safeguards may not be effective in preventing the failure of these systems or platforms to operate effectively and be available. Such failures may be caused by various factors, including power outages, climate change-related impacts, catastrophic events, physical theft, computer and network failures, inadequate or ineffective redundancy, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or platforms, flaws in third-party software or services, errors or improper use by our employees or third-party service providers, or a breach in the security of these systems or platforms, including through cyber-attacks such as those that result in the blockage of our or our third-party business partners’ or service providers’ systems and platforms and those discussed in more detail in this risk factors section. If our incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective and timely manner, they could result in an interruption in our operations and could cause material negative impacts to our product availability and sales, the efficiency of our operations and our financial results. In addition, remediation of any problems with our systems and related customer support could result in significant, unplanned expenses. Risks Related to Pandemics or Epidemics • Future health epidemics or pandemics could adversely affect our business and financial results. Health epidemics or pandemics have in the past and may in the future impact macroeconomic conditions, consumer behavior, labor availability and supply chain management, as well as local operations in impacted markets, all of which can adversely affect our business, financial results and outlook. Governmental responses to health epidemics or pandemics, including operational restrictions, can also affect the foregoing items and adversely affect our business and financial results. The duration and scope of a health epidemic or pandemic can be difficult to predict and depends on many factors, including the emergence of new variants and the availability, acceptance and effectiveness of preventative measures. A health epidemic or pandemic may also heighten other risks disclosed in these risk factors, including, but not limited to, those related to the availability and costs of labor and commodities, supply chain interruptions, consumer behavior, and consumer perceptions of our brand and industry. Risks Related to Governmental and Regulatory Changes 22 Table of Contents • Failure to comply with applicable laws and changing legal and regulatory requirements could harm our business and financial results . Our policies and procedures are designed to comply with all applicable laws, accounting and reporting requirements, tax rules and other regulations and requirements, including those imposed by the SEC, Nasdaq and foreign countries, as well as applicable trade, labor, healthcare, food and beverage, sanitation, safety, environmental, labeling, anti-bribery and corruption and merchandise laws. Such laws and regulations are complex and often subject to differing interpretations, which can lead to unintentional or unknown instances of non-compliance. Changes in the enforcement priorities of regulators may also shift the impact of applicable regulations on the business and the costs necessary to ensure compliance therewith, including through an expansion in the nature, scope or complexity of matters on which we are required to report. Changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations, including increased or additional regulations and associated costs to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, to discourage the use of plastic or to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use, may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures, incremental investments and other financial obligations for us and our business partners, which could affect our profitability. In addition, our business is subject to complex and rapidly evolving U.S. and international laws and regulations regarding data privacy and data protection, and companies are under increased regulatory scrutiny relating to these matters. The Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are also interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of data. The interpretation and application of existing laws and regulations regarding data privacy and data protection are in flux and authorities around the world are considering a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals in this area. Current and future data privacy and data protection laws and regulations (including the GDPR and the CCPA, discussed in more detail in this risk factors section, and other applicable international and U.S. privacy laws), or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may limit our ability to collect and use data, require us to otherwise modify our data processing practices and policies or result in the possibility of fines, litigation or orders, which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The burdens imposed by these and other laws and regulations that may be enacted, or new interpretations of existing and future laws and regulations, may also require us to incur substantial costs in reaching compliance in a manner adverse to our business. The complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related costs of compliance are both increasing due to additional or changing legal and regulatory requirements, our ongoing expansion into new markets and new channels and the fact that foreign laws occasionally conflict with domestic laws. In addition to potential damage to our reputation and brand, failure by us or our business partners to comply with the various applicable laws and regulations, as well as changes in laws and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied, may result in litigation, civil and criminal liability, damages, fines and penalties, increased cost of regulatory compliance and restatements of our financial statements and have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.

[Reserved] 27 Table of Contents Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. All references to store counts, including data for new store openings, are reported net of related store closures, unless otherwise noted. Fiscal years 2023 and 2022 included 52 weeks. Fiscal year 2021 included 53 weeks, with the 53rd week falling in the fourth fiscal quarter. The discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ended October 3, 2021, included in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) can be found in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 2, 2022. Overview We have three reportable operating segments: 1) North America, which is inclusive of the U.S. and Canada; 2) International, which is inclusive of China, Japan, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East and Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean; and 3) Channel Development. Non-reportable operating segments and unallocated corporate expenses are reported within Corporate and Other. Our financial results and long-term growth model will continue to be driven by new store openings, comparable store sales and margin management. We believe these key operating metrics are useful to investors because management uses these metrics to assess the growth of our business and the effectiveness of our marketing and operational strategies. Throughout this MD&A, we commonly discuss the following key operating metrics: • New store openings and store count • Comparable store sales • Operating margin Starbucks results for fiscal 2023 demonstrate the overall strength of our brand. Consolidated revenues increased 12% to $36.0 billion in fiscal 2023 compared to $32.3 billion in fiscal 2022, primarily driven by strength in our U.S. business and growth in our International segment, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation. For both the North America segment and U.S. market, comparable store sales increased 9% for fiscal 2023 compared to an increase of 12% in fiscal 2022. Average ticket for both the North America segment and the U.S. market grew 6%, primarily driven by pricing in our U.S. market. The segment also experienced higher costs, primarily related to previously-committed investments in store partner wages and benefits and increased spend on partner training, as well as inflationary pressures on commodities and our supply chain. In fiscal 2022, we announced our Reinvention Plan in the U.S. market to increase efficiency while elevating the partner and customer experience. We believe the investments in partner wages and training have increased retention and in-store operational efficiencies while the acceleration of purpose-built store concepts and innovations in technologies have provided additional convenience and connection with our customers. For the International segment, despite COVID-19 pandemic-related headwinds in China in the first half of the year, revenue grew 8% in fiscal 2023 compared to fiscal 2022, primarily driven by net new company-operated store openings and higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees. Also contributing to the increase was a 5% increase in comparable store sales, driven by customer transactions, compared to a decrease of 9% in fiscal 2022. These increases were partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation. Revenue for our Channel Development segment increased 3% in fiscal 2023 compared with fiscal 2022, primarily driven by higher Global Coffee Alliance product sales and royalty revenue and growth in our global ready-to-drink business. In fiscal 2023, we sold the assets associated with the Seattle's Best Coffee brand to Nestlé, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of $91.3 million. We have seen the strength and resilience of our brand as well as strong customer demand across our portfolio, with revenue and operating margin growth in fiscal 2023. We expect to continue our trend of global new store growth in fiscal 2024, driven by a dynamic portfolio of store formats in the U.S. and leveraging the strength of our brand internationally. We anticipate continued benefits from increased sales leverage and pricing decisions as well as in-store operational efficiencies driven by our Reinvention Plan. We expect the inflationary pressures on commodities and supply chain that impacted fiscal 2023 to moderate in fiscal 2024, relative to the impact on our business and financial metrics, including operating margin. Absent global economic disruptions, and based on the current trend of our business operations and our focused efforts on the Reinvention Plan, we are confident in the strength of our brand and strategy for sustainable, profitable growth over the long-term. 28 Table of Contents Financial Highlights • Total net revenues increased 12% to $36.0 billion in fiscal 2023 compared to $32.3 billion in fiscal 2022. • Consolidated operating income increased to $5.9 billion in fiscal 2023 compared to $4.6 billion in fiscal 2022. Fiscal 2023 operating margin was 16.3% compared to 14.3% in fiscal 2022. Operating margin expansion of 200 basis points was primarily due to pricing (approximately 250 basis points), sales leverage (approximately 240 basis points) and in-store operational efficiencies (approximately 160 basis points). These increases were partially offset by previously-committed investments in store partner wages (approximately 250 basis points) and higher general and administrative expenses, primarily in support of our Reinvention Plan (approximately 130 basis points). • Diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) for fiscal 2023 increased to $3.58, compared to EPS of $2.83 in fiscal 2022. The increase was primarily driven by sales growth and in-store operational efficiencies. This increase was partially offset by previously-committed investments in store partner wages and higher general and administrative expenses, primarily in support of our Reinvention Plan. • Capital expenditures were $2.3 billion in fiscal 2023 and $1.8 billion in fiscal 2022. • We returned $3.4 billion to our shareholders in fiscal 2023 through share repurchases and dividends. We returned $6.3 billion in fiscal 2022 through share repurchases and dividends.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — FISCAL 2023 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2022 Consolidated results of operations (in millions) : Revenues Fiscal Year Ended Oct 1, 2023 Oct 2, 2022 % Change Net revenues: Company-operated stores $ 29,462.3 $ 26,576.1 10.9 % Licensed stores 4,512.7 3,655.5 23.4 Other 2,000.6 2,018.7 (0.9) Total net revenues $ 35,975.6 $ 32,250.3 11.6 % Total net revenues increased $3.7 billion, or 12%, over fiscal 2022, primarily due to higher revenues from company-operated stores ($2.9 billion). The growth in company-operated store revenue was driven by an 8% increase in comparable store sales ($2.1 billion) attributed to a 5% increase in average ticket and 3% increase in comparable transactions. Also contributing were the incremental revenues from 1,339 net new Starbucks company-operated store openings, or a 7% increase, over the past 12 months ($1.2 billion). These increases were partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation ($555 million). Licensed stores revenue increased $857 million, primarily driven by higher product and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($898 million), largely due to revenue growth from existing stores and the opening of 988 net new Starbucks licensed stores over the past 12 months, partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation ($64 million). Other revenues decreased $18 million, primarily due to the absence of revenues from the Evolution Fresh business following its sale in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 ($60 million), partially offset by an increase in revenue in the Global Coffee Alliance ($37 million). 29 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Fiscal Year Ended Oct 1, 2023 Oct 2, 2022 Oct 1, 2023 Oct 2, 2022 As a % of Total Net Revenues Product and distribution costs $ 11,409.1 $ 10,317.4 31.7 % 32.0 % Store operating expenses 14,720.3 13,561.8 40.9 42.1 Other operating expenses 539.4 461.5 1.5 1.4 Depreciation and amortization expenses 1,362.6 1,447.9 3.8 4.5 General and administrative expenses 2,441.3 2,032.0 6.8 6.3 Restructuring and impairments 21.8 46.0 0.1 0.1 Total operating expenses 30,494.5 27,866.6 84.8 86.4 Income from equity investees 298.4 234.1 0.8 0.7 Gain from sale of assets 91.3 — 0.3 — Operating income $ 5,870.8 $ 4,617.8 16.3 % 14.3 % Store operating expenses as a % of related revenues 50.0 % 51.0 % Product and distribution costs as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 30 basis points, primarily due to pricing (approximately 120 basis points), partially offset by inflationary pressures on commodities and our supply chain (approximately 80 basis points). Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 120 basis points. Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues decreased 100 basis points, primarily due to in-store operational efficiencies (approximately 160 basis points), sales leverage (approximately 160 basis points) and pricing (approximately 160 basis points). These were partially offset by previously-committed investments in store partner wages and benefits (approximately 290 basis points) and increased spend on partner training (approximately 30 basis points). Other operating expenses increased $78 million, primarily due to higher strategic investments in technology and other initiatives ($32 million) and support costs for our growing licensed markets ($25 million). Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 70 basis points, primarily due to lapping amortization expenses of acquisition-related intangibles assets that are now fully amortized. General and administrative expenses increased $409.3 million, primarily due to incremental investments in technology ($140 million), increased support costs of strategic initiatives including the Reinvention Plan ($86 million), higher performance-based compensation ($74 million) and other labor and leadership support costs ($31 million). Income from equity investees increased $64 million, primarily due to higher income from our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture ($64 million). Gain from sale of assets includes the sale of our Seattle's Best Coffee brand to Nestlé in the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The combination of these changes resulted in an overall increase in operating margin of 200 basis points in fiscal 2023 when compared to fiscal 2022. 30 Table of Contents Other Income and Expenses Fiscal Year Ended Oct 1, 2023 Oct 2, 2022 Oct 1, 2023 Oct 2, 2022 As a % of Total Net Revenues Operating income $ 5,870.8 $ 4,617.8 16.3 % 14.3 % Interest income and other, net 81.2 97.0 0.2 0.3 Interest expense (550.1) (482.9) (1.5) (1.5) Earnings before income taxes 5,401.9 4,231.9 15.0 13.1 Income tax expense 1,277.2 948.5 3.6 2.9 Net earnings including noncontrolling interests 4,124.7 3,283.4 11.5 10.2 Net earnings/(loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 0.2 1.8 0.0 0.0 Net earnings attributable to Starbucks $ 4,124.5 $ 3,281.6 11.5 % 10.2 % Effective tax rate including noncontrolling interests 23.6 % 22.4 % Interest income and other, net decreased $16 million, primarily due to lapping higher investment gains in the prior year. Interest expense increased $67 million primarily due to higher debt balances and higher interest rates. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2023 was 23.6% compared to 22.4% for fiscal 2022.The increase was due to lapping a beneficial return-to-provision adjustment related to the divestiture of certain joint venture operations (approximately 50 basis points) and a year-over-year decrease in beneficial valuation allowance activity related to international jurisdictions (approximately 40 basis points).

Also contributing to the increase were the performance of net new company-operated store openings over the past 12 months ($813 million) and higher product and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($487 million). Operating Margin North America operating income for fiscal 2023 increased 22% to $5.5 billion, compared to $4.5 billion in fiscal 2022. Operating margin expanded 150 basis points to 20.7%, primarily due to pricing (approximately 300 basis points), in-store operational efficiencies (approximately 230 basis points) and sales leverage. These were partially offset by previously-committed investments in store partner wages and benefits (approximately 300 basis points) and increased spend on partner training (approximately 40 basis points), as well as inflationary pressures on commodities and our supply chain (approximately 80 basis points). 32 Table of Contents International Fiscal Year Ended Oct 1, 2023 Oct 2, 2022 Oct 1, 2023 Oct 2, 2022 As a % of International Total Net Revenues Net revenues: Company-operated stores $ 5,556.9 $ 5,361.9 74.2 % 77.3 % Licensed stores 1,853.6 1,505.0 24.8 21.7 Other 77.1 73.2 1.0 1.1 Total net revenues 7,487.6 6,940.1 100.0 100.0 Product and distribution costs 2,608.4 2,357.7 34.8 34.0 Store operating expenses 2,761.1 2,701.8 36.9 38.9 Other operating expenses 219.0 191.4 2.9 2.8 Depreciation and amortization expenses 335.1 513.0 4.5 7.4 General and administrative expenses 335.8 345.3 4.5 5.0 Total operating expenses 6,259.4 6,109.2 83.6 88.0 Income from equity investees 2.7 2.3 0.0 0.0 Operating income $ 1,230.9 $ 833.2 16.4 % 12.0 % Store operating expenses as a % of related revenues 49.7 % 50.4 % Revenues International total net revenues for fiscal 2023 increased $548 million, or 7.9%, primarily due to 927 net new Starbucks company-operated stores, or a 12% increase over the past 12 months ($421 million), as well as higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($411 million). Also contributing to the increase was a 5% increase in comparable store sales ($233 million), primarily driven by customer transactions. These were partially offset by the impact of unfavorable foreign currency translation ($543 million). Operating Margin International operating income for fiscal 2023 increased 48% to $1.2 billion, compared to $833.2 million in fiscal 2022. Operating margin increased 440 basis points to 16.4%, primarily due to sales leverage (approximately 270 basis points) and lapping amortization expenses of acquisition-related intangibles assets that are now fully amortized (approximately 240 basis points). 33 Table of Contents Channel Development Fiscal Year Ended Oct 1, 2023 Oct 2, 2022 Oct 1, 2023 Oct 2, 2022 As a % of Channel Development Total Net Revenues Net revenues $ 1,893.8 $ 1,843.6 Product and distribution costs 1,250.1 1,194.2 66.0 % 64.8 % Other operating expenses 54.6 51.6 2.9 2.8 Depreciation and amortization expenses 0.1 0.1 0.0 0.0 General and administrative expenses 8.4 12.2 0.4 0.7 Total operating expenses 1,313.2 1,258.1 69.3 68.2 Income from equity investees 295.7 231.8 15.6 12.6 Gain from sale of assets 91.3 — 4.8 — Operating income $ 967.6 $ 817.3 51.1 % 44.3 % Revenues Channel Development total net revenues for fiscal 2023 increased $50 million, or 3%, compared to fiscal 2022, primarily due to higher Global Coffee Alliance product sales and royalty revenue ($37 million) and growth in our ready-to-drink business ($22 million). Operating Margin Channel Development operating income for fiscal 2023 increased 18% to $968 million, compared to $817 million in fiscal 2022. Operating margin increased 680 basis points to 51.1%, primarily due to the gain from sale of our Seattle's Best Coffee brand (approximately 480 basis points) and growth in our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture income (approximately 300 basis points), partially offset by impairment charges against certain manufacturing assets (approximately 100 basis points). 34 Table of Contents Corporate and Other Fiscal Year Ended Oct 1, 2023 Oct 2, 2022 % Change Net revenues: Other $ 24.6 $ 95.8 (74.3) % Total net revenues 24.6 95.8 (74.3) Product and distribution costs 20.2 88.3 (77.1) Other operating expenses 2.0 16.4 (87.8) Depreciation and amortization expenses 117.3 126.4 (7.2) General and administrative expenses 1,707.4 1,371.2 24.5 Restructuring and impairments 1.1 12.7 (91.3) Total operating expenses 1,848.0 1,615.0 14.4 Operating loss $ (1,823.4) $ (1,519.2) 20.0 % Corporate and Other primarily consists of our unallocated corporate expenses and Evolution Fresh, prior to its sale in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Unallocated corporate expenses include corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments. Corporate and Other operating loss increased to $1.8 billion for fiscal 2023, or 20%, compared to $1.5 billion in fiscal 2022. This increase was primarily driven by incremental investments in technology ($131 million), increased support costs of strategic initiatives including the Reinvention Plan ($86 million) and higher performance-based compensation ($56 million). FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash and Investment Overview Our cash and investments were $4.2 billion and $3.5 billion as of October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, respectively. We actively manage our cash and investments in order to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, fund acquisitions and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases. Our investment portfolio primarily includes highly liquid available-for-sale securities, including corporate debt securities, government treasury securities (domestic and foreign) and commercial paper as well as principal-protected structured deposits. As of October 1, 2023, approximately $2.5 billion of cash and short-term investments were held in foreign subsidiaries. Borrowing Capacity Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Revolving Credit Facility Our $3.0 billion unsecured five-year revolving credit facility (the “2021 credit facility”), of which $150.0 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit, is currently set to mature on September 16, 2026. The 2021 credit facility is available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases. We have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $1.0 billion. Borrowings under the 2021 credit facility, which was most recently amended in April 2023, will bear interest at a variable rate based on Term SOFR, and, for U.S. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the 2021 credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on the Company’s long-term credit ratings assigned by the Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s rating agencies. The “Base Rate” is the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the 2021 credit facility) plus 0.500%, (ii) Bank of America’s prime rate, and (iii) Term SOFR plus 1.000%. Term SOFR means the forward-looking SOFR term rate administrated by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange plus a SOFR Adjustment of 0.100%. The 2021 credit facility contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which measures our ability to cover financing expenses. As of October 1, 2023, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. No amounts were outstanding under our 2021 credit facility as of October 1, 2023 or October 2, 2022. 35 Table of Contents Our total contractual borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes was $3.0 billion as of the end of fiscal 2023. Commercial Paper Under our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion, with individual maturities that may vary but not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. Amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program are required to be backstopped by available commitments under our 2021 credit facility. The proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper program may be used for working capital needs, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, business expansion, payment of cash dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. As of October 1, 2023, we had no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program. As of October 2, 2022, we had $175.0 million in borrowings outstanding under this program. Credit Facilities in Japan Additionally, we hold the following Japanese yen-denominated credit facilities that are are available for working capital needs and capital expenditures within our Japanese market: • A ¥5 billion, or $33.5 million, credit facility is currently set to mature on January 4, 2024. Borrowings under this credit facility are subject to terms defined within the facility and will bear interest at a variable rate based on TIBOR plus an applicable margin of 0.400%. • A ¥10 billion, or $67.0 million, credit facility is currently set to mature on March 27, 2024. Borrowings under this credit facility are subject to terms defined within the facility and will bear interest at a variable rate based on TIBOR plus an applicable margin of 0.300%. As of October 1, 2023 we had ¥5 billion, or $33.5 million, of borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities. As of October 2, 2022, we had no borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities. See Note 9 , Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for details of the components of our long-term debt. Our ability to incur new liens and conduct sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties is subject to compliance with terms of the indentures under which the long-term notes were issued. As of October 1, 2023, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. Use of Cash We expect to use our available cash and investments, including, but not limited to, additional potential future borrowings under the credit facilities, commercial paper program and the issuance of debt to support and invest in our core businesses, including investing in new ways to serve our customers and supporting our store partners, repaying maturing debts, as well as returning cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and discretionary share repurchases and investing in new business opportunities related to our core and developing businesses. Furthermore, we may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our investees. We may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business. Acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our investees. Any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy. We believe that net future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and investments both domestically and internationally, combined with our ability to leverage our balance sheet through the issuance of debt, will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses as well as shareholder distributions for at least the next 12 months. We are currently not aware of any trends or demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in, or that are reasonably likely to result in, our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way that will impact our capital needs during or beyond the next 12 months. We have borrowed funds and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates; however, additional borrowings would result in increased interest expense in the future. In this regard, we may incur additional debt, within targeted levels, as part of our plans to fund our capital programs, including cash returns to shareholders through future dividends and discretionary share repurchases, refinancing debt maturities, as well as investing in new business opportunities. If necessary, we may pursue additional sources of financing, including both short-term and long-term borrowings and debt issuances. We regularly review our cash positions and our determination of partial indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings. In the event we determine that all or another portion of such foreign earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested, we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes, which could be material. While we do not anticipate the need for repatriated funds to the U.S. to satisfy domestic liquidity requirements, any foreign earnings which are not indefinitely reinvested may be repatriated at management’s discretion. See Note 14 , Income Taxes, for further discussion. During each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2022, we declared a cash dividend to shareholders of $0.49 per share. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, and for each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2023, we declared a cash dividend of $0.53 per 36 Table of Contents share. Dividends are generally paid in the quarter following the declaration date. Cash returned to shareholders through dividends in fiscal 2023 and 2022 totaled $2.4 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we declared a cash dividend of $0.57 per share to be paid on November 24, 2023, with an expected payout of approximately $651.2 million. During the fiscal year ended October 2, 2022, we repurchased 36.3 million shares of common stock for $4.0 billion on the open market. During the fiscal year ended October 1, 2023, we repurchased 10.0 million shares of common stock for $1.0 billion on the open market. On March 15, 2022, we announced that our Board authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 40 million shares under our ongoing share repurchase program. As of October 1, 2023, 42.6 million shares remained available for repurchase under current authorizations. Other than normal operating expenses, cash requirements for fiscal 2024 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for investments in our new and existing stores, our supply chain and corporate facilities. Total capital expenditures for fiscal 2024 are expected to be approximately $3.0 billion. The following table summarizes current and long-term material cash requirements as of October 1, 2023, which we expect to fund primarily with operating cash flows ( in millions ): Material Cash Requirements Total Less than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years More than 5 Years Operating lease obligations (1) $ 10,594.2 $ 1,577.6 $ 2,931.1 $ 2,206.9 $ 3,878.6 Debt obligations Principal payments 15,519.3 1,819.3 2,750.0 1,100.0 9,850.0 Interest payments 6,362.2 520.8 909.3 740.6 4,191.5 Purchase obligations (2) 1,078.4 694.6 311.4 72.4 — Other obligations (3) 391.4 114.4 145.6 33.4 98.0 Total $ 33,945.5 $ 4,726.7 $ 7,047.4 $ 4,153.3 $ 18,018.1 (1) Amounts include direct lease obligations, excluding any taxes, insurance and other related expenses. (2) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on Starbucks and that specify all significant terms. Green coffee purchase commitments comprise 92% of total purchase obligations. (3) Other obligations include other long-term liabilities primarily consisting of long-term income taxes payable, asset retirement obligations, equity investment capital commitments and finance lease obligations. Cash Flows Cash provided by operating activities was $6.0 billion for fiscal 2023, compared to $4.4 billion for fiscal 2022. The change was primarily due to a decrease in net cash used by changes in operating assets and liabilities, including lower inventory purchases driven by reduced coffee commodity prices, and higher net earnings during the period. Cash used in investing activities was $2.3 billion for fiscal 2023, compared to $2.1 billion for fiscal 2022. The change was primarily due to an increase in spend on capital expenditures and increased purchases of investments in fiscal 2023, partially offset by increased maturities and calls of investments in fiscal 2023. Cash used in financing activities was $3.0 billion for fiscal 2023, compared to $5.6 billion for fiscal 2022. The change was primarily due to a decrease in share repurchase activities, partially offset by an increase in net payments of commercial paper. COMMODITY PRICES, AVAILABILITY AND GENERAL RISK CONDITIONS Commodity price risk represents our primary market risk, generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products, among other items. We purchase, roast and sell high-quality arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. In addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our company-operated stores. The price and availability of these commodities directly impact our results of operations, and we expect commodity prices, particularly coffee, to impact future results of operations. For additional details see Product Supply in Item 1 , as well as Risk Factors in Item 1A of this 10-K. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT Market risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity security prices and interest rates. We manage our exposure to various market-based risks according to a market price risk management policy. Under this policy, market-based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies, such as entering into hedging transactions. The market price risk management policy governs how hedging instruments may be used to mitigate 37 Table of Contents risk. Risk limits are set annually and speculative trading activities are prohibited. We also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk, which we consider to be low. We use interest rate swap agreements and treasury locks to primarily hedge against changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances. We also use cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange debt instruments to hedge against changes in the fair value of our net investments in foreign operations. Excluding interest rate hedging instruments, cross currency swaps and foreign currency debt, hedging instruments generally do not have maturities in excess of three years. Refer to Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, and Note 3 , Derivative Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion of our hedging instruments. The sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited, point-in-time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed. The actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses. Commodity Price Risk We purchase commodity inputs, primarily coffee, dairy products, diesel, cocoa, sugar and other commodities, that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results. We use a combination of pricing features embedded within supply contracts, such as fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed contracts and financial derivatives to manage our commodity price risk exposure. The following table summarizes the potential impact as of October 1, 2023 to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income (“OCI”) from changes in commodity prices. The information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items (in millions) : Increase/(Decrease) to Net Earnings Increase/(Decrease) to OCI 10% Increase in Underlying Rate 10% Decrease in Underlying Rate 10% Increase in Underlying Rate 10% Decrease in Underlying Rate Commodity hedges $ 1.2 $ (1.2) $ 33 $ (33) Foreign Currency Exchange Risk The majority of our revenue, expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the U.S., we have transactions in other currencies, primarily the Chinese renminbi, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, British pound, South Korean won and euro. To reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations, we enter into derivative instruments to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated intercompany royalty payments, inventory purchases, intercompany borrowing and lending activities and certain other transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity that enters into the arrangements, as well as the translation risk of certain balance sheet items. The volatility in the foreign exchange market may lead to significant fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates and adversely impact our financial results in the case of weakening foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The following table summarizes the potential impact as of October 1, 2023 to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due to a change in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign exchange rates. The information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items ( in millions ): Increase/(Decrease) to Net Earnings Increase/(Decrease) to OCI 10% Increase in Underlying Rate 10% Decrease in Underlying Rate 10% Increase in Underlying Rate 10% Decrease in Underlying Rate Foreign currency hedges $ 27 $ (27) $ 197 $ (197) Equity Security Price Risk We have minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds and equity exchange-traded funds within our marketable equity securities portfolio. Marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value and approximates a portion of our liability under our Management Deferred Compensation Plan (“MDCP”). Gains and losses from the portfolio and the change in our MDCP liability are recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings. We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of October 1, 2023 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments. 38 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk Long-term Debt We utilize short-term and long-term financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage our overall interest expense related to our existing fixed-rate debt, as well as to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances. See Note 3 , Derivative Financial Instruments and Note 9 , Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion of our interest rate hedge agreements and details of the components of our long-term debt, respectively, as of October 1, 2023. The following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates as of October 1, 2023 on the fair value of Starbucks debt (in millions) : Fair Value Decrease in Fair Value for a 100 Basis Point Increase in Underlying Rate Long-term debt (1)(2) $ 13,426 $ (820) (1) Amount disclosed is net of $16 million change in the fair value of our designated interest rate swaps. Refer to Note 3 , Derivative Financial Instruments, for additional information on our interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge. (2) Includes $750 million in Senior Notes that matured on October 1, 2023 but remained in current portion of long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheet as the debt repayment was not made until the first day of fiscal 2024. Available-for-Sale Debt Securities Our available-for-sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of investment-grade debt securities. The primary objective of these investments is to preserve capital and liquidity. Available-for-sale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. We do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our investments. We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our available-for-sale securities as of October 1, 2023 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Critical accounting estimates are those that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Our significant accounting estimates are discussed in additional detail in Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. We consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. During the past five fiscal years, we have not made any material changes to the accounting methodologies used to assess the areas discussed below, unless noted otherwise. We believe that our significant accounting estimates involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity for the reasons discussed below: Income Taxes We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. We routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and results of operations. In projecting future taxable income, we consider historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal and foreign pre-tax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. Our assumptions regarding future taxable income are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income/(loss). 39 Table of Contents In addition, our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include review of our tax filing positions, such as the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions. We evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of our position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. For uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold, we record a related liability. We adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available. As discussed in Note 14 , Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, there is a reasonable possibility that our unrecognized tax benefit liability will be adjusted within 12 months due to the expiration of a statute of limitations and/or resolution of examinations with taxing authorities. We have generated income in certain foreign jurisdictions that may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes. We regularly review our plans for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings. The possibility exists that foreign earnings declared as indefinitely reinvested may be repatriated as our plans are based on our estimated working and other capital needs in jurisdictions where our earnings are generated. While we do not expect to repatriate cash to the U.S. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs, if these amounts were distributed to the U.S., in the form of dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes, which could be material. Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. Deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation, the status of various income tax audits and our particular facts and circumstances. Although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results, including forecasted business performance, could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. Property, Plant and Equipment and Other Finite-Lived Assets We evaluate property, plant and equipment, operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and other finite-lived assets for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. When evaluating for impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis and is depreciated over the asset's remaining useful life. Long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For company-operated store assets, the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level, which is inclusive of property, plant and equipment and lease ROU assets. The fair value of a store’s assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. For other long-lived assets, fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances, which may include discounted cash flows, comparable transactions or comparable company analyses. Our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values. Key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values include projected revenue growth and operating expenses, as well as forecasting asset useful lives and selecting an appropriate discount rate. For company-operated stores, estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider the store’s historical performance, the local market economics and the business environment impacting the store’s performance. The discount rate is selected based on what we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store. The fair value of a store’s ROU asset is estimated considering what a market participant would pay to lease the asset for its highest and best use. These estimates are subjective and our ability to realize future cash flows and asset fair values is affected by factors such as ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets, changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance. 40 Table of Contents In fiscal 2022, we announced our Reinvention Plan in the U.S. market to increase efficiency while elevating the partner and customer experience. As a result of the restructuring efforts in connection with the Reinvention Plan, we recorded immaterial impairment charges on our consolidated statements of earnings during the fiscal years ended October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022. Future impairment charges attributed to our Reinvention Plan are not expected to be material. Asset impairment charges are discussed in Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets We evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate impairment may exist. When evaluating these assets for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit using discounted cash flows or a combination of discounted cash flow and market approaches. When assessing goodwill for impairment, our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment for an individual reporting unit is influenced by a number of factors, inclusive of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill, the significance of the excess of the reporting unit’s estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date, the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments and the date of acquisition. If we perform a quantitative assessment of an individual reporting unit’s goodwill, our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment when estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, including projected revenue growth and operating expenses related to existing businesses, product innovation and new store concepts, as well as utilizing valuation multiples of similar publicly traded companies and selecting an appropriate discount rate. Estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering the reporting unit’s past performance and forecasted growth, strategic initiatives, local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit’s performance. The discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital for a market participant to operate the reporting unit in the region. These estimates, as well as the selection of comparable companies and valuation multiples used in the market approaches are highly subjective, and our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion. We continue to believe the fair value of each of our reporting units is significantly in excess of its carrying value, and absent a sustained multi-year global decline in our business in key markets such as the U.S. and China, we do not anticipate incurring significant goodwill impairment in the next 12 months. Our fiscal 2023 annual goodwill impairment testing was completed in the third fiscal quarter. Where a quantitative assessment was performed, the estimated fair value of our reporting units exceeded carrying value by approximately $101 billion. When assessing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, where we perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate if changes in events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that impairment may exist. If we do not perform a qualitative impairment assessment or if changes in events and circumstances indicate that a quantitative assessment should be performed, management is required to calculate the fair value of the intangible asset group. The fair value calculation includes estimates of revenue growth, which are based on past performance and internal projections for the intangible asset group’s forecasted growth, and royalty rates, which are adjusted for our particular facts and circumstances. The discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital that reflects the risk profile of the related business. These estimates are highly subjective, and our ability to achieve the forecasted cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion. We do not anticipate recording significant impairment charges in the next 12 months.

Fiscal Years ended October 1, 2023, October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021 Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates Description of Business We purchase and roast high-quality coffees that we sell, along with handcrafted coffee and tea beverages and a variety of fresh and prepared food items, through our company-operated stores. We also sell a variety of coffee and tea products and license our trademarks through other channels such as licensed stores, grocery and foodservice. The grocery and foodservice business is primarily through our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestlé established in August 2018. In this 10-K, Starbucks Corporation (together with its subsidiaries) is referred to as “Starbucks,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our.” Segment information is prepared on the same basis that our management reviews financial information for operational decision-making purposes. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, certain changes were made to our management team, and our operating segment reporting structure was realigned as a result. We realigned our fully licensed Latin America and Caribbean markets from our Americas operating segment to our International operating segment. We renamed the Americas operating segment to the North America operating segment, since it is comprised of our company-operated and licensed stores in the U.S. and Canada. We also made certain other immaterial changes between our International operating segment and Corporate and Other. There was no impact on consolidated net revenues, total operating expenses, operating income or net earnings per share as a result of these changes. We have three reportable operating segments: 1) North America, which is inclusive of the U.S. and Canada; 2) International, which is inclusive of China, Japan, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East and Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean; and 3) Channel Development. Non-reportable operating segments and unallocated corporate expenses are reported within Corporate and Other. Additional details on the nature of our business and our reportable operating segments are included in Note 17 , Segment Reporting. Certain prior period information on the consolidated statements of cash flows have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Principles of Consolidation Our consolidated financial statements reflect the financial position and operating results of Starbucks, including wholly-owned subsidiaries and investees that we control. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Fiscal Year End Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. Fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021 included 52, 52 and 53 weeks, respectively. The 53rd week in fiscal 2021 fell in the fourth fiscal quarter. Estimates and Assumptions Preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Examples include, but are not limited to, estimates for inventory reserves, asset and goodwill impairments, assumptions underlying self-insurance reserves, income from unredeemed stored value cards, stock-based compensation forfeiture rates, future asset retirement obligations, commitments and contingencies, and the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements. Actual results and outcomes may differ from these estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties, including uncertainty in the current economic environment. Restructuring In fiscal 2022, we announced our plan in the U.S. market to increase efficiency while elevating the partner and customer experience (the “Reinvention Plan”). We believe the company-operated market investments in partner wages and trainings have increased retention and productivity while the acceleration of purpose-built store concepts and innovations in technologies have provided additional convenience and connection with our customers. As a result of the restructuring efforts in connection with the Reinvention Plan, we recorded approximately $ 22 million and $ 46 million to restructuring and impairments on our consolidated statements of earnings during fiscal years 2023 and 2022, respectively. Future restructuring and impairment costs attributable to our Reinvention Plan are not expected to be material. 48 Table of Contents In fiscal 2021, we substantially completed our plan to reposition our North America store portfolio, primarily in dense metropolitan markets by pursuing strategic store closures and focusing on new store formats that better cater to changing customer tastes and preferences. During fiscal 2021, we recorded approximately $ 155.4 million to restructuring and impairments on our consolidated statements of earnings. This total included $ 53.1 million related to disposal and impairment of company-operated store assets and $ 89.5 million primarily associated with accelerated amortization of ROU lease assets and other lease costs due to store closures prior to the end of contractual lease terms. As this restructuring plan was substantially completed in fiscal 2021, we did not recognize any material restructuring and impairment amounts related to this plan during the fiscal years ended October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022. As of October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, there were no material restructuring-related accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Cash and Cash Equivalents We consider all highly liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase, as well as credit card receivables for sales to customers in our company-operated stores that generally settle within two to five business days, to be cash equivalents. We maintain cash and cash equivalent balances with financial institutions that exceed federally-insured limits. We have not experienced any losses related to these balances, and we believe credit risk to be minimal. Our cash management system provides for the funding of all major bank disbursement accounts on a daily basis as checks are presented for payment. Under this system, outstanding checks are in excess of the cash balances at certain banks, which creates book overdrafts. Book overdrafts are presented as a current liability in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Investments Available-for-sale Debt Securities Our short-term and long-term investments include investment-grade debt securities, all of which are classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair value, and unrealized holding gains and losses are recorded, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Available-for-sale securities with remaining maturities of less than one year and those identified by management at the time of purchase to be used to fund operations within one year are classified as short-term. All other available-for-sale securities are classified as long-term. We evaluate our available-for-sale securities for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. Unrealized losses are charged against net earnings when a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary. We review several factors to determine whether a loss is other than temporary, such as the length and extent of the fair value decline, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and whether we have the intent to sell or will more likely than not be required to sell before the securities' anticipated recovery, which may be at maturity. Realized gains and losses are accounted for using the specific identification method. Purchases and sales are recorded on a trade date basis. Structured Deposits We hold short-term, principal-protected structured deposits that provide returns in the form of both fixed and variable yields; such variable yields are indexed to foreign exchange rates, equity-linked instruments or interest rate indices. The Company has elected to account for these using the fair value option with gains and losses recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings. For fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, resulting gains and losses were immaterial to our consolidated statements of earnings. Marketable Equity Securities We also have a marketable equity securities portfolio, which is comprised of marketable equity mutual funds and equity exchange-traded funds. Marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value and approximates a portion of our liability under our Management Deferred Compensation Plan (“MDCP”). Gains or losses from the portfolio and the change in our MDCP liability are recorded in general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of earnings. Refer to Note 4 , Fair Value Measurements, for further discussion of our MDCP liability. Equity Investments Equity investments are accounted for under the equity method if we are able to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. Our share of the earnings or losses as reported by the investees is classified as income from equity investees on our consolidated statements of earnings. The investments are evaluated for impairment annually and when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. We account for equity investments for which we do not have significant influence and without readily determinable fair values at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments as permitted by the measurement alternative. Investments for which the measurement alternative has been elected are assessed for impairment quarterly, or if a triggering 49 Table of Contents event indicates impairment may be present. Any adjustments as a result of price changes or impairments are recorded in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. Fair Value Fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability (exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants. For assets and liabilities recorded or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis, we determine fair value based on the following: Level 1: The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. For equity and U.S. government treasury securities and commodity futures contracts, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets to determine fair value. Level 2: When quoted prices in active markets for identical assets are not available, we determine the fair value of certain assets based upon factors such as the quoted market price of similar assets or a discounted cash flow model using readily observable market data, which may include interest rate curves and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities, depending on the nature of the investment. The fair value of our long-term debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates offered to us for debt of the same remaining maturities. Level 3: We determine the fair value of our auction rate securities using an internally-developed valuation model, using inputs that include interest rate curves, credit and liquidity spreads and effective maturity. Assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis may include items such as property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, equity and other investments and other assets. We determine the fair value of these items using Level 3 inputs, as described in the related sections below. Derivative Instruments We manage our exposure to various risks within our consolidated financial statements according to a market price risk management policy. Under this policy, we may engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments to hedge interest rates, commodity prices and foreign currency-denominated revenue streams, inventory purchases, assets and liabilities and investments in certain foreign operations. In order to manage our exposure to these risks, we use various types of derivative instruments including forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, collars and swaps. Forward contracts and commodity futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a predetermined future date and at a predetermined rate or price. A collar is a strategy that uses a combination of a purchased call option and a sold put option with equal premiums to hedge a portion of anticipated cash flows, or to limit possible gains or losses on an underlying asset or liability to a specific range. A swap agreement is a contract between two parties to exchange cash flows based on specified underlying notional amounts, assets and/or indices. We do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes. We record all derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value and typically do not offset derivative assets and liabilities. Cash flows from derivative financial instruments and the related gains and losses are classified as cash flows from operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. Excluding interest rate hedging instruments, cross-currency swaps and foreign currency debt hedging instruments, we generally do not enter into derivative instruments with maturities longer than three years. However, we are allowed to net settle transactions with respective counterparties for certain derivative contracts, inclusive of interest rate swaps and foreign currency forwards, with a single, net amount payable by one party to the other. We also enter into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. As of October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, cash collateral held under collateral security arrangements was $ 77.1 million and $ 74.3 million, respectively, and is included in other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. As of October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, cash collateral pledged as part of our commodity derivative margin requirements was $ 20.6 million and $ 75.6 million, respectively, and is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets. The potential effects of netting arrangements with our derivative contracts, excluding the effects of collateral, would not have had a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets. By using these derivative instruments, we expose ourselves to potential credit risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. We minimize this credit risk by entering into transactions with carefully selected, credit-worthy counterparties and distribute contracts among several financial institutions to reduce the concentration of credit risk. Cash Flow Hedges For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the derivative's gain or loss is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) on our consolidated balance sheets. The gain or loss is subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged exposure affects net earnings, in the same line item as the underlying hedged item on our consolidated statements of earnings. 50 Table of Contents Cash flow hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the inception of each hedge. Cash flows from hedging transactions are classified in the same categories as the cash flows from the respective hedged items. For de-designated cash flow hedges in which the transactions are no longer likely to occur, the related accumulated derivative gains or losses are recognized in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. Net Investment Hedges For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a net investment hedge, the derivative's, or qualifying non-derivative instrument’s gain or loss is reported as a component of OCI and recorded in AOCI. The gain or loss will be subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. Fair Value Hedges For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the changes in fair value of the derivative instrument and the offsetting changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item due to changes in the hedged risk are recorded in interest income and other, net or interest expense on our consolidated statements of earnings. Derivatives Not Designated As Hedging Instruments We also enter into certain foreign currency forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, collars and swaps that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. The changes in the fair values of these contracts are immediately recognized in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. Normal Purchase Normal Sale We enter into fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed green coffee purchase commitments, which we expect to take delivery and to utilize in a reasonable period of time in the ordinary course of business. Since these types of purchase commitments qualify for the normal purchase normal sale exemption, they are not recorded as derivative instruments on our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 3 , Derivative Financial Instruments, and Note 5 , Inventories, for further discussion of our derivative instruments and green coffee purchase commitments. Receivables, net of Allowance for Credit Losses Our receivables are mainly generated from product and equipment sales to and royalties from our licensees, as well as from our Global Coffee Alliance and other Channel Development customers. The primary indicators of the credit quality of our receivables are aging, payment history, economic sector information and outside credit monitoring, and are assessed on a quarterly basis. Our credit loss exposure is mainly concentrated in our accounts receivable portfolio. Our allowance for credit losses is calculated using a loss-rate method based on historical experience, current market conditions and reasonable forecasts. For the fiscal year ended October 1, 2023, we did not observe a significant deterioration of our receivable portfolio that required a significant increase in our allowance for credit losses. As of October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, our allowance for credit losses was $ 23.8 million and $ 27.2 million, respectively. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (primarily moving average cost) or net realizable value. We record inventory reserves for obsolete and slow-moving inventory and for estimated shrinkage between physical inventory counts. Inventory reserves are based on inventory obsolescence trends, historical experience and application of the specific identification method. As of October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, inventory reserves were $ 44.4 million and $ 43.1 million, respectively. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes all direct costs necessary to acquire and prepare assets for use, including internal labor and overhead in some cases. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of the assets, generally ranging from 2 to 15 years for equipment and 30 to 40 years for buildings. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the related lease life, generally 10 years. For leases with renewal periods at our option, we generally use the original lease term, excluding renewal option periods, to determine estimated useful lives. If failure to exercise a renewal option imposes a significant economic penalty to us, we may determine at the inception of the lease that renewal is reasonably assured and include the renewal option period in the determination of the appropriate estimated useful lives. The portion of depreciation expense related to production and distribution facilities is included in product and distribution costs on our consolidated statements of earnings. The costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed when incurred, while expenditures for refurbishments and improvements that significantly add to the productive capacity or extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized. When assets are disposed of, whether through retirement or sale, the net gain or loss is recognized in net earnings. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell. 51 Table of Contents We evaluate property, plant and equipment for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. When evaluating for impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The fair value of the asset is estimated using a discounted cash flow model based on forecasted future revenues and operating costs, using internal projections. Property, plant and equipment assets and ROU assets related to the store lease are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For company-operated store assets, the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level. We recognized net disposition and impairment charges of $ 91.1 million, $ 66.6 million and $ 153.1 million in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We recorded $ 23.2 million, $ 14.3 million and $ 44.4 million of impairment losses within store operating expenses on our consolidated statements of earnings during the fiscal years ended October 1, 2023, October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021, respectively. Of the total net disposition and impairment charges recorded in fiscal 2022 and 2021, $ 9.6 million and $ 53.1 million, respectively, were restructuring related and recorded in restructuring and impairment expenses. Unless it is restructuring related, the nature of the underlying asset that is impaired or disposed of will determine the operating expense line on which the related impact is recorded on our consolidated statements of earnings. Leases The majority of our leases are operating leases for our company-operated retail store locations. We also lease, among other things, roasting, distribution and warehouse facilities and office space for corporate administrative purposes. We categorize leases as either operating or finance leases at the commencement date of the lease. Operating lease agreements may contain tenant improvement allowances, rent holidays, rent escalation clauses and/or contingent rent provisions. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for together as a single lease component for all underlying classes of assets. We recognize a ROU asset and lease liability for each operating and finance lease with a contractual term greater than 12 months at the time of lease inception. We do not record leases with an initial term of 12 months or less on our consolidated balance sheet but continue to record rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We review contracts for identified assets where we have the right to direct the use of the asset and record those agreements as embedded leases on our consolidated balance sheet. Our leases often include options to extend or terminate at our sole discretion, which are included in the determination of lease term when they are reasonably certain to be exercised. Our lease liability represents the present value of future lease payments over the lease term. Given our policy election to combine lease and non-lease components, we also consider fixed common area maintenance (“CAM”) part of our fixed future lease payments; therefore, fixed CAM is also included in our lease liability. We generally cannot determine the interest rate implicit in each of our leases. Therefore, we typically use market and term-specific incremental borrowing rates. Our incremental borrowing rate for a lease is the rate of interest we expect to pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments under similar terms. Because we do not borrow on a collateralized basis, we consider a combination of factors, including our credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate, the risk profile and funding cost of the specific geographic market of the lease, the lease term and the effect of adjusting the rate to reflect consideration of collateral. Our credit-adjusted risk-free rate takes into consideration interest rates we pay on our unsecured long-term bonds as well as quoted interest rates obtained from financial institutions. Total lease costs recorded as rent and other occupancy costs include fixed operating lease costs, variable lease costs and short-term lease costs. Most of our real estate leases require we pay certain expenses, such as CAM costs, real estate taxes and other executory costs, of which the fixed portion is included in operating lease costs. We recognize operating lease costs on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In addition to the above costs, variable lease costs also include amounts based on a percentage of gross sales in excess of specified levels and are recognized when probable and are not included in determining the present value of our lease liability. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. A significant majority of our leases are related to our company-operated stores, and their related costs are recorded within store operating expenses. The ROU asset is measured at the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, initial direct costs and any tenant improvement allowances received. For operating leases, ROU assets are reduced over the lease term by the recognized straight-line lease expense less the amount of accretion of the lease liability determined using the effective interest method. For finance leases, ROU assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the leased asset or the lease term. Interest expense on each finance lease liability is recognized utilizing the effective interest method. ROU assets are tested for impairment in the same manner as long-lived assets. 52 Table of Contents Additionally, we monitor for events or changes in circumstances that may require a reassessment of one of our leases and determine if a remeasurement is required. See Note 10 , Leases, for additional details. For the fiscal year ended October 3, 2021, we recognized accelerated amortization of ROU lease assets and other lease costs of $ 89.5 million, due to planned store closures prior to the end of contractual lease terms, which were recorded in restructuring and impairments on the consolidated statement of earnings. In fiscal 2021, we substantially completed our plan to optimize our North America store portfolio, and we did not recognize any material restructuring and impairment amounts related to this plan during fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022. Goodwill We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change, such as material deterioration in performance or a significant number of store closures, that would indicate that impairment may exist. When evaluating goodwill for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. Fair value is typically calculated using a discounted cash flow model. For certain reporting units, where deemed appropriate, we may also utilize a market approach for estimating fair value. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value. As part of our ongoing operations, we may close certain stores within a reporting unit containing goodwill due to underperformance of the store or inability to renew our lease, among other reasons. We may abandon certain assets associated with a closed store, including leasehold improvements and other non-transferable assets. When a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business is to be disposed of, goodwill associated with the business is included in the carrying amount of the business in determining any loss on disposal. Our evaluation of whether the portion of a reporting unit being disposed of constitutes a business occurs on the date of abandonment. Although an operating store meets the accounting definition of a business prior to abandonment, it does not constitute a business on the closure date because the remaining assets on that date do not constitute an integrated set of activities (substantive processes) and assets that are capable of being managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. As a result, when closing individual stores, we do not include goodwill in the calculation of any loss on disposal of the related assets. We recorded no goodwill impairment during fiscal 2023, fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021. See Note 8 , Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill, for further information. Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets include finite-lived intangible assets, which mainly consist of acquired and reacquired rights, trade secrets, licensing agreements, contract-based patents and copyrights. These assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment using a similar methodology to our property, plant and equipment, as described above. Indefinite-lived intangibles, which consist primarily of trade names and trademarks, are tested for impairment annually during the third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that impairment may exist. When evaluating other intangible assets for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an intangible asset group is impaired. If we do not perform the qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset group exceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset group. Fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the intangible asset group and is typically calculated using an income approach, such as a relief-from-royalty model. If the carrying amount of the intangible asset group exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value. In addition, we continuously monitor and may revise our intangible asset useful lives if and when facts and circumstances change. There were no significant other intangible asset impairment charges recorded during fiscal years 2023, 2022 and 2021. See Note 8 , Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill, for further information. Insurance Reserves We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance treaty, to provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks, including workers’ compensation, healthcare benefits, general liability, property insurance and director and officers’ liability insurance. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by us are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographics, exposure and severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Revenue Recognition Consolidated revenues are presented net of intercompany eliminations for wholly-owned subsidiaries and investees controlled by us and for product sales to and royalty and other fees from licensees accounted for under the equity method. Additionally, 53 Table of Contents consolidated revenues are recognized net of any discounts, returns, allowances and sales incentives, including coupon redemptions and rebates. Company-operated Store Revenues Company-operated store revenues are recognized when payment is tendered at the point-of-sale as the performance obligation has been satisfied. For products sold via delivery platforms, contractual terms are evaluated for each service provider to determine gross versus net presentation and revenues are also recognized when control of products are transferred to the customers. Delivery service fees were immaterial in the periods presented. Company-operated store revenues are reported excluding sales, use or other transaction taxes that are collected from customers and remitted to taxing authorities. Licensed Store Revenues Licensed store revenues consist of product and equipment sales, royalties and other fees paid by licensees using the Starbucks brand. Sales of coffee, tea, food and related products are generally recognized upon shipment to licensees, depending on contract terms. Shipping charges billed to licensees are also recognized as revenue, and the related shipping costs are included in product and distribution costs on our consolidated statements of earnings. We consider pre-opening services, including site evaluation and selection, store architectural/design and development and operational training, to be performance obligations that are separate from the license to operate under the Starbucks brand. These services provide distinct value to our licensees, including business and industry insight and knowledge that transfers value apart from the license. Revenues associated with pre-opening services are recognized upon completion of the related performance obligations, generally when a store is opened. Royalty revenues are recognized based upon a percentage of reported sales, and other continuing fees, such as marketing and service fees, are recognized as the performance obligations are met. Stored Value Cards Stored value cards can be activated through various channels, including at our company-operated and most licensed store locations, online at Starbucks.com or via mobile devices held by our customers and at certain other third-party websites and locations, such as grocery stores, although they cannot be reloaded at these third-party websites or locations. Amounts loaded onto stored value cards are initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue upon redemption. Historically, the majority of stored value cards are redeemed within one year. In many of our company-owned markets, including the U.S., our stored value cards do not have an expiration date nor do we charge service fees that cause a decrement to customer balances. Based on historical redemption rates, a portion of stored value cards is not expected to be redeemed and will be recognized as breakage over time in proportion to stored value card redemptions. The redemption rates are based on historical redemption patterns for each market, including the timing and business channel in which the card was activated or reloaded, and remittance to government agencies under unclaimed property laws, if applicable. Breakage is recognized as company-operated stores and licensed stores revenue within the consolidated statement of earnings. For the fiscal years ended October 1, 2023, October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021, we recognized breakage revenue of $ 196.1 million, $ 196.0 million and $ 164.5 million in company-operated store revenues, respectively, and $ 18.9 million, $ 16.7 million and $ 16.6 million in licensed store revenues, respectively. Loyalty Program Customers in the U.S., Canada and certain other countries who register their Starbucks Card are automatically enrolled in the Starbucks Rewards program, which is primarily a spend-based loyalty program. They earn loyalty points (“Stars”) in a variety of ways, including with each purchase at participating Starbucks stores. Starbucks Rewards members can earn Stars by paying with cash, credit or debit cards, or selected mobile wallets at company-operated and certain participating licensed stores in the U.S. and Canada. After accumulating a certain number of Stars, the customer earns a reward that can be redeemed for free product that, regardless of where the related Stars were earned within that country, will be honored at company-operated stores and certain participating licensed store locations in that same country. We defer revenue associated with the estimated selling price of Stars earned by Starbucks Rewards members towards free products as each Star is earned and a corresponding liability is established in deferred revenue. This deferral is based on the estimated value of the product for which the reward is expected to be redeemed, net of estimated unredeemed Stars. Stars generally expire after six months. When a customer redeems an earned reward, we recognize revenue for the redeemed product and reduce the related deferred revenue. 54 Table of Contents Other Revenues Other revenues primarily include royalty revenues, sales of packaged coffee, tea and a variety of ready-to-drink beverages and single-serve coffee and tea products to customers outside of our company-operated and licensed stores. Sales of these products are generally recognized upon shipment to customers, depending on contract terms. Other revenues also include product sales to and licensing revenue from Nestlé related to our Global Coffee Alliance. Product sales to Nestlé are generally recognized when the product is shipped whereas royalty revenues are recognized based on a percentage of reported sales. Deferred Revenues Our deferred revenue primarily consists of the up-front prepaid royalty from Nestlé, for which we have continuing performance obligations to support the Global Coffee Alliance, and our unredeemed stored value card liability and unredeemed Stars associated with our loyalty program. See Note 11 , Deferred Revenue, for further information. Disaggregation of Revenues Revenues disaggregated by segment, product type and geographic area are disclosed in Note 17 , Segment Reporting. Product and Distribution Costs Product and distribution costs primarily consist of raw materials, purchased goods, packaging costs and delivery-related expenses as well as operational costs of our supply chain organization, such as wages and benefits, occupancy costs and depreciation expenses, in support of sourcing, procuring, manufacturing, warehousing and transportation activities of products sold at our company-operated and licensed stores as well as through Channel Development and our other businesses. Also included are inventory and supply chain asset impairment costs. Store Operating Expenses Store operating expenses consist of costs incurred in our company-operated stores, primarily wages and benefits related to store partners (employees), occupancy costs, delivery commissions and other costs that directly support the operation and sales-related activities of those stores. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses primarily consist of wages and benefits, professional service fees and occupancy costs for corporate headquarters and regional offices that support our corporate functions, including technology, finance, legal and partner resources . Advertising We expense most advertising costs as they are incurred, except for certain production costs that are expensed the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expenses totaled $ 507.8 million, $ 416.7 million and $ 305.1 million in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Government Subsidies On March 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”), which among other things, provided employer payroll tax credits for wages paid to employees who are unable to work during the COVID-19 pandemic and options to defer payroll tax payments for a limited period. Based on our evaluation of the CARES Act, we qualified for certain employer payroll tax credits as well as the deferral of payroll tax payments in the future. Additionally, the Canadian government enacted the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (“CEWS”) to help employers offset a portion of their employee wages for a limited period. We elected to treat qualified government subsidies from the U.S., Canada and other governments as offsets to the related operating expenses. The CARES Act and CEWS were no longer applicable to us in late fiscal 2021. The qualified payroll credits reduced our store operating expenses by $ 210.0 million on our consolidated statement of earnings during fiscal 2021. After netting the qualified credits against our payable, a receivable balance of $ 15.6 million and $ 69.4 million was included in prepaid expenses and other current assets as of October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, respectively. As of October 1, 2023, the deferred payroll tax payments have been remitted in full. As of October 2, 2022, deferred payroll tax payments of $ 116.5 million were included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Store Preopening Expenses Costs incurred in connection with the start-up and promotion of new company-operated store openings are expensed as incurred. Asset Retirement Obligations 55 Table of Contents We recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations (“ARO”) when such obligations are incurred. Our AROs are primarily associated with leasehold improvements, which, at the end of a lease, we are contractually obligated to remove in order to comply with the lease agreement. At the inception of a lease with such conditions, we record an ARO liability and a corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation. We estimate the liability using a number of assumptions, including store closing costs, cost inflation rates and discount rates, and accrete the liability to its projected future value over time. The capitalized asset is depreciated using the same depreciation convention as leasehold improvement assets. Upon satisfaction of the ARO conditions, any difference between the recorded ARO liability and the actual retirement costs incurred is recognized as a gain or loss in store operating expenses on our consolidated statements of earnings. As of October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, our net ARO assets included in property, plant and equipment were $ 25.6 million and $ 26.1 million, respectively, and our net ARO liabilities included in other long-term liabilities were $ 110.3 million and $ 104.7 million, respectively. Stock-based Compensation We maintain several equity incentive plans under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) or stock appreciation rights to employees, non-employee directors and consultants; stock options have not been broadly used as part of our compensation strategy in recent years. We also have an employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”). RSUs issued by us are equivalent to nonvested shares under the applicable accounting guidance. We record stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of stock awards at the grant date and recognize the expense over the related service period following a graded vesting expense schedule. Expense for performance-based RSUs is recognized when it is probable the performance goal will be achieved. Performance goals are determined by the Board and may include measures such as earnings per share, operating income, return on invested capital, total shareholder return and metrics focused on building inclusive and diverse teams. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model. The assumptions used to calculate the fair value of options granted are evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect market conditions and our historical experience. The fair value of RSUs is based on the closing price of Starbucks common stock on the award date, less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. If applicable, our total shareholder return relative to our peer group is incorporated into the underlying assumptions using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model to calculate grant date fair value. Compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award, and only for those awards expected to vest, with forfeitures estimated at the date of grant based on our historical experience and future expectations. Foreign Currency Translation Our international operations generally use their local currency as their functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Income and expense accounts are translated at the average monthly exchange rates during the year. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of OCI and recorded in AOCI on our consolidated balance sheets. Income Taxes We compute income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred income taxes are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred taxes is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdictions from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and results of recent operations. If we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes. In addition, our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include review of our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions. We evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of our position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. For uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold, we record a related liability. We adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the 56 Table of Contents period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available. Starbucks recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense on our consolidated statements of earnings. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax balances on our consolidated balance sheets. Global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) provisions are applied, providing an incremental tax on foreign income. We have made a policy election to classify taxes due under the GILTI provision as a current period expense. Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock and the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period, calculated using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and RSUs. Performance-based RSUs are considered dilutive when the related performance criterion has been met. Common Stock Share Repurchases We may repurchase shares of Starbucks common stock under a program authorized by our Board, including pursuant to a contract, instruction or written plan meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the Exchange Act. Under applicable Washington State law, shares repurchased are retired and not displayed separately as treasury stock on the financial statements. Instead, the par value of repurchased shares is deducted from common stock and the excess repurchase price over par value is deducted from additional paid-in capital and from retained earnings (deficit). Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued guidance related to reference rate reform. The pronouncement provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the current guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burden related to the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. The guidance was effective upon issuance and generally can be applied to applicable contract modifications through December 31, 2024. The adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance replacing the incurred loss impairment methodology with a new methodology that reflects current expected credit losses on financial assets, including receivables and available-for-sale securities. The new methodology requires entities to estimate and recognize expected credit losses each reporting period. The guidance was adopted during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 under the modified retrospective approach and resulted in a $ 2.2 million transition adjustment to opening shareholders’ retained deficit on our consolidated statements of equity. Note 2: Acquisitions, Divestitures and Strategic Alliance Fiscal 2023 On January 13, 2023, we sold the assets, primarily consisting of intellectual properties associated with the Seattle's Best Coffee brand, to Nestlé for $ 110.0 million. The transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $ 91.3 million, which was included in gain from sale of assets on our consolidated statements of earnings. Results from Seattle's Best Coffee operations prior to the sale are reported in our Channel Development operating segment. Fiscal 2022 In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we sold our Evolution Fresh brand and business to Bolthouse Farms. This transaction did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Fiscal 2021 In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we sold our 50 % ownership interest in Starbucks Coffee Korea Co., Ltd. where our joint venture partner, E-Mart Inc., acquired an additional 17.5 % interest and Apfin Investment Pte Ltd, an affiliate of GIC Private Limited, which is a Singapore sovereign wealth fund, acquired the remaining 32.5 %. The sale had a combined price of $ 1.175 billion. This transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $ 864.5 million, which is included in net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations on our consolidated statements of earnings. Note 3: Derivative Financial Instruments Interest Rates From time to time, we enter into designated cash flow hedges to manage the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates. We enter into interest rate swap agreements, including forward-starting interest rate swaps and 57 Table of Contents treasury locks, settled in cash based upon the difference between an agreed-upon benchmark rate and the prevailing benchmark rate at settlement. These agreements are generally settled around the time of the pricing of the related debt. Each derivative agreement's gain or loss is recorded in AOCI and is subsequently reclassified to interest expense over the life of the related debt. To hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap agreements, which are designated as fair value hedges. The changes in fair values of these derivative instruments and the offsetting changes in fair values of the underlying hedged debt due to changes in the relevant benchmark interest rates are recorded in interest expense. Refer to Note 9 , Debt, for additional information on our long-term debt. Foreign Currency To reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations, we enter into forward and swap contracts to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated intercompany royalty payments, inventory purchases and intercompany borrowing and lending activities. The resulting gains and losses from these derivatives are recorded in AOCI and subsequently reclassified to revenue, product and distribution costs, or interest income and other, net, respectively, when the hedged exposures affect net earnings. From time to time, we may enter into financial instruments, including, but not limited to, forward and swap contracts or foreign currency-denominated debt, to hedge the currency exposure of our net investments in certain international operations. The resulting gains and losses from these derivatives are recorded in AOCI and are subsequently reclassified to net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. Gains and losses from these derivatives representing hedged components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are amortized over the life of the hedging instrument using a systematic and rational method and recognized in interest expense. Foreign currency forward and swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments are used to mitigate the foreign exchange risk of certain other balance sheet items. Gains and losses from these derivatives are largely offset by the financial impact of translating foreign currency-denominated payables and receivables, and these gains and losses are recorded in interest income and other, net. Commodities Depending on market conditions, we may enter into coffee forward contracts, futures contracts and collars to hedge anticipated cash flows under our price-to-be-fixed green coffee contracts, which are described further in Note 5 , Inventories, or our longer-dated forecasted coffee demand where underlying fixed price and price-to-be-fixed contracts are not yet available. The resulting gains and losses are recorded in AOCI and are subsequently reclassified to product and distribution costs when the hedged exposure affects net earnings. Depending on market conditions, we may also enter into dairy forward contracts and futures contracts to hedge a portion of anticipated cash flows under our dairy purchase contracts and our forecasted dairy demand. The resulting gains or losses are recorded in AOCI and are subsequently reclassified to product and distribution costs when the hedged exposure affects net earnings. Cash flow hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the inception of each hedge. Cash flows from hedging transactions are classified in the same categories as the cash flows from the respective hedged items. For de-designated cash flow hedges in which the underlying transactions are no longer probable of occurring, the related accumulated derivative gains or losses are recognized in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. These derivatives may be accounted for prospectively as non-designated derivatives until maturity, re-designated to new hedging relationships or terminated early. We continue to believe transactions related to our other designated cash flow hedges are probable to occur. To mitigate the price uncertainty of a portion of our future purchases, including diesel fuel and other commodities, we enter into swap contracts, futures and collars that are not designated as hedging instruments. The resulting gains and losses are recorded in interest income and other, net to help offset price fluctuations on our beverage, food, packaging and transportation costs, which are included in product and distribution costs on our consolidated statements of earnings. 58 Table of Contents Gains and losses on derivative contracts and foreign currency-denominated debt designated as hedging instruments included in AOCI and expected to be reclassified into earnings within 12 months, net of tax ( in millions ): Net Gains/(Losses) Included in AOCI Net Gains/(Losses) Expected to be Reclassified from AOCI into Earnings within 12 Months Outstanding Contract/Debt Remaining Maturity (Months) Oct 1, 2023 Oct 2, 2022 Oct 3, 2021 Cash Flow Hedges: Coffee $ ( 78.1 ) $ 153.9 $ 197.8 $ ( 70.8 ) 6 Cross-currency swaps ( 0.6 ) ( 1.9 ) 4.4 — 14 Dairy ( 1.8 ) ( 2.6 ) ( 0.4 ) ( 1.8 ) 6 Foreign currency -

Proceeds from sales of securities we re $ 2.5 million, $ 72.6 million and $ 134.1 million for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Realized gains and losses were not material f or fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021. Gross unrealized holding gains and losses were not material as of October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022. 63 Table of Contents Marketable Equity Securities Marketable equity securities include equity mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. Our marketable equity securities portfolio approximates a portion of our liability under our MDCP, a defined contribution plan. Our MDCP liability was $ 90.4 million and $ 85.9 million as of October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, respectively. The changes in net unrealized holding gains and losses in the marketable equity securities portfolio included in earnings for fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021 were not material. Gross unrealized holding gains and losses on marketable equity securities were not material as of October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022 . Derivative Assets and Liabilities Derivative assets and liabilities are described further in Note 3 , Derivative Financial Instruments. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on the consolidated financial statements on a nonrecurring basis include items such as property, plant and equipment, ROU assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, equity and other investments and other assets. These assets are measured at fair value if determined to be impaired. Impairment of property, plant and equipment and ROU assets is included in Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates. We recognized impairments during fiscal years ended October 1, 2023, October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021. Impairments recognized in the fiscal year ended October 3, 2021 were primarily related to our restructuring plan. See Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates and Note 10 , Leases for additional discussion of these impairments. Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments The estimated fair value of our long-term debt based on the quoted market price (Level 2) is included at Note 9 , Debt. Note 5: Inventories (in millions) Oct 1, 2023 Oct 2, 2022 Coffee: Unroasted $ 747.7 $ 1,018.6 Roasted 280.3 310.3 Other merchandise held for sale 364.6 430.9 Packaging and other supplies 413.8 416.8 Total $ 1,806.4 $ 2,176.6 Other merchandise held for sale includes, among other items, serveware, food and tea. Inventory levels vary due to seasonality, commodity market supply and price fluctuations. As of October 1, 2023, we had committed to purchasing green coffee totaling $ 412 million under fixed-price contracts and an estimated $ 577 million under price-to-be-fixed contracts. A portion of our price-to-be-fixed contracts are effectively fixed through the use of futures. See Note 3 , Derivative Financial Instruments for further discussion. Price-to-be-fixed contracts are purchase commitments whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore the price, at which the base “C” coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established. For most contracts, either Starbucks or the seller has the option to “fix” the base “C” coffee commodity price prior to the delivery date. For other contracts, Starbucks and the seller may agree upon pricing parameters determined by the base “C” coffee commodity price. Until prices are fixed, we estimate the total cost of these purchase commitments. We believe, based on established relationships with our suppliers and continuous monitoring, the risk of non-delivery on these purchase commitments is remote. Note 6: Equity Investments (in millions) Oct 1, 2023 Oct 2, 2022 Equity method investments $ 415.7 $ 283.1 Other investments 24.2 28.1 Total $ 439.9 $ 311.2 Equity Method Investments As of October 1, 2023, we had a 50 % ownership interest in Tata Starbucks Limited (India), which operates licensed Starbucks ® retail stores. We also license the rights to produce and distribute Starbucks-branded products to our 50 % owned joint venture, The North American Coffee Partnership with the Pepsi-Cola Company, which develops and distributes bottled Starbucks ® beverages, 64 Table of Contents including Frappuccino coffee drinks, Starbucks Doubleshot espresso drinks, Starbucks ® Iced Espresso Classics and Starbucks ® Iced Coffee. Our share of income and losses from our equity method investments is included in income from equity investees on our consolidated statements of earnings. Also included in this line item is our proportionate share of gross profit resulting from coffee and other product sales to, and royalty and license fee revenues generated from, equity investees. Revenues generated from these entities were $ 85.7 million, $ 80.9 million and $ 160.8 million in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Related product and distribution costs were $ 85.6 million, $ 76.5 million and $ 92.1 million in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, there were $ 19.1 million and $ 14.8 million of accounts receivable from equity investees, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets, primarily related to product sales and royalty revenues. We also hold equity interests in other entities to support our corporate and investment strategies, including our limited partnership interest in Valor Siren Ventures I L.P. and Valor Siren Ventures II L.P, which are private equity funds investing in technologies, products and solutions relating to food or retail. The related financial statements activities were not material during the periods presented. Additional disclosure regarding changes in our equity method investments due to acquisition or divestiture is included in Note 2 , Acquisitions, Divestitures and Strategic Alliance. Other Investments We have equity interests in entities that develop and operate Starbucks licensed stores in several global markets, as well as in companies that support our strategic initiatives. We do not have significant influence over these entities and their fair values are not readily determinable. Therefore, we elected to measure these investments at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairment. 65 Table of Contents Note 7: Supplemental Balance Sheet and Statement of Earnings Information (in millions) Property, Plant and Equipment, net Oct 1, 2023 Oct 2, 2022 Land $ 46.1 $ 46.1 Buildings 666.5 555.4 Leasehold improvements 10,133.7 9,066.8 Store equipment 3,332.5 3,018.2 Roasting equipment 859.4 838.5 Furniture, fixtures and other 1,664.5 1,526.1 Work in progress 607.5 558.7 Property, plant and equipment, gross 17,310.2 15,609.8 Accumulated depreciation ( 9,923.1 ) ( 9,049.3 ) Property, plant and equipment, net $ 7,387.1 $ 6,560.5 Accrued Liabilities Oct 1, 2023 Oct 2, 2022 Accrued occupancy costs $ 86.7 $ 84.6 Accrued dividends payable 651.2 608.3 Accrued capital and other operating expenditures 771.7 878.1 Insurance reserves 233.5 232.3 Income taxes payable 189.3 139.2 Accrued business taxes 212.7 194.6 Total accrued liabilities $ 2,145.1 $ 2,137.1 Store Operating Expenses Year Ended Oct 1, 2023 Oct 2, 2022 Oct 3, 2021 Wages and benefits $ 8,733.4 $ 8,157.7 $ 6,989.3 Occupancy costs 2,871.0 2,674.1 2,561.5 Other expenses 3,115.9 2,730.0 2,380.1 Total store operating expenses $ 14,720.3 $ 13,561.8 $ 11,930.9 66 Table of Contents Note 8: Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets (in millions) Oct 1, 2023 Oct 2, 2022 Trade names, trademarks and patents $ 79.4 $ 97.5 Finite-Lived Intangible Assets Oct 1, 2023 Oct 2, 2022 (in millions) Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Amount Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Amount Acquired and reacquired rights $ 957.6 $ ( 957.6 ) $ — $ 990.0 $ ( 990.0 ) $ — Acquired trade secrets and processes 27.6 ( 27.6 ) — 27.6 ( 27.3 ) 0.3 Trade names, trademarks and patents 131.0 ( 91.9 ) 39.1 124.6 ( 69.6 ) 55.0 Licensing agreements 13.0 ( 11.0 ) 2.0 19.3 ( 16.2 ) 3.1 Other finite-lived intangible assets 20.1 ( 20.1 ) — 20.6 ( 20.6 ) — Total finite-lived intangible assets $ 1,149.3 $ ( 1,108.2 ) $ 41.1 $ 1,182.1 $ ( 1,123.7 ) $ 58.4 Amortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets was $ 21.5 million, $ 192.7 million and $ 223.4 million during fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

During the fiscal year ended October 1, 2023, we completed our annual goodwill impairment analysis. The results of our analysis indicated significant excess fair values over carrying values across the different reporting units, and therefore no goodwill impairment was recorded. Note 9: Debt Revolving Credit Facility Our $ 3.0 billion unsecured five-year revolving credit facility (the “2021 credit facility”), of which $ 150 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit, is currently set to mature on September 16, 2026 . The 2021 credit facility is available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases. We have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $ 1.0 billion. 67 Table of Contents Borrowings under the 2021 credit facility, which was most recently amended in April 2023, will bear interest at a variable rate based on Term SOFR, and, for U.S. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the 2021 credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on the Company’s long-term credit ratings assigned by the Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s rating agencies. The “Base Rate” is the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the 2021 credit facility) plus 0.500 %, (ii) Bank of America’s prime rate, and (iii) Term SOFR plus 1.000 %. Term SOFR means the forward-looking SOFR term rate administrated by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange plus a SOFR Adjustment of 0.100 %. The 2021 credit facility contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which measures our ability to cover financing expenses. As of October 1, 2023, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. No amounts were outstanding under our 2021 credit facility as of October 1, 2023 or October 2, 2022. Short-term Debt Under our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $ 3.0 billion, with individual maturities that may vary but not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. Amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program are required to be backstopped by available commitments under our 2021 credit facility. The proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper program may be used for working capital needs, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, business expansion, payment of cash dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. As of October 1, 2023, we had no borrowings outstanding under the program. As of October 2, 2022, we had $ 175.0 million in borrowings outstanding under this program. Additionally, we hold the following Japanese yen-denominated credit facilities that are available for working capital needs and capital expenditures within our Japanese market: • A ¥ 5 billion, or $33.5 million, credit facility is currently set to mature on January 4, 2024 . Borrowings under this credit facility are subject to terms defined within the facility and will bear interest at a variable rate based on Tokyo Interbank Offered Rate (“TIBOR”) plus an applicable margin of 0.400 %. • A ¥ 10 billion, or $67.0 million, credit facility is currently set to mature on March 27, 2024 .

Note 11: Deferred Revenue During fiscal 2018, we licensed the rights to sell and market our products in authorized channels through the Global Coffee Alliance and received an up-front prepaid royalty from Nestlé. The up-front payment of approximately $ 7 billion was recorded as deferred revenue as we have continuing performance obligations to support the Global Coffee Alliance, including providing Nestlé access to certain intellectual properties and products for future resale. The up-front payment is being recognized as other revenue on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life of the arrangement of 40 years for the ongoing access to the licenses within the contractual territories. Our obligations to maintain the Starbucks brand and other intellectual properties are generally constant throughout the term of the arrangement. Therefore, a ratable recognition pattern is reflective of how we will satisfy our performance obligations. As of October 1, 2023, the current and long-term deferred revenue related to the Nestlé up-front payment was $ 177.0 million and $ 6.0 billion, respectively. As of October 2, 2022, the current and long-term deferred revenue related to the Nestlé up-front payment was $ 177.0 million and $ 6.2 billion, respectively.

Note 13: Employee Stock and Benefit Plans We maintain several equity incentive plans under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) or stock appreciation rights to employees, non-employee directors and consultants. We issue new shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options and the vesting of RSUs. We also have an employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”). As of October 1, 2023, there were 92.6 million shares of common stock available for issuance pursuant to future equity-based compensation awards and 10.3 million shares available for issuance under our ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements (in millions) : Fiscal Year Ended Oct 1, 2023 Oct 2, 2022 Oct 3, 2021 RSUs $ 302.6 $ 271.8 $ 316.9 Options 0.1 ( 0.2 ) 2.2 Total stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings $ 302.7 $ 271.6 $ 319.1 Total related tax benefit $ 50.9 $ 45.9 $ 51.6 Total capitalized stock-based compensation included in net property, plant and equipment on the consolidated balance sheets $ 3.7 $ 3.9 $ 3.7 RSUs We have both time-vested and performance-based RSUs. Time-vested RSUs are awarded to eligible employees and entitle the grantee to receive shares of common stock at the end of a vesting period, subject to the employee’s continuing employment. The time-vested RSUs generally either vest in two or four equal annual installments beginning a year from the grant date. Our 73 Table of Contents performance-based RSUs are awarded to eligible employees and entitle the grantee to receive shares of common stock if we achieve specified performance goals during the performance period and the grantee remains employed through the vesting period. RSU transactions for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2023 (in millions, except per share and contractual life amounts) : Number of Shares Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value per Share Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life (Years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value Nonvested, October 2, 2022 7.0 $ 98.88 1.0 $ 587 Granted 4.5 97.66 Vested ( 3.1 ) 95.89 Forfeited/canceled ( 1.1 ) 95.28 Nonvested, October 1, 2023 7.3 99.56 1.0 670 As of October 1, 2023, total unrecogniz ed stock-based compensation expense related to nonvested RSUs, net of estimated forfeitures, was approximately $ 175 million , before income taxes, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.1 years . The total fair value of RSUs vested was $ 292 million, $ 298 million and $ 226 million during fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. For fiscal 2022 and 2021, the weighted average fair value per RSU granted was $ 107.71 and $ 96.05 , respectively. Stock Options We may provide stock options as a form of employee compensation, which are primarily time-vested. Stock options have not been broadly used as part of our compensation strategy in recent years. The majority of time-vested options become exercisable in four equal installments beginning a year from the grant date and generally expire 10 years from the grant date. Options granted to non-employee directors generally vest immediately or one year from grant. All outstanding stock options are non-qualified stock options. No stock options were granted during the fiscal years ended October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022. The fair value of stock option awards was estimated at the grant date with the following weighted average assumptions for fiscal 2021: Stock Options Granted During the Period Fiscal Year Ended 2021 Expected term (in years) 8.1 Expected stock price volatility 26.3 % Risk-free interest rate 1.4 % Expected dividend yield 1.6 % Weighted average grant price $ 110.46 Estimated fair value per option granted $ 27.59 The expected term of the options represents the estimated period of time until exercise and is based on historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior. Expected stock price volatility is based on a combination of historical volatility of our stock and the one-year implied volatility of Starbucks traded options, for the related vesting periods. The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term. The dividend yield assumption is based on our anticipated cash dividend payouts. The amounts shown above for the estimated fair value per option granted are before the estimated effect of forfeitures, which reduce the amount of expense recorded in the consolidated statements of earnings. 74 Table of Contents Stock option transactions for the fiscal year ended October 1, 2023 (in millions, except per share and contractual life amounts) : Shares Subject to Options Weighted Average Exercise Price per Share Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life (Years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value Outstanding, October 2, 2022 4.1 $ 55.86 3.6 $ 117 Granted — — Exercised ( 2.1 ) 56.55 Expired/forfeited 0.0 50.26 Outstanding, October 1, 2023 2.0 55.16 2.3 72 Exercisable, October 1, 2023 2.0 55.16 2.3 72 Vested, October 1, 2023 2.0 55.16 2.3 72 The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above, which is the amount by which the market value of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price of outstanding options, is before applicable income taxes and represents the amount optionees would have realized if all in-the-money options had been exercised on the last business day of the period indicated.

The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $ 98 million, $ 57 million and $ 219 million during fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. ESPP Our ESPP allows eligible employees to contribute up to 10 % of their base earnings toward the quarterly purchase of our common stock, subject to an annual maximum dollar amount. The purchase price is 95 % of the fair market value of the stock on the last business day of the quarterly offering period. The number of shares issued under our ESPP was 0.5 million in fiscal 2023. Deferred Compensation Plan We have a Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors under which non-employee directors may, for any fiscal year, irrevocably elect to defer receipt of shares of common stock the director would have received upon vesting of restricted stock units. The number of deferred shares outstanding related to deferrals made under this plan is not material. Defined Contribution Plans We maintain voluntary defined contribution plans, both qualified and non-qualified, covering eligible employees as defined in the plan documents. Participating employees may elect to defer and contribute a portion of their eligible compensation to the plans up to limits stated in the plan documents, not to exceed the dollar amounts set by applicable laws. Our matching contributions to all U.S. and non-U.S. plans were $ 178.1 million , $ 156.7 million and $ 145.1 million in fiscal 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 1, 2023 , in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of October 1, 2023 , based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 17, 2023, expresse d an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit and Compliance Committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Income Taxes — Indefinite Reinvestment of Foreign Earnings - Refer to Note 14 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description Under the provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes, (“ASC 740”), there is a presumption that investments in foreign subsidiaries will be recovered upon sale or through a partial or complete distribution of earnings to the parent entity, and therefore subject the parent entity to additional taxes. If sufficient evidence shows the foreign subsidiary has invested or will invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely, the ASC 740 presumption may be overcome, and no additional taxes shall be accrued. The Company has investments in the profitable operations of certain foreign subsidiaries that may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and/or U.S. federal and state income taxes upon sale or a partial or complete distribution of earnings, incremental to local income taxes already paid. As o f October 1, 2023 , th e Company is partially indefinitely reinvested in certain foreign subsidiaries. The Company has recorded an immaterial deferred tax liability related to the taxable temporary difference for which it is not indefinitely reinvested. For the remaining $2.5 billion of taxable temporary difference, there could be up to approximately $250 million of unrecognized tax liability. The Company’s assertion of partial indefinite reinvestment for certain foreign subsidiaries requires management to make long-term forecasting assumptions and detailed plans for reinvestment. The most significant assumption supporting the Company’s indefinite reinvestment assertion is the forecast of capital expenditures in international markets. Performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s indefinite reinvestment analysis and capital expenditures forecast required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our income tax specialists. 81 Table of Contents How the Critical Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our principal audit procedures related to management’s indefinite reinvestment analysis and the supporting forecast of capital expenditures for certain foreign subsidiaries, included the following, among others: • We tested the effectiveness of controls related to management’s forecast of capital expenditures. • We performed a retrospective review of management’s historical ability to accurately forecast capital expenditures by comparing actual results to management’s historical forecast. • We inquired of senior executives of the Company to corroborate strategic plans for growth. • We compared the forecasts obtained to support the indefinite reinvestment assertion to: ◦ Historical capital expenditures, including costs per new store opening; ◦ Historical new store growth; and ◦ Historical profitability of new stores by region; and ◦ Forecasts used by the Company for financial reporting purposes in other areas, such as the evaluation of the recoverability of goodwill; and ◦ Internal communications to management and the Board of Directors; and ◦ Forecasted information included in the Company’s press releases, other external communications and analyst reports; and ◦ External publications of expected industry growth. • With the assistance of our tax specialists, we evaluated the appropriateness of management’s analysis under ASC 740 and the sufficiency of the evidence provided by management to support that the Company has the intent and ability to partially indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Seattle, Washington November 17, 2023 We have served as the Company's auditor since 1987. 82 Table of Contents Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure Not applicable. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of the end of the period covered by this report (October 1, 2023). There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect internal control over financial reporting. The certifications required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 are filed as exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 , respectively, to this 10-K. Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework , issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. This evaluation included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of October 1, 2023. Our internal control over financial reporting as of October 1, 2023 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein. 83 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Starbucks Corporation Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Starbucks Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of October 1, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 1, 2023, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended October 1, 2023, of the Company and our report dated November 17, 2023, expre ssed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Seattle, Washington November 17, 2023 84 Table of Contents Item 9B.

Business General In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“10-K” or “Report”) for the fiscal year ended October 2, 2022 (“fiscal 2022”), Starbucks Corporation (together with its subsidiaries) is referred to as “Starbucks,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our.” Starbucks is the premier roaster, marketer and retailer of specialty coffee in the world, operating in 83 markets. Formed in 1985, Starbucks Corporation’s common stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “SBUX.” We purchase and roast high-quality coffees that we sell, along with handcrafted coffee, tea and other beverages and a variety of high-quality food items through company-operated stores. We also sell a variety of coffee and tea products and license our trademarks through other channels, such as licensed stores as well as grocery and foodservice through our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestlé S.A. (“Nestlé”). In addition to our flagship Starbucks Coffee ® brand, we sell goods and services under the following brands: Teavana ® , Seattle’s Best Coffee ® , Ethos ® , Starbucks Reserve ® and Princi ® . Our primary objective is to maintain Starbucks standing as one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world. We believe the continuous investments in our brand and operations will deliver long-term targeted revenue and income growth. This includes expansion of our global store base, adding stores in both existing, developed markets such as the U.S. and in higher growth markets such as China, as well as optimizing the mix of company-operated and licensed stores around the world. In addition, by leveraging experiences gained through our stores and elsewhere, we continue to drive beverage, equipment, process and technology innovation, including in our industry-leading digital platform. We strive to regularly offer consumers new, innovative coffee and other products in a variety of forms, across new categories, diverse channels and alternative store formats. Starbucks has always been a different kind of company – one deep with purpose, where we work together to create a positive impact in the world. With coffee at our core, we pursue ambitious goals for our partners (employees), our communities and our planet because we believe it is our role and responsibility to create a thriving business powered by thriving people for a thriving planet and communities. Starbucks work to uplift one another extends well beyond our partners to the communities where we do business around the world. We are committed to responsible and ethical sourcing led by Coffee and Farmer Equity (C.A.F.E.) Practices, the company’s third-party verification program and the cornerstone of our approach to ethical sourcing coffee, as well as a more sustainable, resilient future for our planet and for our communities. Human Capital Management We invest in the well-being – the mental, physical and financial health – of every partner through our practices, policies and benefits. This work is grounded in the belief that we are at our best when we create inclusive and welcoming environments, where we uplift one another with dignity, respect and kindness. And we are hard at work uplifting our communities and building environments in our stores that are welcoming and safe. We believe the strength of our workforce is one of the significant contributors to our success as a global brand that leads with purpose. Therefore, one of our core strategies is to invest in and support our partners to differentiate our brand, products and services in the competitive specialty coffee market, including the following areas of focus: Oversight and Management We recognize the diversity of customers, partners and communities and believe in creating an inclusive and equitable environment that represents a broad spectrum of backgrounds and cultures. Working under these principles, our Partner Resources Organization is tasked with managing employment-related matters, including recruiting and hiring, onboarding and training, compensation planning, performance management and professional development. Our Board of Directors (the “Board”) and Board committees provide oversight on certain human capital matters, including our Inclusion and Diversity programs and initiatives. As noted in its charter, our Compensation and Management Development Committee is responsible for periodically reviewing Starbucks partner resource programs and initiatives, including healthcare and other benefits, as well as our management development and succession planning practices and strategies. Our Audit and Compliance Committee works closely with the Risk Management Committee, led by Starbucks cfo and general counsel, to monitor and mitigate current and emerging labor and human capital management risks. Furthermore, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, in consultation with management, including our chief partner officer and chief inclusion and diversity officer, annually evaluates the effectiveness of our social responsibility policies, goals and programs, which also include partner-related issues. These reports and recommendations to the Board and its committees are part of the broader framework that guides how Starbucks should attract, retain and develop a skilled workforce that aligns with our values and strategies. We regularly conduct anonymous surveys to seek feedback from our partners on a variety of topics, including confidence in company leadership, competitiveness of our compensation and benefits package, career growth opportunities and recommendations on how we can remain an employer of choice. The results are shared with our partners and reviewed by 2 Table of Contents senior leadership, who analyze areas of progress or deterioration and prioritize actions and activities in response to this feedback to drive meaningful improvements in partner engagement. Our management and cross-functional teams also work closely to evaluate human capital management issues such as partner retention, workplace safety, harassment and bullying, as well as to implement measures to mitigate these risks. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion We are committed to creating a welcoming and inclusive environment. We believe it is our responsibility to advance racial and social equity, and we are committed to furthering that work with intention, transparency and accountability. We continue to welcome our partners, customers, civil rights and community leaders, along with our chief inclusion and diversity officer, to advise us along this journey. Starbucks has made specific racial equity commitments based on our principles of being intentional, transparent and accountable at all levels: • Being intentional in cultivating a culture of inclusion, with a focus on partner retention and development. ◦ Expanding our mentorship program designed to foster and deepen understanding of inclusion, diversity, equity and accessibility and provide partners in corporate and retail roles, including Black, Indigenous and people of color (“BIPOC”) and lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer and/or questioning (“LGBTQ+”) partners, development opportunities and connections with senior leaders. • Being transparent in our approach to Inclusion and Diversity goal setting and progress. ◦ Publicly sharing workforce diversity data. ◦ Setting annual Inclusion and Diversity goals based on retention rates and progress towards achieving BIPOC representation. Our goal is for at least 30% of all corporate roles and at least 40% of all retail and manufacturing roles to be held by BIPOC partners in the U.S. by 2025. • Holding ourselves accountable at the highest levels of the organization. ◦ Incorporating metrics focused on building inclusive and diverse teams into our executive compensation programs. ◦ Joining the Board Diversity Action Alliance to act alongside other companies similarly committed to increasing racially and ethnically diverse representation on corporate boards. ◦ Publicizing self-identified race/ethnicity/gender of each member of our Board. Total Rewards We have demonstrated a history of investing in our workforce by offering competitive salaries and wages by continuously assessing the current business environment and labor market. We have consistently made enhancements in wages in order to attract talent to support our growth strategy and to elevate the customer experience. To foster a stronger sense of ownership and align the interests of partners with shareholders, restricted stock units are provided to eligible non-executive partners under our broad-based stock incentive programs. Furthermore, we offer comprehensive, locally relevant and innovative benefits to all eligible partners. In the U.S., our largest and most mature market, these include: • Comprehensive health insurance coverage is offered to partners working an average of 20 hours or more each week. • 100% upfront tuition coverage is offered through the Starbucks College Achievement Plan for partners to earn a first-time bachelor's degree online at Arizona State University. • 100% paid parental leave is available to new parents that welcome a child through birth, adoption or foster placement and work an average of 20 hours or more each week. • A Partner and Family Sick Time program is provided and allows partners to accrue paid sick time based on hours worked and use that time for themselves or family members in need of care. • Care@Work benefit provides partners with backup care benefits for children and adults at a small cost to partners, as well as free unlimited senior care planning services. This benefit includes up to 30 days of backup care services through the end of fiscal 2022, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. • We view mental health as a fundamental part of our humanity and provide a comprehensive suite of related programs and benefits. These include a free subscription to Headspace, an online application that enables guided mediation, and 20 free mental health therapy or coaching sessions annually with Lyra. 3 Table of Contents Outside of the U.S., we have provided other innovative benefits to help address market-specific needs, such as providing interest-free loans to our U.K. partners to help cover rental deposits, mental health services in Canada, and in China, a monthly housing subsidy for full-time Starbucks baristas and shift supervisors, as well as comprehensive health insurance coverage for parents of partners. Role-based Support To help our partners succeed in their roles, we emphasize continuous training and development opportunities. These include, but are not limited to, safety and security protocols, updates on new products and service offerings and deployment of technologies. Training provided through our Pour Over sessions, which are a series of inspiring talks with thought leaders to help partners understand how to bring the Starbucks Experience to life, include a wide variety of topics such as achievable goal setting, giving and receiving constructive feedback and effective engagement with customers and communities. To help further promote an inclusive culture and to better serve our customers, we encourage U.S.-based partners to enroll in the To Be Welcoming courses we created in partnership with Arizona State University to address different forms of bias and discrimination. Pay Equity To be an employer of choice and maintain the strength of our workforce, we consistently assess the current business environment and labor market to refine our compensation and benefits programs and other resources available to our partners. We previously achieved and currently maintain 100 percent pay equity in the U.S. for women and men and people of all races for partners performing similar work. We have also achieved gender pay equity in China and Canada, two of our largest markets outside of the U.S., and we made a commitment to achieve gender pay equity in all company-operated markets. Further, we have formulated pay-equity principles which provide equal footing, transparency and accountability as best practices that help address known, systemic barriers to global pay equity. As of October 2, 2022, Starbucks employed approximately 402,000 people worldwide. In the U.S., Starbucks employed approximately 258,000 people, with approximately 248,000 in company-operated stores and the remainder in corporate support, store development, roasting, manufacturing, warehousing and distribution operations. Approximately 144,000 employees were employed outside of the U.S., with approximately 140,000 in company-operated stores and the remainder in regional support operations. Some Starbucks partners in company-operated stores are represented by unions, though it is an immaterial portion of our total workforce. We believe our efforts in managing our workforce have been effective, evidenced by a strong Starbucks culture and a good relationship between the company and our partners.

Segment Financial Information Segment information is prepared on the same basis that our management reviews financial information for operational decision-making purposes. We have three reportable operating segments: 1) North America, which is inclusive of the U.S. and Canada; 2) International, which is inclusive of China, Japan, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Latin America and Caribbean; and 3) Channel Development. Non-reportable operating segments and unallocated corporate expenses are reported within Corporate and Other. Revenues from our reportable operating segments as a percentage of total net revenues for fiscal 2022 were as follows: North America (72%), International (22%) and Channel Development (6%). Our North America and International segments include both company-operated and licensed stores. Our North America segment is our most mature business and has achieved significant scale. Certain markets within our International operations are in various stages of development and may require more extensive support, relative to their current levels of revenue and operating income, than our North America operations. Our Channel Development segment includes roasted whole bean and ground coffees, Seattle’s Best Coffee, Starbucks- and Teavana-branded single-serve products, a variety of ready-to-drink beverages, such as Frappuccino ® and Starbucks Doubleshot ® , foodservice products and other branded products sold worldwide outside of our company-operated and licensed stores. A large portion of our Channel Development business operates under a licensed model of the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestlé, while our global ready-to-drink businesses operate under collaborative relationships with PepsiCo, Inc., Tingyi-Ashi Beverages Holding Co., Ltd., Arla Foods amba, Nestlé and others. 5 Table of Contents Revenue Components We generate the majority of our revenues through company-operated stores and licensed stores. Company-operated and Licensed Store Summary as of October 2, 2022: North America As a % of Total North America Stores International As a % of Total International Stores Total As a % of Total Stores Company-operated stores 10,216 59 % 8,037 44 % 18,253 51 % Licensed stores 7,079 41 % 10,379 56 % 17,458 49 % Total 17,295 100 % 18,416 100 % 35,711 100 % The mix of company-operated versus licensed stores in a given market generally varies based on several factors, including our ability to access desirable local retail space, the complexity, profitability and expected ultimate size of the market for Starbucks and our ability to leverage the support infrastructure within a geographic region. Company-operated Stores Revenue from company-operated stores accounted for 82% of total net revenues during fiscal 2022. Our retail objective is to be the leading retailer and brand of coffee and tea in each of our target markets by selling the finest quality coffee, tea and related products, as well as complementary food offerings, and by providing each customer with a unique Starbucks Experience . The Starbucks Experience is built upon superior customer service, convenience and a seamless digital experience as well as safe, clean and well-maintained stores that reflect the personalities of the communities in which they operate, thereby building a high degree of customer loyalty. Our strategy for expanding our global retail business is to increase our category share in a disciplined manner, by selectively opening additional stores in new and existing markets, as well as increasing sales in existing stores, to support our long-term strategic objective to maintain Starbucks standing as one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world. Store growth in specific existing markets will vary due to many factors, including expected financial returns, the maturity of the market, economic conditions, consumer behavior and local business environment.

Our ability to vary the size and format of our stores allows us to locate them in or near a variety of settings, including downtown and suburban retail centers, office buildings, university campuses and rural and off-highway locations. We are continuing the expansion of our stores, particularly drive-thru formats that provide a higher degree of access and convenience, and alternative store formats, which are designed to provide a more streamlined customer experience in dense metropolitan areas. In fiscal 2022, we announced our plan in the U.S. market to increase efficiency while elevating the partner and customer experience (the “Reinvention Plan”). We believe the investments in partner wages and trainings will increase retention and 6 Table of Contents productivity while the acceleration of purpose-built store concepts and innovations in technologies will provide additional convenience and connection with our customers. In our major international markets, we also continue to invest in technology and establish partnerships with third parties with relevant expertise to increase digital adoption to provide convenience and elevate the customer experience. In China, we leverage platforms such as Starbucks Now TM stores to enable a seamless integration of physical and digital customer touchpoints. Orders may be placed in advance through the Starbucks Mobile App or Starbucks Delivers TM and can be conveniently picked up by customers and delivery providers in these express retail format locations. These strategies align closely with rapidly evolving customer preferences, including higher levels of mobile ordering, more contactless pick-up experiences and reduced in-store congestion, all of which naturally allow for greater physical distancing. We announced plans to invest in a digital third place that will offer members access to new benefits, a digital community and immersive coffee experiences, giving our customers new ways to experience and connect with Starbucks. We believe our continued efforts to transform our store portfolio and elevate technology will enhance the customer experience and position Starbucks for long-term growth. Retail sales mix by product type for company-operated stores: Fiscal Year Ended Oct 2, 2022 Oct 3, 2021 Sep 27, 2020 Beverages 74 % 74 % 75 % Food 22 % 21 % 20 % Other (1) 4 % 5 % 5 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % (1) “Other” primarily consists of sales of packaged and single-serve coffees and teas, serveware and ready-to-drink beverages, among other items. Stored Value Cards and Loyalty Program The Starbucks Card, our branded stored value card program, is designed to provide customers with a convenient payment method, support gifting and increase the frequency of store visits by cardholders, in part through the related Starbucks ® Rewards loyalty program where available, as discussed below. Stored value cards are issued to customers when they initially load them with an account balance. They can be obtained in our company-operated and most licensed stores in North America, China, Japan and many of our markets in our International segment. Stored value cards can also be obtained online, via the Starbucks ® Mobile App and through other U.S. and international retailers. Customers may access their card balances by utilizing their stored value card or the Starbucks Mobile App in participating stores. In nearly all markets, including the U.S. and Canada, customers who register their Starbucks Cards are automatically enrolled in the Starbucks Rewards program. Registered members can receive various benefits depending on factors such as the number of reward points (“Stars”) earned. In addition to using their Starbucks Cards, Starbucks Rewards members can earn Stars by paying with cash, credit or debit cards, or selected mobile wallets at all company-operated stores and a majority of licensed stores in North America. Using the Mobile Order and Pay functionality of the Starbucks Mobile App, customers can also place orders in advance for pick-up at certain participating locations in several markets. Refer to Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, for further discussion of our stored value cards and loyalty program. Licensed Stores Revenues from our licensed stores accounted for 11% of total net revenues in fiscal 2022. Licensed stores generally have a lower gross margin and a higher operating margin than company-operated stores. Under the licensed model, Starbucks receives a margin on branded products and supplies sold to the licensed store operator along with a royalty on retail sales. Licensees are responsible for operating costs and capital investments, which more than offset the lower revenues we receive under the licensed store model. In our licensed store operations, we seek to leverage the expertise of our local partners and share our operating and store development experience. Licensees provide improved, and at times the only, access to desirable retail space. Most licensees are prominent retailers with in-depth market knowledge and access. As part of these arrangements, we sell coffee, tea, food and related products to licensees for resale to customers and receive royalties and license fees from the licensees. We also sell certain equipment, such as coffee brewers and espresso machines, to our licensees for use in their operations. Licensee employees working in licensed retail locations are required to follow our detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to employees in company-operated stores. In a limited number of international markets, we also use traditional franchising and include these stores in the results of operations from our other licensed stores. 7 Table of Contents Licensed store data for the fiscal year-ended October 2, 2022: Stores Open as of Stores Open as of Oct 3, 2021 Opened Closed Transfers Net Oct 2, 2022 North America: U.S. 6,497 217 (109) 3 111 6,608 Canada 468 27 (24) — 3 471 Total North America 6,965 244 (133) 3 114 7,079 International: Korea 1,611 168 (29) — 139 1,750 Latin America 1,437 115 (3) — 112 1,549 U.K. 791 74 (30) 3 47 838 Turkey 559 50 (5) — 45 604 Taiwan 523 30 (9) — 21 544 Indonesia 487 48 (12) — 36 523 Thailand 425 27 (6) — 21 446 Philippines 401 19 (2) — 17 418 All Other 3,501 394 (188) — 206 3,707 Total International 9,735 925 (284) 3 644 10,379 Total licensed 16,700 1,169 (417) 6 758 17,458 Other Revenues Other revenues primarily are recorded in our Channel Development segment and include sales of packaged coffee, tea and ready-to-drink beverages to customers outside of our company-operated and licensed stores, as well as royalties received from Nestlé under the Global Coffee Alliance and other collaborative partnerships. Product Supply Starbucks is committed to selling the finest whole bean coffees and coffee beverages. To help ensure compliance with our rigorous coffee standards, we generally control substantially all coffee purchasing, roasting and packaging and the global distribution of coffee used in our operations. Nestlé controls distribution of certain finished goods through the Global Coffee Alliance. We purchase green coffee beans from multiple coffee-producing regions around the world and custom roast them to our exacting standards for our many blends and single-origin coffees. The price of coffee is subject to significant volatility. Although most coffee trades in the commodity market, high-altitude arabica coffee of the quality sought by Starbucks tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the “C” coffee commodity price. Both the premium and the commodity price depend upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase. Supply and price can be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, including weather, water supply quality and availability throughout the coffee production chain, natural disasters, crop disease and pests, general increase in farm inputs and costs of production, inventory levels and political and economic conditions. Climate change may further exacerbate many of these factors. Price is also impacted by trading activities in the arabica coffee futures market, including hedge funds and commodity index funds. In addition, green coffee prices have been affected in the past, and may be affected in the future, by the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies. We buy coffee using fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed purchase commitments, depending on market conditions, to secure an adequate supply of quality green coffee. We also utilize forward contracts, futures contracts and collars to hedge “C” price exposure under our price-to-be-fixed green coffee contracts and our long-term forecasted coffee demand where underlying fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed contracts are not yet available. Total purchase commitments, together with existing inventory, are expected to provide an adequate supply of green coffee through fiscal 2023. We depend upon our relationships with coffee producers, outside trading companies and exporters for our supply of green coffee. We believe, based on relationships established with our suppliers, the risk of non-delivery on such purchase commitments is remote. To help ensure the future supply of high-quality green coffee and to reinforce our leadership role in the coffee industry, Starbucks operates ten farmer support centers, including our China Farmer Support Center located in the Yunnan Province of 8 Table of Contents this high-growth market. Farmer support centers are staffed with agronomists and sustainability experts who work with coffee farming communities to promote best practices in coffee production designed to improve both coffee quality and yields and agronomy support to address climate change and other impacts. In addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy and plant-based dairy-free alternative products, particularly fluid milk, oat milk and almond milk to support the needs of our company-operated stores. We believe, based on relationships established with our dairy and plant-based dairy-free suppliers, that the risk of non-delivery of sufficient fluid milk and plant-based dairy-free alternatives to support our stores generally is remote. Products other than whole bean coffees and coffee beverages sold in Starbucks stores include tea and a number of ready-to-drink beverages that are purchased from several specialty suppliers, usually under long-term supply contracts. Food products, such as pastries, breakfast sandwiches and lunch items, are purchased from national, regional and local sources. We also purchase a broad range of paper and plastic products, such as cups and cutlery, from several companies to support the needs of our retail stores as well as our manufacturing and distribution operations. We are also expanding our use of reusable packaging to reduce landfill waste. We believe, based on relationships established with these suppliers and manufacturers, that the risk of non-delivery of sufficient amounts of these items generally is remote. During fiscal 2021 and continuing into fiscal 2022, we experienced certain supply shortages and transportation delays largely attributable to impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as changes in customer demand and behaviors. While we expect these shortages and delays may continue into fiscal 2023, we view them to be temporary and do not believe they will have a material impact to our long-term growth and profitability. Competition Our primary competitors for coffee beverage sales are specialty coffee retailers and shops. We believe that our customers choose among specialty coffee retailers and shops primarily on the basis of product quality, brand reputation, service and convenience, as well as price. We continue to experience direct competition from large competitors in the quick-service restaurant sector and the ready-to-drink coffee beverage market, in addition to both well-established and start-up companies in many international markets. We also compete with restaurants and other specialty retailers for prime retail locations and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores. Our coffee and tea products sold through our Channel Development segment compete directly against specialty coffees and teas sold through grocery stores, warehouse clubs, specialty retailers, convenience stores and foodservice accounts and compete indirectly against all other coffees and teas on the market. Trademarks, Copyrights, Patents and Domain Names Starbucks owns and has applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and in other countries throughout the world. Some of our trademarks, including Starbucks, the Starbucks logo, Starbucks Reserve and Frappuccino are of material importance. The duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained. We own numerous copyrights for items such as product packaging, promotional materials, in-store graphics and training materials. We also hold patents on certain products, systems and designs which have an average remaining useful life of approximately seven years. In addition, Starbucks has registered and maintains numerous Internet domain names, including “Starbucks.com,” “Starbucks.net” and “Starbucksreserve.com.” Seasonality and Quarterly Results Our business is subject to moderate seasonal fluctuations, of which our second fiscal quarter typically experiences lower revenues and operating income. The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on consumer behaviors and customer traffic; however, it is not yet certain that these changes will sustain and cause other than temporary changes in the seasonal fluctuations of our business. Additionally, as Starbucks Cards are issued to and loaded by customers during the holiday season, we tend to have higher cash flows from operations during the first quarter of the fiscal year. However, since revenues from Starbucks Cards are recognized upon redemption and not when cash is loaded onto the Card, the impact of seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings is much less pronounced. As a result of moderate seasonal fluctuations, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year. Government Regulation As a company with global operations, we are subject to the laws and regulations of the United States and the multiple foreign jurisdictions in which we operate as well as the rules, reporting obligations and interpretations of all such requirements and obligations by various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions. In addition, changes to such laws, regulations, rules, reporting obligations and related compliance obligations could result in significant costs but are not expected to have a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position as compared to prior periods. 9 Table of Contents Available Information Starbucks Annual Report on Form 10-K reports, along with all other reports and amendments filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”), are publicly available free of charge on the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.starbucks.com as soon as reasonably practicable after these materials are filed with or furnished to the SEC.

Risk Factors You should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations section, the Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk section and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. If any of the risks and uncertainties described in the cautionary factors described below actually occur or continue to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. The considerations and risks that follow are organized within relevant headings but may be relevant to other headings as well. Moreover, the risks below are not the only risks we face and additional risks not currently known to us or that we presently deem immaterial may emerge or become material at any time and may negatively impact our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations or the trading price of our common stock. Risks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions • Our financial condition and results of operations are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, a number of macroeconomic and other factors, many of which are also largely outside our control. Our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to a number of macroeconomic and other factors, many of which are largely outside our control. Any one or more of the factors listed below or described elsewhere in this risk factors section could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations: • increases in real estate costs in certain domestic and international markets; • inflationary pressures; • disruptions to our supply chain; • changes in governmental rules and approaches to taxation; • fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; • adverse outcomes of litigation; • severe weather or other natural or man-made disasters affecting a large market or several closely located markets that may temporarily but significantly affect our retail business in such markets; • changes in climate, including changes to the frequency of severe weather events, that impact the price and availability or cost of goods and services, energy and other materials throughout our supply chain; and • especially in our largest markets, including the U.S. and China, labor discord or disruption, geopolitical events, war, terrorism (including incidents targeting us), political instability, acts of public violence, boycotts, increasing anti-American sentiment in certain markets, hostilities and social unrest and other health pandemics that lead to avoidance of public places or restrictions on public gatherings such as in our stores. • Economic conditions in the U.S. and international markets could adversely affect our business and financial results. As a retailer that is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending, our results of operations are sensitive to changes in or uncertainty about macroeconomic conditions. A continued economic downturn or recession, or slowing or stalled recovery therefrom, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our customers may have or in the future have less money for discretionary purchases and may stop or reduce their purchases of our products or switch to Starbucks or competitors’ lower-priced products as a result of various factors, including job losses, inflation, higher taxes, reduced access to credit, changes in federal economic policy, the COVID-19 pandemic and recent international trade disputes. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic or other global health events, we may experience a reduction and increased volatility in demand for our products. Such reductions and volatility may be caused by, among other things: store closures or modified operating hours and business model, reduced customer traffic due to illness, quarantine or government or self-imposed 10 Table of Contents restrictions placed on our stores’ operations, impacts caused by precautionary measures such as those related to face coverings and vaccinations and changes in consumer spending behaviors, including those caused by social distancing, a decrease in consumer confidence in general macroeconomic conditions and a decrease in consumer discretionary spending. Decreases in customer traffic and/or average value per transaction without a corresponding decrease in costs would put downward pressure on margins and would negatively impact our financial results. There is also a risk that if negative economic conditions or uncertainty, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or any other public health emergency, persist for a long period of time or worsen, consumers may make long-lasting changes to their discretionary purchasing behavior, including less frequent discretionary purchases on a more permanent basis or there may be a general downturn in the restaurant industry. These and other macroeconomic factors could have an adverse effect on our sales, profitability or development plans, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition. • Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance and fluctuations in the stock market as a whole will likely adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock. Failure to meet market expectations going forward, particularly with respect to our operational and financial results, and expectations regarding the success of our Reinvention Plan and related guidance, environmental performance and shareholder returns, will likely result in a decline and/or increased volatility in the market price of our stock. In addition, price and volume fluctuations in the stock market as a whole may affect the market price of our stock in ways that may be unrelated to our financial performance. Risks Related to COVID-19 • Our financial condition and results of operations have been and are expected to continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and is continuing to have, a significant impact on our business and results of operations. At the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak, many of our company-operated and licensed stores were closed. For stores that remained open, same-store sales declined due to modified operating hours and reduced customer traffic. While nearly all of our company-operated and licensed stores have reopened, we expect that certain parts of our operations will continue to be impacted by the continuing effects of COVID-19, including resurgences and variants of the virus. Our China market experienced unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic-related restrictions in multiple cities that severely impacted customer mobility. It remains difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the broader economy and how consumer behavior may change, and whether such change is temporary or permanent. Social distancing, telecommuting and reductions in travel may become the new normal. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has required and may continue to require us to make controversial decisions about precautionary measures, such as vaccinations, showing proof of vaccinations and face coverings, that could impact our results, including by impacting our brand, our employee retention and satisfaction and the willingness of customers to buy our products. All of these conditions could fundamentally impact the way we work and the services we provide, and could have continuing adverse effects on our financial performance. As a result, we may incur additional impairment charges to our inventory, store and corporate assets—and our ability to realize the benefits from deferred tax assets may become limited—any of which may have a significant or material impact on our financial results. Prolonged volatility or significant disruption of global financial markets due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic could have a negative impact on our ability to access capital markets and other funding sources, on acceptable terms or at all and impede our ability to comply with debt covenants. Risks Related to Our Business If our business partners and third-party providers do not satisfactorily fulfill their responsibilities and commitments, it could damage our brand and our financial results could suffer. Our global business strategy, including our plans for new stores, branded products and other initiatives, relies significantly on a variety of business partners, including licensee and joint venture relationships, third-party manufacturers, distributors and retailers, particularly for our entire global Channel Development business. Licensees, retailers and foodservice operators are often authorized to use our logos and provide branded food, beverage and other products directly to customers. We believe our customers expect the same quality of service regardless of whether they visit a licensed or company-operated store, so we provide training and support to, and monitor the operations of, certain of these licensees and other business partners. However, the product quality and service they deliver may still be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control, including financial constraints, adherence to sanitation protocols and guidance (including those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic), labor shortages and other factors. We do not have direct control over our business partners and may not have visibility into their practices. 11 Table of Contents We also source our food, beverage and other products from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners, and in certain cases such products are produced or sourced by our licensees directly. And although foodservice operators are authorized to use our logos and provide branded products as part of their foodservice business, we do not monitor the quality of non-Starbucks products served in those locations. Additionally, inconsistent uses of our brand and other of our intellectual property assets, as well as failure to protect our intellectual property, can erode consumer trust and our brand value and have a material negative impact on our financial results. • Incidents involving food or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, adulteration, contamination or mislabeling, whether or not accurate, as well as adverse public or medical opinions about the health effects of consuming our products, could harm our business. Instances or reports, whether true or not, of unclean water supply or food-safety issues, such as food or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, adulteration, contamination or mislabeling, either during growing, manufacturing, packaging, storing or preparation, have in the past severely injured the reputations of companies in the food and beverage processing, grocery and quick-service restaurant sectors. Any report linking us to such instances could severely hurt our sales and could possibly lead to product liability claims, litigation (including class actions) and/or temporary store closures. Clean water is critical to the preparation of coffee, tea and other beverages, as well as ice for our cold beverages, and our ability to ensure adequate supplies of clean water and ice to our stores can be limited, particularly in some international locations. We are also continuing to incorporate more products in our food and beverage lineup that require freezing or refrigeration, which increases the risk of food safety related incidents if correct temperatures are not maintained due to mechanical malfunction or human error. We also face risk by relying on third-party food suppliers to provide and transport ingredients and finished products to our stores. While we monitor the operations of certain of these business partners, the product quality and service they deliver may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control and it may be difficult to detect contamination or other defects in these products. There is greater risk from those we do not monitor, or do not monitor as closely. Furthermore, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there are stricter health regulations and guidelines and increased public concern over food safety standards and controls. Potential food safety incidents, whether at our stores or involving our business partners, could lead to wide public exposure, which could materially harm our business. Additionally, we are evolving our product lineup to include more local or smaller suppliers for some of our products who may not have as rigorous quality and safety systems and protocols as larger or more national suppliers, especially in light of the heightened safety protocols as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, instances of food or beverage-safety issues, even those involving solely the restaurants or stores of competitors or of suppliers or distributors (regardless of whether we use or have used those suppliers or distributors), could adversely affect our sales on a regional or global basis by resulting in negative publicity about us or the foodservice industry in general. A decrease in customer traffic as a result of food-safety concerns or negative publicity, or as a result of a temporary closure of any of our stores, product recalls, viral-contaminated food or beverage claims or other food or beverage-safety claims or litigation, could materially harm our business and results of operations. • We may not be successful in implementing important strategic initiatives or effectively managing growth, which may have an adverse impact on our business and financial results. There is no assurance that we will be able to implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations or that they will generate expected returns, which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results. These strategic initiatives, which includes our Reinvention Plan, are designed to create growth, improve our results of operations and drive long-term shareholder value, and include: • being an employer of choice and investing in employees to deliver a superior customer experience; • building our leadership position around coffee; • driving convenience, brand engagement and digital relationships through our mobile, loyalty, delivery and digital capabilities both domestically and internationally; • simplifying store administrative tasks to allow store partners to better engage with customers; • increasing the scale of the Starbucks store footprint with disciplined global expansion and introducing flexible and unique store formats, including the accelerated development of alternative store formats (such as Starbucks Pickup stores, Starbucks Now stores and curbside pickup) especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic; • adjusting rapidly to changing customer preferences and behaviors in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, inflation and changing economic conditions; • moving to a more licensed store model in some markets and a more company-operated model in certain markets; 12 Table of Contents • creating new occasions in stores across all dayparts with new product offerings, including our growing lunch food and beverage product lineup; • continuing the global growth of our Channel Development business through our supply, distribution and licensing agreements with Nestlé and other Channel Development business partners; • delivering continued growth in our cold beverage business; • working to address the potential effects of climate change and the sustainability of our business; and • reducing our operating costs, particularly general and administrative expenses. In addition to other factors listed in this risk factors section, factors that may adversely affect the successful implementation of these initiatives, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results, include the following: • imposition of additional taxes by jurisdictions, such as on certain types of beverages or based on number of employees; • construction cost increases associated with new store openings and remodeling of existing stores; delays in store openings for reasons beyond our control, such as potential shortages of materials and labor and delays in permits, or a lack of desirable real estate locations available for lease at reasonable rates, either of which could keep us from meeting annual store opening targets in the U.S. and internationally; • governmental regulations or other health guidelines concerning operations of stores, including due to the COVID-19 pandemic or other public health emergencies; • not successfully scaling our supply chain infrastructure as our product offerings increase and as we continue to expand, including our emphasis on a broad range of high-quality food offerings; • not successfully adapting to customer or market factors affecting our supply chain as we work to address sustainability and climate change; and • the deterioration in our credit ratings, which could limit the availability of additional financing and increase the cost of obtaining financing to fund our initiatives. Effectively managing growth can be challenging, particularly as we expand in international markets where we must balance the need for flexibility and a degree of autonomy for local management against the need for consistency with our goals, policies and standards. If we are not successful in implementing our strategic initiatives, or, in the event we undertake large acquisitions, integrations and divestitures, we may be required to evaluate whether certain assets, including goodwill and other intangibles, have become impaired. In the event we record an impairment charge, it could have a material impact on our financial results. • Evolving consumer preferences and tastes may adversely affect our business. Our continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain customers. Our financial results could be adversely affected by a shift in consumer spending away from outside-the-home food and beverages (such as the disruption caused by online commerce that results in reduced foot traffic to “brick & mortar” retail stores); lack of customer acceptance of new products (including due to price increases necessary to cover the costs of new products or higher input costs), brands (such as the global expansion of the Starbucks brand) and platforms (such as features of our mobile technology, changes in our loyalty rewards programs, the Starbucks Odyssey experience and our delivery services initiatives); or customers reducing their demand for our current offerings as new products are introduced. In addition, some of our products contain caffeine, dairy products, sugar and other compounds and allergens, the health effects of which are the subject of public and regulatory scrutiny, including the suggestion of linkages to a variety of adverse health effects. Particularly in the U.S., there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks, including obesity, as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food and beverage products. While we have a variety of beverage and food items, including items that are coffee-free and have reduced calories, an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in our products, whether accurate or not, imposition of additional taxes on certain types of food and beverage components, or negative publicity or litigation arising from certain health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our beverages and food products and could materially harm our business and results of operations. Furthermore, our financial results have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in a disruption of customer routines, changes to employer “work-from-home” policies, reduced business and recreational travel and changes in consumer behavior and the ability or willingness to spend discretionary income on our products. 13 Table of Contents Risks Related to Brand Relevance and Brand Execution • Our success depends substantially on the value of our brands and failure to preserve their value could have a negative impact on our financial results. We believe we have built an excellent reputation globally for the quality of our products, for delivery of a consistently positive consumer experience and for our global social and environmental impact programs. The Starbucks brand is recognized throughout most of the world, and we have received high ratings in global brand value studies. To be successful in the future, particularly outside of the U.S. where the Starbucks brand and our other brands are less well-known, we believe we must preserve, grow and leverage the value of our brands across all sales channels. Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities. Business incidents, whether isolated or recurring and whether originating from us or our business partners, that erode consumer trust can significantly reduce brand value, potentially trigger boycotts of our stores or result in civil or criminal liability and can have a negative impact on our financial results. Such incidents include actual or perceived breaches of privacy or violations of domestic or international privacy laws, contaminated food, product recalls, store employees or other food handlers infected with communicable diseases, such as COVID-19, safety-related incidents or other potential incidents discussed in this risk factors section. The impact of such incidents may be exacerbated if they receive considerable publicity, including rapidly through social or digital media (including for malicious reasons) or result in litigation. Consumer demand for our products and our brand equity could diminish significantly if we, our employees, licensees or other business partners fail to preserve the quality of our products, act or are perceived to act in an unethical, illegal, racially-biased, unequal or socially irresponsible manner, including with respect to the sourcing, content or sale of our products, service and treatment of customers at Starbucks stores, treatment of employees or the use of customer data for general or direct marketing or other purposes. Furthermore, if we are not effective in addressing our social and environmental program goals, executing on our Reinvention Plan, or achieving relevant sustainability goals, consumer trust in our brand may suffer, and this perception could result in negative publicity or litigation. Additionally, if we fail to comply with laws and regulations, take controversial positions or actions or fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience in each of our markets, including by failing to invest in the right balance of wages and benefits to attract and retain employees that represent the brand well or to foster an inclusive and diverse environment, our brand value may be diminished. The ongoing relevance of our brand may depend on the success of our social and environmental program goals as well as the success of the Reinvention Plan, which requires company-wide coordination and alignment. We are working to manage risks and costs to us, our licensees and our supply chain of any effects of climate change as well as diminishing energy and water resources. These risks include any increased public focus, including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations, on these and other environmental sustainability matters, including packaging and waste, animal health and welfare, deforestation and land use. These risks may also include any increased pressure to make commitments, set targets or establish additional goals and take actions to meet them, which could expose us to market, operational and execution costs or risks. • We may not be successful in our marketing, promotional and advertising plans and pricing strategies. Our continued success depends in part on our ability to adjust our marketing, promotional and advertising plans and pricing strategy to respond quickly and effectively to shifting economic and competitive conditions as well as evolving customer preferences. We operate in a complex and costly marketing, promotional and advertising environment. Our marketing, promotional and advertising programs may not be successful in reaching our customers in the way we intend. Our success depends in part on whether the allocation of our advertising, promotional and marketing resources across different channels, including digital marketing, allows us to reach our customers effectively and efficiently, and in ways that are meaningful to them. If the advertising, promotional and marketing programs or our pricing strategies are not successful, or are not as successful as those of our competitors, our sales and market share could decrease. Finally, customers are focusing more on sustainability and the environmental impacts of operations. An inability to meet customer expectations with respect to these issues could adversely affect our financial results. Risks Related to Cybersecurity and Data Privacy • Failure to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain privacy and data protections laws and regulations may subject us to substantial negative financial consequences and civil or criminal penalties. Complex local, state, national, foreign and international laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal data. These privacy and data protection laws and regulations are quickly evolving, with new or modified laws and regulations proposed and implemented frequently and existing laws and regulations subject to new or different interpretations and enforcement. In addition, our legal and regulatory obligations in jurisdictions outside the U.S. are subject to unexpected changes, including the potential for regulatory or other governmental entities to enact new or additional laws or regulations, to issue rulings that invalidate prior laws or regulations or to increase penalties 14 Table of Contents significantly. Complying with these laws and regulations can be costly and can impede the development and offering of new products and services. For example, Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and the U.K. General Data Protection Regulation (which implements the GDPR into U.K. law), impose stringent data protection requirements and provide for significant penalties for noncompliance. Additionally, California enacted legislation, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). The CCPA requires, among other things, covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers and allows such consumers new abilities to opt-out of certain sales of personal data. The CCPA also provides for civil penalties for violations as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act, which was passed in November 2020 and is fully effective in January 2023, significantly modifies the CCPA. Colorado, Connecticut, Utah and Virginia recently enacted similar data privacy legislation that will also take effect in 2023, and several other states and countries are considering expanding or passing privacy laws in the near term. These modifications and new laws will require us to incur additional costs and expenses in our efforts to comply. In June 2021, the European Commission published new versions of the Standard Contractual Clauses and in March 2022, the U.K. finalized the U.K. International Data Transfer Agreement. The new requirements will require us to incur costs and expenses in order to comply and may impact the transfer of personal data throughout our organization and to third parties. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other obligations to which we may be subject relating to personal data, or to protect personal data from unauthorized access, use or other processing, could result in enforcement actions and regulatory investigations against us, claims for damages by customers and other affected individuals, fines, damage to our brand reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial performance and business. • The unauthorized access, use, theft or destruction of customer or employee personal, financial or other data or of Starbucks proprietary or confidential information that is stored in our information systems or by third parties on our behalf could impact our reputation and brand and expose us to potential liability and loss of revenues. Many of our information technology systems (whether cloud-based or hosted in proprietary servers), including those used for our point-of-sale, web and mobile platforms, online and mobile payment systems, delivery services and rewards programs and administrative functions, contain personal, financial or other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and employees. Many of our information technology systems also contain Starbucks proprietary and other confidential information related to our business, such as business plans and product development initiatives and designs, and confidential information about third parties, such as licensees and business partners. Similar to many other retail companies and because of the prominence of our brand, we are consistently subject to attempts to compromise our information technology systems from both internal and external sources. The number and frequency of these attempts varies from year to year but could be exacerbated to some extent by an increase in our digital operations, including our efforts to comply with state and local mandates in response to COVID‑19. In addition, we provide some customer and employee data, as well as Starbucks proprietary information and other confidential information important to our business, to third parties where necessary to conduct our business, including licensees and business partners. Individuals performing work for Starbucks and such third parties also may possess some of this data, including on personally-owned digital devices. To the extent we, a third party or such an individual were to experience a breach of our or their information technology systems that results in the unauthorized access, theft, use, destruction or other compromises of customers’ or employees’ data or confidential information of the Company stored in or transmitted through such systems, including through cyber-attacks or other external or internal methods, it could result in a material loss of revenues from the potential adverse impact to our reputation and brand, a decrease in our ability to retain customers or attract new ones, the imposition of potentially significant costs (including loss of data or payment for recovery of data) and liabilities, loss of business, loss of business partners and licensees and the disruption to our supply chain, business and plans. Unauthorized access, theft, use, destruction or other compromises may occur through a variety of methods, including attacks using malicious code, those taking advantage of vulnerabilities in software, hardware or other infrastructure (including systems used by our supply chain), those using techniques aimed at convincing those with access to such data or information to share passwords or otherwise allow access through deceit or otherwise and those taking advantage of inadequate account security practices. Such security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable U.S. and international privacy, cyber and other laws or trigger U.S. state data breach notification laws, and subject us to private consumer, business partner or licensee or securities litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings, any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability. Significant capital investments and other expenditures could also be required to investigate security incidents, remedy cybersecurity problems, recuperate lost data, prevent future compromises and adapt systems and practices to react to the changing threat environment. These include costs associated with notifying affected individuals and other agencies, additional security technologies, trainings, personnel, experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached. These costs, which could be material, could adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred, 15 Table of Contents including by interfering with the pursuit of other important business strategies and initiatives, and may not meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to breach our information technology systems. Media or other reports of existing or perceived security vulnerabilities in our systems or those of our third-party business partners or service providers can also adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially impact our business. Additionally, the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyber-attacks and compromise information technology systems, as well as the sources and targets of these attacks, change frequently and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time. We continue to make significant investments in technology, third-party services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyber-attacks and to prevent or minimize breaches of our information technology systems or data loss, but these security measures cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches or data loss. • We rely heavily on information technology in our operations and growth initiatives, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate and grow our business and could adversely affect our financial results. We rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations for numerous purposes including for administrative functions, point-of-sale processing and payment in our stores and online, management of our supply chain, Starbucks Cards, online business, delivery services, mobile technology, including mobile payments and ordering apps, reloads and loyalty functionality and various other processes and transactions, and many of these systems are interdependent on one another for their functionality. Additionally, the success of several of our initiatives to drive growth, including our ability to increase digital relationships with our customers to drive incremental traffic and spend, is highly dependent on our technology systems. Furthermore, due to the social distancing measures put in place as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we accelerated the transformation of our store portfolio by expanding convenience-led formats, which depend heavily on our mobile ordering capabilities. We also rely on third-party providers and platforms for some of these information technology systems and support. Additionally, our systems hardware, software and services provided by third-party service providers are not fully redundant within a market or across our markets. Although we have operational safeguards in place, they may not be effective in preventing the failure of these systems or platforms to operate effectively and be available. Such failures may be caused by various factors, including power outages, climate change-related impacts, catastrophic events, physical theft, computer and network failures, inadequate or ineffective redundancy, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or platforms, flaws in third-party software or services, errors or improper use by our employees or third-party service providers, or a breach in the security of these systems or platforms, including through cyber-attacks such as those that result in the blockage of our or our third-party business partners’ or service providers’ systems and platforms and those discussed in more detail in this risk factors section. If our incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective and timely manner, they could result in an interruption in our operations and could cause material negative impacts to our product availability and sales, the efficiency of our operations and our financial results. In addition, remediation of any problems with our systems could result in significant, unplanned expenses. Risks Related to Intellectual Property • We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property or adequately ensure that we are not infringing the intellectual property of others, which could harm the value of our brand and our business. The success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets. We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products. We have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. The trademarks that we currently use have not been registered in all of the countries outside of the U.S. in which we do business or may do business in the future and may never be registered in all of these countries. It may be costly and time consuming to protect our intellectual property, and the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the U.S. and foreign countries may not be adequate. In addition, the steps we have taken may not adequately ensure that we do not infringe the intellectual property of others, and third parties may claim infringement by us in the future. Any claim of infringement, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and harm our business. In addition, we cannot ensure that licensees will not take actions that hurt the value of our intellectual property. Risks Related to Supply Chain • Our reliance on key business partners may adversely affect our business and operations. The growth of our business relies on the ability of our licensee partners to implement our growth platforms and product innovations as well as on the degree to which we are able to enter into, maintain, develop and negotiate appropriate terms and 16 Table of Contents conditions of, and enforce, commercial and other agreements and the performance of our business partners under such agreements. Our international licensees may face capital constraints or other factors that may limit the speed at which they are able to expand and develop in a certain market. Our Channel Development business is heavily reliant on Nestlé, which has the right to sell and distribute our packaged goods and foodservice products to retailers and operators, with few exceptions. If Nestlé fails to perform its distribution and marketing commitments under our agreements and/or fails to support, protect and grow our brand in Channel Development, our Channel Development business could be adversely impacted for a period of time, present long-term challenges to our brand, limit our ability to grow our Channel Development business and have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results. Additionally, the growth of our Channel Development business is in part dependent on the level of discretionary support provided by our retail and licensed store businesses. There are generally a relatively small number of licensee partners operating in specific markets. If they are not able to access sufficient funds or financing, or are otherwise unable or unwilling to successfully operate and grow their businesses it could have a material adverse effect on our results in the markets. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our financial results have been and could continue in the future to be adversely affected by the disruption to the operations of our business partners, including licensee relationships, third-party manufacturers, distributors and retailers, through the effects of business and facilities closures, reductions in operating hours, social, economic, political or labor instability in affected areas, transportation delays, travel restrictions and changes in operating procedures, including for additional cleaning and safety protocols. • Increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities or decreases in the availability of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results. The availability and prices of coffee beans and other commodities are subject to significant volatility. We purchase, roast and sell high-quality whole bean arabica coffee beans and related coffee products. The high-quality arabica coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the “C” price. This premium depends upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and the amount of the premium can vary significantly. Increases in the “C” coffee commodity price increase the price of high-quality arabica coffee and also impact our ability to enter into fixed-price purchase commitments. We frequently enter into supply contracts whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore price, at which the base “C” coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established. The supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, such as weather, water supply quality and availability throughout the coffee production chain, natural disasters, crop disease and pests, general increase in farm inputs and costs of production, inventory levels, political and economic conditions and the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies. Climate change may further exacerbate many of these factors. Speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices. For example, drought conditions in Brazil have and, given continued drought conditions, are predicted to continue to impact coffee prices. Because of the significance of coffee beans to our operations, combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities, increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. In addition, if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or due to a worldwide or regional shortage, we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee, which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial performance. We also purchase significant amounts of dairy products, particularly fluid milk, to support the needs of our company-operated retail stores. Additionally, and although less significant to our operations than coffee or dairy, other commodities, including tea and those related to food and beverage inputs, such as cocoa, produce, baking ingredients, meats, eggs and energy, as well as the processing of these inputs, are important to our operations. Increases in the cost of dairy products and other commodities, or lack of availability, whether due to supply shortages, delays or interruptions in processing, or otherwise, especially in international markets, could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. Similarly, increases in the cost of, or lack of availability, whether due to supply shortages, delays or interruptions in the processing of plant-based alternatives could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. • Interruption of our supply chain could affect our ability to produce or deliver our products and could negatively impact our business and profitability. Any material interruption in our supply chain, such as material interruption of roasted coffee supply due to the casualty loss of any of our roasting plants, interruptions in service by our third-party logistic service providers or common carriers that ship goods within our distribution channels, trade restrictions, such as increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes or customs restrictions, pandemics, social or labor unrest, labor shortages, natural disasters or political disputes and military conflicts that cause a material disruption in our supply chain could have a negative material impact on our business and our profitability. Additionally, our food, beverage and other products are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners in our supply chain operations, and in certain cases are produced or sourced by our licensees directly. We rely on these 17 Table of Contents suppliers to provide high-quality products and to comply with applicable laws. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge as we increase our fresh and prepared food offerings, especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the U.S. and from countries or regions with diminished infrastructure, developing or failing economies or which are experiencing political instability or social unrest. For certain products, we may rely on one or very few suppliers. A supplier's failure to meet our standards, provide products in a timely and efficient manner or comply with applicable laws is beyond our control. These issues could have a material negative impact on our business and profitability. Risks Related to Human Capital • Changes in the availability of and the cost of labor could adversely affect our business. Our business could be adversely impacted by increases in labor costs, including wages and benefits, which, in a retail business such as ours, are two of our most significant costs, both domestically and internationally, including those increases triggered by state and federal legislation and regulatory actions regarding wages, scheduling and benefits; increased healthcare and workers’ compensation insurance costs; increased wages and costs of other benefits necessary to attract and retain high-quality employees with the right skill sets and increased wages, benefits and costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The growth of our business can make it increasingly difficult to locate and hire sufficient numbers of employees, to maintain an effective system of internal controls for a globally dispersed enterprise and to train employees worldwide to deliver a consistently high-quality product and customer experience, which could materially harm our business and results of operations. Furthermore, we have experienced, and could continue to experience, a shortage of labor for store positions, including due to market trends and conditions such as continued concerns around COVID-19, the availability of new telecommuting employment options and other factors, which could decrease the pool of available qualified talent for key functions. Such labor shortages could be further exacerbated by expanded COVID-19 vaccination requirements. In addition, our wages and benefits programs may be insufficient to attract and retain the best talent. Starting in December 2021, Starbucks partners at company-operated stores in multiple jurisdictions across the U.S. began filing for unionization elections and a number of these stores have now successfully unionized, with potentially more to follow. While the number of partners represented by unions is not significant, if a significant portion of our employees were to become unionized, our labor costs could increase and our business could be negatively affected by other requirements and expectations that could increase our costs, change our employee culture, decrease our flexibility and disrupt our business. Additionally, our responses to any union organizing efforts could negatively impact how our brand is perceived and have adverse effects on our business, including on our financial results. These responses could also expose us to legal risk, causing us to incur costs to defend legal and regulatory actions, potential penalties and restrictions or reputational harm. • The loss of key personnel or difficulties recruiting and retaining qualified personnel could adversely impact our business and financial results. Much of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of senior management personnel. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key senior management personnel could harm our business. Our success also depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of our retail store employees on whom we rely to give customers a superior in-store experience and elevate our brand. Accordingly, our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain high-quality management personnel and other employees to work in and manage our stores, both domestically and internationally. Our ability to attract and retain corporate, retail and other personnel is also acutely impacted in certain international and domestic markets where the competition for a relatively small number of qualified employees is intense or in markets where large high-tech companies are able to offer more competitive salaries and benefits. Additionally, there is intense competition for qualified technology systems developers necessary to develop and implement new technologies for our growth initiatives, including increasing our digital relationships with customers. If we are unable to recruit, retain and motivate employees sufficiently to maintain our current business and support our projected growth, our business and financial performance may be adversely affected. Environmental, Social and Governance Risk Factors • Our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations and expectations, including with respect to environmental, social and governance matters, that could expose us to numerous risks. We are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self-regulatory organizations, including the SEC, the Nasdaq Stock Market and the Financial Accounting Standards Board. These rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by Congress, making compliance more difficult and uncertain. In addition, increasingly regulators, customers, investors, employees and other stakeholders are focusing on environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters and related disclosures. These changing rules, regulations and stakeholder expectations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and increased management time and attention spent complying with or meeting such regulations and expectations. For example, developing and acting on initiatives within the scope of ESG, and 18 Table of Contents collecting, measuring and reporting ESG related information and metrics can be costly, difficult and time consuming and is subject to evolving reporting standards, including the SEC’s recently proposed climate-related reporting requirements, and similar proposals by other international regulatory bodies. We may also communicate certain initiatives and goals, regarding environmental matters, diversity, responsible sourcing and social investments and other ESG related matters, in our SEC filings or in other public disclosures. These initiatives and goals within the scope of ESG could be difficult and expensive to implement, the technologies needed to implement them may not be cost effective and may not advance at a sufficient pace, and we could be criticized for the accuracy, adequacy or completeness of the disclosure. Further, statements about our ESG related initiatives and goals, and progress against those goals, may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future. In addition, we could be criticized for the scope or nature of such initiatives or goals, or for any revisions to these goals. If our ESG-related data, processes and reporting are incomplete or inaccurate, or if we fail to achieve progress with respect to our goals within the scope of ESG on a timely basis, or at all, our reputation, business, financial performance and growth could be adversely affected. • Climate change may have an adverse impact on our business. While we seek to mitigate our business risks associated with climate change by establishing environmental goals and standards and seeking business partners, including within our supply chain, that are committed to operating in ways that protect the environment or mitigate environmental impacts, we recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. For example, as we noted above, the supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, such as weather and water supply quality and availability, which factors may be caused by or exacerbated by climate change. We operate in 83 markets globally. While we believe this geographic diversity is likely to lessen the impact of individual climate change related events on our financial results, our properties and operations may nonetheless be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change, which are predicted to increase the frequency and severity of weather events and other natural cycles such as wildfires and droughts. Such events have the potential to disrupt our operations, cause store closures, disrupt the business of our third-party suppliers and impact our customers, all of which may cause us to suffer losses and additional costs to maintain or resume operations. Risks Related to Competition • We face intense competition in each of our channels and markets, which could lead to reduced profitability. The specialty coffee market is intensely competitive, including with respect to product quality, innovation, service, convenience, such as delivery service and mobile ordering, and price, and we face significant and increasing competition in all of these areas in each of our channels and markets. Accordingly, we do not have leadership positions in all channels and markets. In the U.S., the ongoing focus by large competitors in the quick-service restaurant sector on selling high-quality specialty coffee beverages could lead to decreases in customer traffic to Starbucks ® stores and/or average value per transaction adversely affecting our sales and results of operations. Similarly, continued competition from well-established competitors, or competition from large new entrants or well-funded smaller companies, in our domestic and international markets could hinder growth and adversely affect our sales and results of operations in those markets. Many small competitors also continue to open coffee specialty stores in many of our markets across the world, which in the aggregate may also lead to significant decreases of customer traffic to our stores in those markets. Increased competition globally in packaged coffee and tea and single-serve and ready-to-drink coffee beverage markets, including from new and large entrants to this market, could adversely affect the profitability of the Channel Development segment. In addition, not all of our competitors may seek to establish environmental or sustainability goals at a comparable level to ours, which could result in lower supply chain or operating costs for our competitors. We may incur increased costs associated with reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, reducing the use of plastic or imposing performance obligations on our suppliers that could increase financial obligations for us and our business partners and could affect our profitability. Additionally, if we are unable to respond to consumer demand for healthy beverages and foods, or our competitors respond more effectively, this could have a negative effect on our business. Furthermore, declines in general consumer demand for specialty coffee products for any reason, including due to consumer preference for other products, flattening demand for our products, changed customer daily routines or traffic to stores as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, or changed customer spending behaviors due to challenging economic conditions, could have a negative effect on our business. Risks Related to Operating a Global Business We are highly dependent on the financial performance of our North America operating segment. Our financial performance is highly dependent on our North America operating segment, which comprised approximately 72% of consolidated total net revenues in fiscal 2022. If the North America operating segment revenue trends slow or decline, especially in our U.S. market, our other segments may be unable to make up any significant shortfall and our business and financial results could be adversely affected. And because the North America segment is relatively mature and produces the 19 Table of Contents large majority of our operating cash flows, such a slowdown or decline could result in reduced cash flows for funding the expansion of our international businesses and other initiatives and for returning cash to shareholders. • We are increasingly dependent on the success of certain international markets in order to achieve our growth targets. Our future growth increasingly depends on the growth and sustained profitability of certain international markets. Some or all of our international market business units (“MBUs”), which we generally define by the countries in which they operate, may not be successful in their operations or in achieving expected growth, which ultimately requires achieving consistent, stable net revenues and earnings. The performance of these international operations may be adversely affected by economic downturns in one or more of the countries in which our large MBUs operate. A decline in performance of one or more of our significant international MBUs could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results. The International segment is a significant profit center driving our global returns, along with our North America segment. In particular, our China MBU contributes meaningfully to both consolidated and International net revenues and operating income. China is currently our fastest growing market, our second largest market overall and 100% company-owned. Due to the significance of our China market for our profit and growth, we are exposed to risks in China, including the risks mentioned elsewhere and the following: • the effects of current U.S.-China relations, including rounds of tariff increases and retaliations and increasing restrictive regulations, potential boycotts and increasing anti-Americanism; • escalating U.S.-China tension and increasing political sensitivities in China; • the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental regulations and restrictions on our operations in China, including China's “zero COVID” policy; • entry of new competitors to the specialty coffee market in China; • changes in economic conditions in China and potential negative effects to the growth of its middle class, wages, labor, inflation, discretionary spending and real estate and supply chain costs; • ongoing government regulatory reform, including relating to public health, food safety, tariffs and tax, sustainability and responses to climate change, which result in regulatory uncertainty as well as potential significant increases in compliance costs; and • food-safety related matters, including compliance with food-safety regulations and ability to ensure product quality and safety. Additionally, some factors that will be critical to the success of our international operations overall are different than those affecting our U.S. stores and licensees. Tastes naturally vary by region, and consumers in some MBUs may not embrace our products to the same extent as consumers in the U.S. or other international markets. Occupancy costs and store operating expenses can be higher internationally than in the U.S. due to higher rents for prime store locations or costs of compliance with country-specific regulatory requirements. Because many of our international operations are in an early phase of development, operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues are often higher compared to more developed operations. • We face risks as a global business that could adversely affect our financial performance. We operate in 83 markets globally. Our international operations are also subject to additional inherent risks of conducting business abroad, such as: • foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, or requirements to transact in specific currencies; • changes or uncertainties in economic, legal, regulatory, social and political conditions in our markets, as well as negative effects on U.S. businesses due to increasing anti-American sentiment in certain markets; • interpretation and application of laws and regulations, including tax, tariffs, labor, merchandise, anti-bribery and privacy laws and regulations; • restrictive actions of foreign or U.S. governmental authorities affecting trade and foreign investment, especially during periods of heightened tension between the U.S. and such foreign governmental authorities, including protective measures such as export and customs duties and tariffs, government intervention favoring local competitors and restrictions on the level of foreign ownership; • import or other business licensing requirements; • the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights; • limitations on the repatriation of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions due to current or new U.S. and international regulations; 20 Table of Contents • in developing economies, the growth rate in the portion of the population achieving sufficient levels of disposable income may not be as fast as we forecast; • difficulty in staffing, developing and managing foreign operations and supply chain logistics, including ensuring the consistency of product quality and service, due to governmental actions affecting supply chain logistics, distance, language and cultural differences, as well as challenges in recruiting and retaining high-quality employees in local markets; • local laws that make it more expensive and complex to negotiate with, retain or terminate employees; • local regulations, health guidelines and safety protocols related to the COVID-19 pandemic affecting our operations; and • delays in store openings for reasons beyond our control, competition with locally relevant competitors or a lack of desirable real estate locations available for lease at reasonable rates, any of which could keep us from meeting annual store opening targets and, in turn, negatively impact net revenues, operating income and earnings per share. Moreover, many of the foregoing risks are particularly acute in developing countries, which are important to our long-term growth prospects. Risks Related to Governmental and Regulatory Changes • Failure to comply with applicable laws and changing legal and regulatory requirements could harm our business and financial results. Our policies and procedures are designed to comply with all applicable laws, accounting and reporting requirements, tax rules and other regulations and requirements, including those imposed by the SEC, Nasdaq and foreign countries, as well as applicable trade, labor, healthcare, food and beverage, sanitation, safety, environmental, labeling, anti-bribery and corruption and merchandise laws. Such laws and regulations are complex and often subject to differing interpretations, which can lead to unintentional or unknown instances of non-compliance. Changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations, including increased or additional regulations and associated costs to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, to discourage the use of plastic or to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use, may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures, incremental investments and other financial obligations for us and our business partners, which could affect our profitability. Furthermore, due to the COVID‑19 pandemic, we are subject to additional domestic and foreign governmental regulations and health guidelines, as well as any other voluntary safety protocols. In addition, our business is subject to complex and rapidly evolving U.S. and international laws and regulations regarding data privacy and data protection, and companies are under increased regulatory scrutiny relating to these matters. The Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are also interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of data. The interpretation and application of existing laws and regulations regarding data privacy and data protection are in flux and authorities around the world are considering a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals in this area. Current and future data privacy and data protection laws and regulations (including the GDPR and the CCPA, discussed in more detail in this risk factors section, and other applicable international and U.S. privacy laws), or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may limit our ability to collect and use data, require us to otherwise modify our data processing practices and policies or result in the possibility of fines, litigation or orders, which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The burdens imposed by these and other laws and regulations that may be enacted, or new interpretations of existing and future laws and regulations, may also require us to incur substantial costs in reaching compliance in a manner adverse to our business. The complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related costs of compliance are both increasing due to additional or changing legal and regulatory requirements, our ongoing expansion into new markets and new channels and the fact that foreign laws occasionally conflict with domestic laws. In addition to potential damage to our reputation and brand, failure by us or our business partners to comply with the various applicable laws and regulations, as well as changes in laws and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied, may result in litigation, civil and criminal liability, damages, fines and penalties, increased cost of regulatory compliance and restatements of our financial statements and have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.

All references to store counts, including data for new store openings, are reported net of related store closures, unless otherwise noted. Fiscal year 2022 included 52 weeks. Fiscal year 2021 included 53 weeks, with the 53rd week falling in the fourth fiscal quarter, and fiscal year 2020 included 52 weeks; comparable store sale percentages below are calculated excluding the 53rd week. The discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year ended September 27, 2020, included in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) can be found in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 3, 2021. Overview We have three reportable operating segments: 1) North America, which is inclusive of the U.S. and Canada; 2) International, which is inclusive of China, Japan, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean; and 3) Channel Development. Non-reportable operating segments and unallocated corporate expenses are reported within Corporate and Other. Our financial results and long-term growth model will continue to be driven by new store openings, comparable store sales and margin management. We believe these key operating metrics are useful to investors because management uses these metrics to assess the growth of our business and the effectiveness of our marketing and operational strategies. Throughout this MD&A, we commonly discuss the following key operating metrics: • New store openings and store count • Comparable store sales • Operating margin Starbucks results for fiscal 2022 demonstrate the resiliency and strength of our brand. Consolidated revenues increased 11% to $32.3 billion in fiscal 2022 compared to $29.1 billion in fiscal 2021, primarily driven by strength in our U.S. business and growth in our International segment excluding China, partially offset by the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2021 ($496 million) and unfavorable foreign currency translation. For both the North America segment and U.S. market, comparable store sales increased 12% for fiscal 2022 compared to an increase of 22% and 21% for the North America segment and the U.S. market, respectively, in fiscal 2021. Average ticket for the North America segment and the U.S. market grew 7% and 8%, respectively, primarily driven by strategic pricing and increased demand for food items in our U.S. market. The segment also experienced higher costs, primarily related to investments and growth in labor including enhanced store partner wages as well as increased spend on new partner training. Also contributing were inflationary pressures on commodities and our supply chain. In fiscal 2022, we announced our Reinvention Plan in the U.S. market to increase efficiency while elevating the partner and customer experience. We believe the investments in partner wages and training will increase retention and productivity while the acceleration of purpose-built store concepts and innovations in technologies will provide additional convenience and connection with our customers. For the International segment, comparable store sales decreased by 9% for fiscal 2022 compared to an increase of 16% in fiscal 2021, driven by comparable store sales decline of 24% in our China market. During the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2022, our China market experienced COVID-19 pandemic related restrictions in multiple cities that severely impacted customer mobility. Outside of China, strong growth in our major International markets, driven by product innovation and increasing digital capabilities, partially offset the unfavorability in our China market. Revenue for our Channel Development segment increased $250 million, or 16%, when compared with fiscal 2021, driven by higher product sales to and royalty revenue from the Global Coffee Alliance and growth in our global ready-to-drink business. Operating margin decreased 520 basis points to 44.3%, primarily due to a decline in our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture income due to inflationary pressures and supply chain constraints as well as business mix shift. Despite COVID-19 induced business interruptions, especially in our China market, we have seen the strength and resilience of our brand as well as strong customer demand across our portfolio. We expect inflationary pressures on commodities and supply chain to continue to a lesser extent in fiscal 2023, relative to the impact on our business and financial metrics, including operating margin, as compared to fiscal 2022. We anticipate that these should be offset by benefits from pricing decisions as well as from increased sales leverage and higher productivity driven by our Reinvention Plan. Absent significant and prolonged COVID-19 relapses or global economic disruptions, and based on the current trend of our business operations and our focused efforts on the Reinvention Plan, we are confident in the strength of our brand and strategy for sustainable, profitable growth over the long-term. 26 Table of Contents Financial Highlights • Total net revenues increased 11% to $32.3 billion in fiscal 2022 compared to $29.1 billion in fiscal 2021, inclusive of $576 million attributable to the extra week in fiscal 2021. • Consolidated operating income decreased to $4.6 billion in fiscal 2022 compared to $4.9 billion in fiscal 2021. Fiscal 2022 operating margin was 14.3% compared to 16.8% in fiscal 2021. Operating margin contraction of 250 basis points was primarily due to investments and growth in labor, including enhanced retail store partner wages (approximately 290 basis points) as well as increased spend on new partner training and support costs (approximately 80 basis points). Also contributing were inflationary pressures on commodities and our supply chain (approximately 270 basis points), sales deleverage related to COVID-19 pandemic related impacts in our China market (approximately 110 basis points), business mix shift (approximately 60 basis points) and lower government subsidies (approximately 60 basis points). These increases were partially offset by sales leverage across markets outside of China (approximately 390 basis points) and strategic pricing, primarily in North America (approximately 320 basis points). • Diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) for fiscal 2022 decreased to $2.83, compared to EPS of $3.54 in fiscal 2021. The decrease was primarily driven by lapping the prior year $0.56 gain, net of estimated taxes, on the divestiture of our South Korea joint venture and $0.10 related to the extra week in fiscal 2021. Also contributing were investments in labor and inflationary pressures on commodities and our supply chain, partially offset by growth in comparable store sales and lower restructuring costs. • Capital expenditures were $1.8 billion in fiscal 2022 and $1.5 billion in fiscal 2021. • We returned $6.3 billion to our shareholders in fiscal 2022 through share repurchases and dividends. We returned $2.1 billion in fiscal 2021 through dividends. In April 2022, we announced a temporary suspension of our share repurchase program to allow us to augment investments in our stores and partners. We resumed our share repurchase program in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — FISCAL 2022 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2021 Consolidated results of operations (in millions) : Revenues Fiscal Year Ended Oct 2, 2022 Oct 3, 2021 % Change Net revenues: Company-operated stores $ 26,576.1 $ 24,607.0 8.0 % Licensed stores 3,655.5 2,683.6 36.2 Other 2,018.7 1,770.0 14.1 Total net revenues $ 32,250.3 $ 29,060.6 11.0 % Total net revenues increased $3.2 billion, or 11%, over fiscal 2021, primarily due to higher revenues from company-operated stores ($2.0 billion). The growth in company-operated store revenue was driven by an 8% increase in comparable store sales ($1.8 billion) attributed to a 5% increase in average ticket and 2% increase in comparable transactions. Also contributing were the incremental revenues from 1,120 net new Starbucks company-operated store openings, or a 7% increase, over the past 12 months ($1.0 billion). Partially offsetting these increases was the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2021 ($496 million) and unfavorable foreign currency translation ($368 million). Licensed stores revenue increased $972 million, primarily driven by higher product and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($922 million) and the conversion of our Korea market from a joint venture to a fully licensed market in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 ($187 million). Partially offsetting these increases were unfavorable foreign currency translation ($81 million) and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2021 ($57 million). Other revenues increased $249 million, primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenue in the Global Coffee Alliance ($216 million) and growth in our ready-to-drink business ($44 million). Partially offsetting these increases was the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2021 ($23 million). 27 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Fiscal Year Ended Oct 2, 2022 Oct 3, 2021 Oct 2, 2022 Oct 3, 2021 As a % of Total Net Revenues Product and distribution costs $ 10,317.4 $ 8,738.7 32.0 % 30.1 % Store operating expenses 13,561.8 11,930.9 42.1 41.1 Other operating expenses 461.5 359.5 1.4 1.2 Depreciation and amortization expenses 1,447.9 1,441.7 4.5 5.0 General and administrative expenses 2,032.0 1,932.6 6.3 6.7 Restructuring and impairments 46.0 170.4 0.1 0.6 Total operating expenses 27,866.6 24,573.8 86.4 84.6 Income from equity investees 234.1 385.3 0.7 1.3 Operating income $ 4,617.8 $ 4,872.1 14.3 % 16.8 % Store operating expenses as a % of related revenues 51.0 % 48.5 % Product and distribution costs as a percentage of total net revenues increased 190 basis points, primarily due to higher supply chain costs due to inflationary pressures. Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 100 basis points. Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues increased 250 basis points, primarily due to investments and growth in labor, including enhanced retail store partner wages (approximately 320 basis points) as well as increased spend on new partner training and support costs (approximately 90 basis points). Also contributing were lower temporary government subsidies (approximately 70 basis points). These increases were partially offset by sales leverage. Other operating expenses increased $102 million, primarily due to lapping a change in estimate relating to a transaction cost accrual ($23 million), higher support costs for our growing North America and International licensed stores ($22 million), transaction costs associated with our Russia market exit ($20 million) and strategic investments in technology and other initiatives ($15 million). Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 50 basis points, primarily due to sales leverage. General and administrative expenses increased $99 million, primarily due to incremental investments in technology ($92 million), increased partner wages and benefits ($59 million) and higher support costs to address labor market conditions ($36 million). These increases were partially offset by lower performance-based compensation ($95 million). Restructuring and impairment expense s decreased $124 million, primarily due to lower costs incurred related to our Reinvention Plan in the current year compared to prior year's North America store portfolio optimization, including lower accelerated lease right-of-use asset amortization costs ($84 million) and asset impairment charges ($68 million), partially offset by higher professional fees and higher severance costs ($27 million). Income from equity investees decreased $151 million, primarily due to the conversion of our Korea market from a joint venture to a fully licensed market in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 ($140 million) and lower income from our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture ($18 million). The combination of these changes resulted in an overall decrease in operating margin of 250 basis points in fiscal 2022 when compared to fiscal 2021. 28 Table of Contents Other Income and Expenses Fiscal Year Ended Oct 2, 2022 Oct 3, 2021 Oct 2, 2022 Oct 3, 2021 As a % of Total Net Revenues Operating income $ 4,617.8 $ 4,872.1 14.3 % 16.8 % Net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations — 864.5 — 3.0 Interest income and other, net 97.0 90.1 0.3 0.3 Interest expense (482.9) (469.8) (1.5) (1.6) Earnings before income taxes 4,231.9 5,356.9 13.1 18.4 Income tax expense 948.5 1,156.6 2.9 4.0 Net earnings including noncontrolling interests 3,283.4 4,200.3 10.2 14.5 Net earnings/(loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 1.8 1.0 0.0 0.0 Net earnings attributable to Starbucks $ 3,281.6 $ 4,199.3 10.2 % 14.5 % Effective tax rate including noncontrolling interests 22.4 % 21.6 % Net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations decreased $865 million due to lapping the sale of our ownership interest in our South Korea joint venture in the prior year. Interest expense increased $13 million primarily due to additional interest incurred on long-term debt issued in February 2022. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 was 22.4% compared to 21.6% for fiscal 2021. The increase was due to lapping a prior year remeasurement of deferred tax assets due to an enacted foreign corporate rate change (approximately 130 basis points) and lapping the release of income tax reserves upon expiration of statute of limitations (approximately 70 basis points), partially offset by the release of valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets of a certain international jurisdiction (approximately 120 basis points). See Note 14 , Income Taxes, for further discussion. The Inflation Reduction Act was enacted on August 16, 2022, and includes a new 15% minimum tax on “adjusted financial statement income” beginning with the Company’s fiscal year 2024, and a new 1% excise tax on stock repurchases after December 31, 2022. While these tax law changes have no immediate effect and are not expected to have a material impact on our future financial results, we will continue to evaluate its impact as further information becomes available. 29 Table of Contents Segment Information Results of operations by segment (in millions) : North America Fiscal Year Ended Oct 2, 2022 Oct 3, 2021 Oct 2, 2022 Oct 3, 2021 As a % of North America Total Net Revenues Net revenues: Company-operated stores $ 21,214.2 $ 18,737.3 90.8 % 91.6 % Licensed stores 2,150.5 1,702.2 9.2 8.3 Other 6.1 8.4 0.0 0.0 Total net revenues 23,370.8 20,447.9 100.0 100.0 Product and distribution costs 6,677.2 5,453.8 28.6 26.7 Store operating expenses 10,860.0 9,359.5 46.5 45.8 Other operating expenses 202.1 166.0 0.9 0.8 Depreciation and amortization expenses 808.4 753.9 3.5 3.7 General and administrative expenses 303.3 300.0 1.3 1.5 Restructuring and impairments 33.3 155.4 0.1 0.8 Total operating expenses 18,884.3 16,188.6 80.8 79.2 Operating income $ 4,486.5 $ 4,259.3 19.2 % 20.8 % Revenues North America total net revenues for fiscal 2022 increased $2.9 billion, or 14%, primarily due to a 12% increase in comparable store sales ($2.2 billion) driven by a 7% increase in average ticket and a 5% increase in transaction. Also contributing to these increases were the performance of net new company-operated store openings over the past 12 months ($628 million) and higher product and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($487 million), primarily due to business recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2021 ($427 million). Operating Margin North America operating income for fiscal 2022 increased 5% to $4.5 billion, compared to $4.3 billion in fiscal 2021. Operating margin decreased 160 basis points to 19.2%, primarily due to investments and growth in labor, including enhanced retail store partner wages (approximately 350 basis points) as well as increased spend on new partner training and support costs (approximately 120 basis points). Also contributing were inflationary pressures on commodities and our supply chain (approximately 350 basis points). These were partially offset by strategic pricing (approximately 400 basis points) and sales leverage. 30 Table of Contents International Fiscal Year Ended Oct 2, 2022 Oct 3, 2021 Oct 2, 2022 Oct 3, 2021 As a % of International Total Net Revenues Net revenues: Company-operated stores $ 5,361.9 $ 5,869.7 77.3 % 84.8 % Licensed stores 1,505.0 981.4 21.7 14.2 Other 73.2 70.5 1.1 1.0 Total net revenues 6,940.1 6,921.6 100.0 100.0 Product and distribution costs 2,357.7 2,187.3 34.0 31.6 Store operating expenses 2,701.8 2,571.4 38.9 37.2 Other operating expenses 191.4 147.3 2.8 2.1 Depreciation and amortization expenses 513.0 544.7 7.4 7.9 General and administrative expenses 345.3 360.5 5.0 5.2 Total operating expenses 6,109.2 5,811.2 88.0 84.0 Income from equity investees 2.3 135.3 0.0 2.0 Operating income $ 833.2 $ 1,245.7 12.0 % 18.0 % Revenues International total net revenues for fiscal 2022 increased $19 million, or 0.3%, primarily due to higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($435 million), mainly due to continuing business improvement from the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, there were 765 net new Starbucks company-operated stores, or a 11% increase over the past 12 months ($406 million). Also contributing to the increase was the conversion of our Korea market from a joint venture to a fully licensed market in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 ($187 million). These were partially offset by a 9% decline in comparable store sales ($459 million), driven by a 5% decrease in customer transactions and a 4% decrease in average ticket, primarily attributable to COVID-19 related restrictions in China and lapping the prior-year value-added-tax benefit in China, unfavorable foreign currency translation ($436 million) and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2021 ($127 million). Operating Margin International operating income for fiscal 2022 decreased 33% to $833.2 million, compared to $1.2 billion in fiscal 2021. Operating margin decreased 600 basis points to 12.0%, primarily due to sales deleverage related to COVID-19 pandemic impacts in our China market (approximately 460 basis points), investments and growth in retail store partner wages and benefits (approximately 140 basis points), lower temporary government subsidies (approximately 100 basis points), higher commodity and supply chain costs due to inflationary pressures (approximately 90 basis points) and strategic initiatives (approximately 90 basis points). These decreases were partially offset by sales leverage across markets outside of China. 31 Table of Contents Channel Development Fiscal Year Ended Oct 2, 2022 Oct 3, 2021 Oct 2, 2022 Oct 3, 2021 As a % of Channel Development Total Net Revenues Net revenues $ 1,843.6 $ 1,593.6 Product and distribution costs 1,194.2 1,011.2 64.8 % 63.5 % Other operating expenses 51.6 31.3 2.8 2.0 Depreciation and amortization expenses 0.1 1.2 0.0 0.1 General and administrative expenses 12.2 10.8 0.7 0.7 Total operating expenses 1,258.1 1,054.5 68.2 66.2 Income from equity investees 231.8 250.0 12.6 15.7 Operating income $ 817.3 $ 789.1 44.3 % 49.5 % Revenues Channel Development total net revenues for fiscal 2022 increased $250 million, or 16%, compared to fiscal 2021, primarily due to higher Global Coffee Alliance product sales and royalty revenue ($216 million) and growth in our ready-to-drink business ($44 million). These increases were partially offset by the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2021 ($21 million). Operating Margin Channel Development operating income for fiscal 2022 increased 4% to $817 million, compared to $789 million in fiscal 2021. Operating margin decreased 520 basis points to 44.3%, primarily due to a decline in our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture income due to inflationary pressures and supply chain constraints (approximately 340 basis points) and business mix shift (approximately 170 basis points). 32 Table of Contents Corporate and Other Fiscal Year Ended Oct 2, 2022 Oct 3, 2021 % Change Net revenues: Other $ 95.8 $ 97.5 (1.7) % Total net revenues 95.8 97.5 (1.7) Product and distribution costs 88.3 86.4 2.2 Other operating expenses 16.4 14.9 10.1 Depreciation and amortization expenses 126.4 141.9 (10.9) General and administrative expenses 1,371.2 1,261.3 8.7 Restructuring and impairments 12.7 15.0 (15.3) Total operating expenses 1,615.0 1,519.5 6.3 Operating loss $ (1,519.2) $ (1,422.0) 6.8 % Corporate and Other primarily consists of our unallocated corporate expenses and Evolution Fresh. Unallocated corporate expenses include corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we sold our Evolution Fresh brand and business. Corporate and Other operating loss increased to $1.5 billion for fiscal 2022, or 7%, compared to $1.4 billion in fiscal 2021. This increase was primarily driven by incremental investments in technology ($84 million), increased support costs to address labor market conditions ($36 million) and increased partner wages and benefits ($31 million). These increases were partially offset by lower performance-based compensation ($62 million). FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash and Investment Overview Our cash and investments were $3.5 billion and $6.9 billion as of October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021, respectively. We actively manage our cash and investments in order to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, make acquisitions and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases. Our investment portfolio primarily includes highly liquid available-for-sale securities, including corporate debt securities, government treasury securities (domestic and foreign) and commercial paper as well as principal-protected structured deposits. As of October 2, 2022, approximately $2.7 billion of cash and short-term investments were held in foreign subsidiaries. Borrowing capacity Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Our total contractual borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes was $2.8 billion as of the end of fiscal 2022. Revolving Lines of Credit Our $3.0 billion unsecured 5-year revolving credit facility (the “2021 credit facility”), of which $150 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit, is currently set to mature on September 16, 2026. The 2021 credit facility is available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases. We have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $1.0 billion. Borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR, and, for U.S. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on the Company’s long-term credit ratings assigned by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s rating agencies. The 2021 credit facility contains alternative interest rate provisions specifying rate calculations to be used at such time LIBOR ceases to be available as a benchmark due to reference rate reform. The “Base Rate” of interest is the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.500%, (ii) Bank of America’s prime rate, and (iii) the Eurocurrency Rate (as defined in the credit facility) plus 1.000%. As of October 2, 2022, we had no borrowings under the 2021 credit facility. Commercial Paper Under our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion, with individual maturities that may vary but not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. Amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program are required to be backstopped by available commitments under the 33 Table of Contents 2021 credit facility discussed above. The proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper program may be used for working capital needs, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, business expansion, payment of cash dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. As of October 2, 2022, we had $175.0 million outstanding under our commercial paper program. Credit Facilities in Japan Additionally, we hold Japanese yen-denominated credit facilities which are available for working capital needs and capital expenditures within our Japanese market. • A ¥5 billion, or $34.6 million, facility is currently set to mature on December 31, 2022. Borrowings under the credit facility are subject to terms defined within the facility and will bear interest at a variable rate based on TIBOR plus an applicable margin of 0.400%. • A ¥10 billion, or $69.2 million, facility is currently set to mature on March 27, 2023. Borrowings under the credit facility are subject to terms defined within the facility and will bear interest at a variable rate based on TIBOR plus 0.350%. As of October 2, 2022, we had no borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities. See Note 9 , Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for details of the components of our long-term debt. Our ability to incur new liens and conduct sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties is subject to compliance with terms of the indentures under which the long-term notes were issued. As of October 2, 2022, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. Use of Cash We expect to use our available cash and investments, including, but not limited to, additional potential future borrowings under the credit facilities, commercial paper program and the issuance of debt to support and invest in our core businesses, including investing in new ways to serve our customers and supporting our store partners, repaying maturing debts, as well as returning cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and discretionary share repurchases and investing in new business opportunities related to our core and developing businesses. Further, we may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our investees. We may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business. Acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our investees. Any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy. We believe that net future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and investments both domestically and internationally, combined with our ability to leverage our balance sheet through the issuance of debt, will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses as well as shareholder distributions for at least the next 12 months. We are currently not aware of any trends or demands, commitments, events or uncertainties that will result in, or that are reasonably likely to result in, our liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way that will impact our capital needs during or beyond the next 12 months. We regularly review our cash positions and our determination of partial indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings. In the event we determine that all or another portion of such foreign earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested, we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes, which could be material. We currently do not anticipate the need for repatriated funds to the U.S. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs. See Note 14 , Income Taxes, for further discussion. During each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2021, we declared a cash dividend to shareholders of $0.45 per share. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, and for each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2022, we declared a cash dividend of $0.49 per share. Dividends are generally paid in the quarter following the declaration date. Cash returned to shareholders through dividends in fiscal 2022 and 2021 totaled $2.3 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we declared a cash dividend of $0.53 per share to be paid on November 25, 2022, with an expected payout of approximately $608.3 million. During the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we resumed our share repurchase program which had been temporarily suspended in March 2020. During the fiscal year ended October 2, 2022, we repurchased 36.3 million shares of common stock for $4.0 billion on the open market. On March 15, 2022, we announced that our Board authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 40 million shares under our ongoing share repurchase program. On April 4, 2022, we announced a temporary suspension of our share repurchase program to allow us to augment investments in our stores and partners. Repurchases pursuant to this program were last made on April 1, 2022. As of October 2, 2022, 52.6 million shares remained available for repurchase under current authorizations. We have resumed our share repurchase program in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. 34 Table of Contents Other than operating expenses, cash requirements for fiscal 2023 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for investments in our new and existing stores, our supply chain and corporate facilities. Total capital expenditures for fiscal 2023 are expected to be approximately $2.5 billion. The following table summarizes current and long-term material cash requirements as of October 2, 2022, which we expect to fund primarily with operating cash flows ( in millions ): Material Cash Requirements Total Less than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years More than 5 Years Operating lease obligations (1) $ 9,863.7 $ 1,473.5 $ 2,729.2 $ 2,121.4 $ 3,539.6 Debt obligations Principal payments 15,038.4 1,000.0 3,088.4 1,000.0 9,950.0 Interest payments 6,499.8 487.3 865.2 725.3 4,422.0 Purchase obligations (2) 1,354.5 1,030.1 324.4 — — Other obligations (3) 401.6 125.0 118.7 84.6 73.3 Total $ 33,158.0 $ 4,115.9 $ 7,125.9 $ 3,931.3 $ 17,984.9 (1) Amounts include direct lease obligations, excluding any taxes, insurance and other related expenses. (2) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on Starbucks and that specify all significant terms. Green coffee purchase commitments comprise 99% of total purchase obligations. (3) Other obligations include other long-term liabilities primarily consisting of long-term income taxes payable, asset retirement obligations and equity investment capital commitments. Cash Flows Cash provided by operating activities was $4.4 billion for fiscal 2022, compared to $6.0 billion for fiscal 2021. The change was primarily due to lower net earnings and an increase in inventory purchases and timing of income tax payments. Cash used in investing activities totaled $2.1 billion for fiscal 2022, compared to $0.3 billion for fiscal 2021. The change was primarily driven by lapping the net proceeds from the divestiture of our ownership interest in our South Korea joint venture and an increase in spend on capital expenditures. Cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2022 totaled $5.6 billion, compared to cash provided by financing activities of $3.7 billion for fiscal 2021. The change was primarily due to resuming our share repurchase program, partially offset by net proceeds from issuance of long-term debt. COMMODITY PRICES, AVAILABILITY AND GENERAL RISK CONDITIONS Commodity price risk represents Starbucks primary market risk, generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products, among other items. We purchase, roast and sell high-quality arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. In addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our company-operated stores. The price and availability of these commodities directly impacts our results of operations, and we expect commodity prices, particularly coffee, to impact future results of operations. For additional details see Product Supply in Item 1 , as well as Risk Factors in Item 1A of this 10-K. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT Market risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity security prices and interest rates. We manage our exposure to various market-based risks according to a market price risk management policy. Under this policy, market-based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies, such as entering into hedging transactions. The market price risk management policy governs how hedging instruments may be used to mitigate risk. Risk limits are set annually and speculative trading activities are prohibited. We also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk, which we consider to be low. We use interest rate swap agreements and treasury locks to primarily hedge against changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances. We also use cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange debt instruments to hedge against changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt and foreign exchange exposure of net investments in Japan. Excluding interest rate hedging instruments, cross currency swaps and foreign currency debt, hedging instruments generally do not have maturities in excess of three years. Refer to Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, and Note 3 , Derivative Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion of our hedging instruments. 35 Table of Contents The sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited, point-in-time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed. The actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses. Commodity Price Risk We purchase commodity inputs, primarily coffee, dairy products, diesel, cocoa, sugar and other commodities, that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results. We use a combination of pricing features embedded within supply contracts, such as fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed contracts for coffee purchases, and financial derivatives to manage our commodity price risk exposure. The following table summarizes the potential impact as of October 2, 2022 to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income (“OCI”) from changes in commodity prices. The information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items (in millions) : Increase/(Decrease) to Net Earnings Increase/(Decrease) to OCI 10% Increase in Underlying Rate 10% Decrease in Underlying Rate 10% Increase in Underlying Rate 10% Decrease in Underlying Rate Commodity hedges $ 3.0 $ (3.0) $ 74 $ (74) Foreign Currency Exchange Risk The majority of our revenue, expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the U.S., we have transactions in other currencies, primarily the Chinese renminbi, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, British pound, South Korean won and euro. To reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations, we enter into derivative instruments to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated intercompany royalty payments, inventory purchases, intercompany borrowing and lending activities and certain other transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity that enters into the arrangements, as well as the translation risk of certain balance sheet items. The volatility in the foreign exchange market may lead to significant fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates and adversely impact our financial results in the case of weakening foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The following table summarizes the potential impact as of October 2, 2022 to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due to a change in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign exchange rates. The information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items ( in millions ): Increase/(Decrease) to Net Earnings Increase/(Decrease) to OCI 10% Increase in Underlying Rate 10% Decrease in Underlying Rate 10% Increase in Underlying Rate 10% Decrease in Underlying Rate Foreign currency hedges $ 46 $ (46) $ 155 $ (155) Equity Security Price Risk We have minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds and equity exchange-traded funds within our marketable equity securities portfolio. Marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value and approximates a portion of our liability under our Management Deferred Compensation Plan (“MDCP”). Gains and losses from the portfolio and the change in our MDCP liability are recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings. We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of October 2, 2022 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments. 36 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk Long-term Debt We utilize short-term and long-term financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage our overall interest expense related to our existing fixed-rate debt, as well as to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances. See Note 3 , Derivative Financial Instruments and Note 9 , Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion of our interest rate hedge agreements and details of the components of our long-term debt, respectively, as of October 2, 2022. The following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates as of October 2, 2022 on the fair value of Starbucks debt (in millions) : Change in Fair Value Fair Value 100 Basis Point Increase in Underlying Rate 100 Basis Point Decrease in Underlying Rate Long-term debt (1) $ 13,052 $ 1,100 $ (1,100) (1) Amount disclosed is net of $28 million change in the fair value of our designated interest rate swap. Refer to Note 3 , Derivative Financial Instruments, for additional information on our interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge. Available-for-Sale Debt Securities Our available-for-sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of investment-grade debt securities. The primary objective of these investments is to preserve capital and liquidity. Available-for-sale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. We do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our investments. We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our available-for-sale securities as of October 2, 2022 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Critical accounting estimates are those that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain, especially in light of the current economic environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Judgments and uncertainties may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Our significant accounting estimates are discussed in additional detail in Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. We consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. During the past five fiscal years, we have not made any material changes to the accounting methodologies used to assess the areas discussed below, unless noted otherwise. We believe that our significant accounting estimates involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity for the reasons discussed below: 37 Table of Contents Property, Plant and Equipment and Other Finite-Lived Assets We evaluate property, plant and equipment, operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and other finite-lived assets for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. When evaluating for impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis and is depreciated over the asset's remaining useful life. Long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For company-operated store assets, the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level, which is inclusive of property, plant and equipment and lease ROU assets. The fair value of a store’s assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. For other long-lived assets, fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances, which may include discounted cash flows, comparable transactions or comparable company analyses. Our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values. Key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values include projected revenue growth and operating expenses, as well as forecasting asset useful lives and selecting an appropriate discount rate. For company-operated stores, estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider the store’s historical performance, the local market economics and the business environment impacting the store’s performance. The discount rate is selected based on what we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store. The fair value of a store’s ROU asset is estimated considering what a market participant would pay to lease the asset for its highest and best use. These estimates are subjective and our ability to realize future cash flows and asset fair values is affected by factors such as ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets, changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance. In fiscal 2022, we announced our Reinvention Plan in the U.S. market to increase efficiency while elevating the partner and customer experience. As a result of the restructuring efforts in connection with the Reinvention Plan, we recorded an immaterial impairment charge on our consolidated statements of earnings during the fiscal year ended October 2, 2022. Future impairment charges attributed to our Reinvention Plan are not expected to be material. In fiscal 2021, we substantially completed our plan to reposition our North America store portfolio, primarily in dense metropolitan markets by pursuing strategic store closures and focusing on new store formats that better cater to changing customer tastes and preferences. During fiscal year 2021, we recorded approximately $155.4 million to restructuring and impairments on our consolidated statements of earnings. These totals included $53.1 million related to disposal and impairment of company-operated store assets and $89.5 million primarily associated with accelerated amortization of ROU lease assets and other lease costs due to store closures prior to the end of contractual lease terms. As this restructuring plan was substantially completed in fiscal 2021, we did not recognize any material restructuring and impairment amounts related to this plan during the fiscal year ended October 2, 2022. Asset impairment charges are discussed in Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets We evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate impairment may exist. When evaluating these assets for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit using discounted cash flows or a combination of discounted cash flow and market approaches. When assessing goodwill for impairment, our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment for an individual reporting unit is influenced by a number of factors, inclusive of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill, the significance of the excess of the reporting unit’s estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date, the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments and the date of acquisition. If we perform a quantitative assessment of an individual reporting unit’s goodwill, our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment when estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, including projected revenue growth and operating expenses related to existing businesses, product innovation and new store concepts, as well as utilizing valuation multiples of similar publicly traded companies and selecting an appropriate discount rate. Estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering the reporting unit’s past performance 38 Table of Contents and forecasted growth, including assumptions regarding business recovery post COVID-19, strategic initiatives, local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit’s performance. The discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital for a market participant to operate the reporting unit in the region. These estimates, as well as the selection of comparable companies and valuation multiples used in the market approaches are highly subjective, and our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion. Our goodwill impairment assessments were not significantly altered as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to believe the fair value of each of our reporting units is significantly in excess of its carrying value, and absent a sustained multi-year global decline in our business in key markets such as the U.S. and China, we do not anticipate incurring significant goodwill impairment in the next 12 months. Our fiscal 2022 annual goodwill impairment testing, which was completed in the third fiscal quarter, resulted in an estimated fair value of our reporting units where a quantitative assessment was performed, was in excess of carrying value of approximately $95 billion for the business units where a quantitative analysis on impairment was performed. When assessing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, where we perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate if changes in events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that impairment may exist. If we do not perform a qualitative impairment assessment or if changes in events and circumstances indicate that a quantitative assessment should be performed, management is required to calculate the fair value of the intangible asset group. The fair value calculation includes estimates of revenue growth, which are based on past performance and internal projections for the intangible asset group’s forecasted growth, including assumptions regarding business recovery post COVID-19, and royalty rates, which are adjusted for our particular facts and circumstances. The discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital that reflects the risk profile of the related business. These estimates are highly subjective, and our ability to achieve the forecasted cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion. We do not anticipate recording significant impairment charges in the next 12 months. Definite-lived intangible asset impairment charges are discussed in Note 8 , Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. Income Taxes We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. We routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and results of operations. In projecting future taxable income, we consider historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal and foreign pre-tax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. Our assumptions regarding future taxable income are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income/(loss). In addition, our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include review of our tax filing positions, such as the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions. We evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of our position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. For uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold, we record a related liability. We adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available. As discussed in Note 14 , Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, we do not expect a significant amount of the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits to be recognized by the end of fiscal 2023 for reasons such as a lapse of the statute of limitations or resolution of examinations with tax authorities . We have generated income in certain foreign jurisdictions that may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes. We regularly review our plans for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings. The possibility exists that foreign earnings declared as indefinitely reinvested may be repatriated as our plans are based on our estimated working and other capital needs in jurisdictions where our earnings are generated. While we do not expect to 39 Table of Contents repatriate cash to the U.S. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs, if these amounts were distributed to the U.S., in the form of dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes, which could be material. Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. Deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation, the status of various income tax audits and our particular facts and circumstances. Although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results, including forecasted business performance, could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Fiscal Years ended October 2, 2022, October 3, 2021 and September 27, 2020 Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates Description of Business We purchase and roast high-quality coffees that we sell, along with handcrafted coffee and tea beverages and a variety of fresh and prepared food items, through our company-operated stores. We also sell a variety of coffee and tea products and license our trademarks through other channels such as licensed stores, grocery and foodservice. The grocery and foodservice business is primarily through our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestlé established in August 2018. In this 10-K, Starbucks Corporation (together with its subsidiaries) is referred to as “Starbucks,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our.” Segment information is prepared on the same basis that our management reviews financial information for operational decision-making purposes. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, certain changes were made to our management team, and our operating segment reporting structure was realigned as a result. We realigned our fully licensed Latin America and Caribbean markets from our Americas operating segment to our International operating segment. We renamed the Americas operating segment to the North America operating segment, since it is comprised of our company-operated and licensed stores in the U.S. and Canada. We also made certain other immaterial changes between our International operating segment and Corporate and Other. Certain prior period information for our North America and International operating segments and our Corporate and Other reportable segment has been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. There was no impact on consolidated net revenues, total operating expenses, operating income or net earnings per share as a result of these changes. We have three reportable operating segments: 1) North America, which is inclusive of the U.S. and Canada; 2) International, which is inclusive of China, Japan, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East and Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean; and 3) Channel Development. Non-reportable operating segments and unallocated corporate expenses are reported within Corporate and Other. Additional details on the nature of our business and our reportable operating segments are included in Note 17 , Segment Reporting. Certain prior period information on the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation. Principles of Consolidation Our consolidated financial statements reflect the financial position and operating results of Starbucks, including wholly-owned subsidiaries and investees that we control. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Fiscal Year End Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. Fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 included 52, 53 and 52 weeks, respectively. The 53rd week in fiscal 2021 fell in the fourth fiscal quarter. Estimates and Assumptions Preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Examples include, but are not limited to, estimates for inventory reserves, asset and goodwill impairments, assumptions underlying self-insurance reserves, income from unredeemed stored value cards, stock-based compensation forfeiture rates, future asset retirement obligations and the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements. Actual results and outcomes may differ from these estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties, including uncertainty in the current economic environment due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. Restructuring In fiscal 2022, we announced our plan in the U.S. market to increase efficiency while elevating the partner and customer experience (the “Reinvention Plan”). We believe the investments in partner wages and trainings will increase retention and productivity while the acceleration of purpose-built store concepts and innovations in technologies will provide additional convenience and connection with our customers. As a result of the restructuring efforts in connection with the Reinvention Plan, we recorded $ 46.0 million to restructuring and impairments on our consolidated statements of earnings. Future restructuring and impairment costs attributable to our Reinvention Plan are not expected to be material. 47 Table of Contents In fiscal 2021, we substantially completed our plan to reposition our North America store portfolio, primarily in dense metropolitan markets by pursuing strategic store closures and focusing on new store formats that better cater to changing customer tastes and preferences. During fiscal years 2021 and 2020, we recorded approximately $ 155.4 million and $ 254.7 million, respectively, to restructuring and impairments on our consolidated statements of earnings. These totals included $ 53.1 million and $ 151.0 million, respectively, related to disposal and impairment of company-operated store assets and $ 89.5 million and $ 87.7 million, respectively, primarily associated with accelerated amortization of ROU lease assets and other lease costs due to store closures prior to the end of contractual lease terms. As this restructuring plan was substantially completed in fiscal 2021, we did not recognize any material restructuring and impairment amounts related to this plan during the fiscal year ended October 2, 2022. As of October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021, there were no material restructuring-related accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Cash and Cash Equivalents We consider all highly liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase, as well as credit card receivables for sales to customers in our company-operated stores that generally settle within two to five business days, to be cash equivalents. We maintain cash and cash equivalent balances with financial institutions that exceed federally-insured limits. We have not experienced any losses related to these balances, and we believe credit risk to be minimal. Our cash management system provides for the funding of all major bank disbursement accounts on a daily basis as checks are presented for payment. Under this system, outstanding checks are in excess of the cash balances at certain banks, which creates book overdrafts. Book overdrafts are presented as a current liability in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Investments Available-for-sale Debt Securities Our short-term and long-term investments include investment-grade debt securities, all of which are classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair value, and unrealized holding gains and losses are recorded, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Available-for-sale securities with remaining maturities of less than one year and those identified by management at the time of purchase to be used to fund operations within one year are classified as short-term. All other available-for-sale securities are classified as long-term. We evaluate our available-for-sale securities for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. Unrealized losses are charged against net earnings when a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary. We review several factors to determine whether a loss is other than temporary, such as the length and extent of the fair value decline, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and whether we have the intent to sell or will more likely than not be required to sell before the securities' anticipated recovery, which may be at maturity. Realized gains and losses are accounted for using the specific identification method. Purchases and sales are recorded on a trade date basis. Structured Deposits We hold short-term, principal-protected structured deposits that provide returns in the form of both fixed and variable yields; such variable yields are indexed to foreign exchange rates, equity-linked instruments or interest rate indices. The Company has elected to account for these using the fair value option with gains and losses recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings. For fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, resulting gains and losses were immaterial to our consolidated statements of earnings. Marketable Equity Securities We also have a marketable equity securities portfolio, which is comprised of marketable equity mutual funds and equity exchange-traded funds. Marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value and approximates a portion of our liability under our Management Deferred Compensation Plan (“MDCP”). Gains or losses from the portfolio and the change in our MDCP liability are recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings. Equity Investments Equity investments are accounted for under the equity method if we are able to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. Our share of the earnings or losses as reported by the investees is classified as income from equity investees on our consolidated statements of earnings. The investments are evaluated for impairment annually and when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. We account for equity investments for which we do not have significant influence and without readily determinable fair values at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments as permitted by the measurement alternative. Investments for which the measurement alternative has been elected are assessed for impairment quarterly, or if a triggering 48 Table of Contents event indicates impairment may be present. Any adjustments as a result of price changes or impairments are recorded in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. Fair Value Fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability (exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants. For assets and liabilities recorded or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis, we determine fair value based on the following: Level 1: The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. For equity and U.S. government treasury securities and commodity futures contracts, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets to determine fair value. Level 2: When quoted prices in active markets for identical assets are not available, we determine the fair value of certain assets based upon factors such as the quoted market price of similar assets or a discounted cash flow model using readily observable market data, which may include interest rate curves and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities, depending on the nature of the investment. The fair value of our long-term debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates offered to us for debt of the same remaining maturities. Level 3: We determine the fair value of our auction rate securities using an internally-developed valuation model, using inputs that include interest rate curves, credit and liquidity spreads and effective maturity. Assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis may include items such as property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, equity and other investments and other assets. We determine the fair value of these items using Level 3 inputs, as described in the related sections below. Derivative Instruments We manage our exposure to various risks within our consolidated financial statements according to a market price risk management policy. Under this policy, we may engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments to hedge interest rates, commodity prices and foreign currency-denominated revenue streams, inventory purchases, assets and liabilities and investments in certain foreign operations. In order to manage our exposure to these risks, we use various types of derivative instruments including forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, collars and swaps. Forward contracts and commodity futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a predetermined future date and at a predetermined rate or price. A collar is a strategy that uses a combination of a purchased call option and a sold put option with equal premiums to hedge a portion of anticipated cash flows, or to limit possible gains or losses on an underlying asset or liability to a specific range. A swap agreement is a contract between two parties to exchange cash flows based on specified underlying notional amounts, assets and/or indices. We do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes. We record all derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value and typically do not offset derivative assets and liabilities. Excluding interest rate hedging instruments, cross-currency swaps and foreign currency debt hedging instruments, we generally do not enter into derivative instruments with maturities longer than three years. However, we are allowed to net settle transactions with respective counterparties for certain derivative contracts, inclusive of interest rate swaps and foreign currency forwards, with a single, net amount payable by one party to the other. We also enter into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. As of October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021, cash collateral held under collateral security arrangements was $ 74.3 million and $ 44.7 million, respectively, and is included in other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. As of October 2, 2022, cash collateral pledged as part of our commodity derivative margin requirements was $ 75.6 million and is included in prepaid expenses and other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets. As of October 3, 2021, cash collateral pledged as part of our commodity derivative margin requirements was $ 72.5 million and is included in cash and cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheets. The potential effects of netting arrangements with our derivative contracts, excluding the effects of collateral, would not have had a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets. By using these derivative instruments, we expose ourselves to potential credit risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. We minimize this credit risk by entering into transactions with carefully selected, credit-worthy counterparties and distribute contracts among several financial institutions to reduce the concentration of credit risk. Cash Flow Hedges For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the derivative's gain or loss is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) on our consolidated balance sheets. The gain or loss is subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged exposure affects net earnings, in the same line item as the underlying hedged item on our consolidated statements of earnings. 49 Table of Contents Cash flow hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the inception of each hedge. Cash flows from hedging transactions are classified in the same categories as the cash flows from the respective hedged items. For de-designated cash flow hedges in which the transactions are no longer likely to occur, the related accumulated derivative gains or losses are recognized in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings based on the nature of the underlying transaction. Net Investment Hedges For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a net investment hedge, the derivative's, or qualifying non-derivative instrument’s gain or loss is reported as a component of OCI and recorded in AOCI. The gain or loss will be subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. Fair Value Hedges For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the changes in fair value of the derivative instrument and the offsetting changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item due to changes in the hedged risk are recorded in interest income and other, net or interest expense on our consolidated statements of earnings. Derivatives Not Designated As Hedging Instruments We also enter into certain foreign currency forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, collars and swaps that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. The changes in the fair values of these contracts are immediately recognized in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. Normal Purchase Normal Sale We enter into fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed green coffee purchase commitments, which we expect to take delivery and to utilize in a reasonable period of time in the ordinary course of business. Since these types of purchase commitments qualify for the normal purchase normal sale exemption, they are not recorded as derivative instruments on our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 3 , Derivative Financial Instruments, and Note 5 , Inventories, for further discussion of our derivative instruments and green coffee purchase commitments. Receivables, net of Allowance for Credit Losses Our receivables are mainly comprised of receivables for product and equipment sales to and royalties from our licensees, as well as receivables from our Global Coffee Alliance and other Channel Development customers. The primary indicators of the credit quality of our receivables are aging, payment history, economic sector information and outside credit monitoring, and are assessed on a quarterly basis. Our credit loss exposure is mainly concentrated in our accounts receivable portfolio. Our allowance for credit losses is calculated using a loss-rate method based on historical experience, current market conditions and reasonable forecasts. We also assessed incremental risks due to COVID-19 on our licensees’ financial viability. For the fiscal year ended October 2, 2022, we did not observe a significant deterioration of our receivable portfolio that required a significant increase in our allowance for credit losses. As of October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021, our allowance for credit losses was $ 27.2 million and $ 25.6 million, respectively. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (primarily moving average cost) or net realizable value. We record inventory reserves for obsolete and slow-moving inventory and for estimated shrinkage between physical inventory counts. Inventory reserves are based on inventory obsolescence trends, historical experience and application of the specific identification method. As of October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021, inventory reserves were $ 43.1 million and $ 36.6 million, respectively. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes all direct costs necessary to acquire and prepare assets for use, including internal labor and overhead in some cases. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of the assets, generally ranging from 2 to 15 years for equipment and 30 to 40 years for buildings. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the related lease life, generally 10 years. For leases with renewal periods at our option, we generally use the original lease term, excluding renewal option periods, to determine estimated useful lives. If failure to exercise a renewal option imposes an economic penalty to us, we may determine at the inception of the lease that renewal is reasonably assured and include the renewal option period in the determination of the appropriate estimated useful lives. The portion of depreciation expense related to production and distribution facilities is included in product and distribution costs on our consolidated statements of earnings. The costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed when incurred, while expenditures for refurbishments and improvements that significantly add to the productive capacity or extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized. When assets are disposed of, whether through retirement or sale, the net gain or loss is recognized in 50 Table of Contents net earnings. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell. We evaluate property, plant and equipment for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. When evaluating for impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The fair value of the asset is estimated using a discounted cash flow model based on forecasted future revenues and operating costs, using internal projections. Property, plant and equipment assets and ROU assets related to the store lease are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For company-operated store assets, the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level. We recognized net disposition and impairment charges of $ 66.6 million, $ 153.1 million and $ 294.9 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Of the total net disposition and impairment charges, $ 9.6 million, $ 53.1 million and $ 151.0 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, were restructuring related and recorded in restructuring and impairment expenses. For fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, we evaluated COVID-19 business recovery trends and their estimated impacts on future revenue growth and profitability for assessing impairment of our company-operated retail store and related operating lease ROU assets. As a result, we recorded $ 14.3 million, $ 44.4 million and $ 59.6 million of impairment losses within store operating expenses on our consolidated statements of earnings during the fiscal years ended October 2, 2022, October 3, 2021 and September 27, 2020, respectively. Unless it is restructuring related, the nature of the underlying asset that is impaired or disposed of will determine the operating expense line on which the related impact is recorded on our consolidated statements of earnings. Leases The majority of our leases are operating leases for our company-operated retail store locations. We also lease, among other things, roasting, distribution and warehouse facilities and office space for corporate administrative purposes. We categorize leases as either operating or finance leases at the commencement date of the lease. Operating lease agreements may contain tenant improvement allowances, rent holidays, rent escalation clauses and/or contingent rent provisions. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for together as a single lease component for all underlying classes of assets. We recognize a ROU asset and lease liability for each operating and finance lease with a contractual term greater than 12 months at the time of lease inception. We do not record leases with an initial term of 12 months or less on our consolidated balance sheet but continue to record rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We review contracts for identified assets where we have the right to direct the use of the asset and record those agreements as embedded leases on our consolidated balance sheet. Our leases often include options to extend or terminate at our sole discretion, which are included in the determination of lease term when they are reasonably certain to be exercised. Our lease liability represents the present value of future lease payments over the lease term. Given our policy election to combine lease and non-lease components, we also consider fixed common area maintenance (“CAM”) part of our fixed future lease payments; therefore, fixed CAM is also included in our lease liability. We cannot determine the interest rate implicit in each of our leases. Therefore, we use market and term-specific incremental borrowing rates. Our incremental borrowing rate for a lease is the rate of interest we expect to pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments under similar terms. Because we do not borrow on a collateralized basis, we consider a combination of factors, including our credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate, the risk profile and funding cost of the specific geographic market of the lease, the lease term and the effect of adjusting the rate to reflect consideration of collateral. Our credit-adjusted risk-free rate takes into consideration interest rates we pay on our unsecured long-term bonds as well as quoted interest rates obtained from financial institutions. Total lease costs recorded as rent and other occupancy costs include fixed operating lease costs, variable lease costs and short-term lease costs. Most of our real estate leases require we pay certain expenses, such as CAM costs, real estate taxes and other executory costs, of which the fixed portion is included in operating lease costs. We recognize operating lease costs on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In addition to the above costs, variable lease costs also include amounts based on a percentage of gross sales in excess of specified levels and are recognized when probable and are not included in determining the present value of our lease liability. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. A significant majority of our leases are related to our company-operated stores, and their related costs are recorded within store operating expenses. The ROU asset is measured at the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, initial direct costs and any tenant improvement allowances received. For operating leases, ROU assets are reduced over the lease term by the recognized straight-line lease expense less the amount of accretion of the lease liability 51 Table of Contents determined using the effective interest method. For finance leases, ROU assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the leased asset or the lease term. Interest expense on each finance lease liability is recognized utilizing the effective interest method. ROU assets are tested for impairment in the same manner as long-lived assets. Additionally, we monitor for events or changes in circumstances that may require a reassessment of one of our leases and determine if a remeasurement is required. During fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021, the COVID-19-related rent concessions we received for stores, primarily in our International segment, were immaterial. During fiscal 2020, we received $ 27.6 million of COVID-19-related rent concessions for stores in our International segment generally correlating with the temporary period our stores were closed. Consistent with updated guidance from the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) in April 2020, we elected to treat COVID-19-related rent concessions as variable rent. Rent concessions were recognized as an offset to our rent expense within store operating expenses on our consolidated statement of earnings. See Note 10 , Leases, for additional details. Additionally, for the fiscal years ended October 3, 2021 and September 27, 2020, we recognized accelerated amortization of ROU lease assets and other lease costs of $ 89.5 million and $ 87.7 million, respectively, due to planned store closures prior to the end of contractual lease terms, which were recorded in restructuring and impairments on the consolidated statement of earnings. In fiscal 2021, we substantially completed our plan to optimize our North America store portfolio and we did not recognize any material restructuring and impairment amounts related to this plan during the fiscal year ended October 2, 2022. Goodwill We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change, such as material deterioration in performance or a significant number of store closures, that would indicate that impairment may exist. When evaluating goodwill for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. Fair value is typically calculated using a discounted cash flow model. For certain reporting units, where deemed appropriate, we may also utilize a market approach for estimating fair value. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value. As part of our ongoing operations, we may close certain stores within a reporting unit containing goodwill due to underperformance of the store or inability to renew our lease, among other reasons. We may abandon certain assets associated with a closed store, including leasehold improvements and other non-transferable assets. When a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business is to be disposed of, goodwill associated with the business is included in the carrying amount of the business in determining any loss on disposal. Our evaluation of whether the portion of a reporting unit being disposed of constitutes a business occurs on the date of abandonment. Although an operating store meets the accounting definition of a business prior to abandonment, it does not constitute a business on the closure date because the remaining assets on that date do not constitute an integrated set of activities (substantive processes) and assets that are capable of being managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. As a result, when closing individual stores, we do not include goodwill in the calculation of any loss on disposal of the related assets. We recorded no goodwill impairment during fiscal 2022, fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020. See Note 8 , Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill, for further information. Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets include finite-lived intangible assets, which mainly consist of acquired and reacquired rights, trade secrets, licensing agreements, contract-based patents and copyrights. These assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment using a similar methodology to our property, plant and equipment, as described above. Indefinite-lived intangibles, which consist primarily of trade names and trademarks, are tested for impairment annually during the third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that impairment may exist. When evaluating other intangible assets for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an intangible asset group is impaired. If we do not perform the qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset group exceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset group. Fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the intangible asset group and is typically calculated using an income approach, such as a relief-from-royalty model. If the carrying amount of the intangible asset group exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value. In addition, we continuously monitor and may revise our intangible asset useful lives if and when facts and circumstances change. 52 Table of Contents There were no significant other intangible asset impairment charges recorded during fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021. We recorded other intangible asset impairment charges of $ 22.1 million during fiscal 2020. See Note 8 , Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill, for further information. Insurance Reserves We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance treaty, to provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks, including workers’ compensation, healthcare benefits, general liability, property insurance and director and officers’ liability insurance. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by us are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographics, exposure and severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Revenue Recognition Consolidated revenues are presented net of intercompany eliminations for wholly-owned subsidiaries and investees controlled by us and for product sales to and royalty and other fees from licensees accounted for under the equity method. Additionally, consolidated revenues are recognized net of any discounts, returns, allowances and sales incentives, including coupon redemptions and rebates. Company-operated Store Revenues Company-operated store revenues are recognized when payment is tendered at the point-of-sale as the performance obligation has been satisfied. For products sold via delivery platforms, revenues are also recognized when control of products are transferred to the customers. Delivery service fees are immaterial in the periods presented. Company-operated store revenues are reported excluding sales, use or other transaction taxes that are collected from customers and remitted to taxing authorities. Licensed Store Revenues Licensed store revenues consist of product and equipment sales, royalties and other fees paid by licensees using the Starbucks brand. Sales of coffee, tea, food and related products are generally recognized upon shipment to licensees, depending on contract terms. Shipping charges billed to licensees are also recognized as revenue, and the related shipping costs are included in product and distribution costs on our consolidated statements of earnings. We consider pre-opening services, including site evaluation and selection, store architectural/design and development and operational training, to be performance obligations that are separate from the license to operate under the Starbucks brand. These services provide distinct value to our licensees, including business and industry insight and knowledge that transfers value apart from the license. Revenues associated with pre-opening services are recognized upon completion of the related performance obligations, generally when a store is opened. Royalty revenues are recognized based upon a percentage of reported sales, and other continuing fees, such as marketing and service fees, are recognized as the performance obligations are met. Stored Value Cards Stored value cards can be activated through various channels, including at our company-operated and most licensed store locations, online at Starbucks.com or via mobile devices held by our customers and at certain other third-party websites and locations, such as grocery stores, although they cannot be reloaded at these third-party websites or locations. Amounts loaded onto stored value cards are initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue upon redemption. Historically, the majority of stored value cards are redeemed within one year. In many of our company-owned markets, including the U.S., our stored value cards do not have an expiration date nor do we charge service fees that cause a decrement to customer balances. Based on historical redemption rates, a portion of stored value cards is not expected to be redeemed and will be recognized as breakage over time in proportion to stored value card redemptions. The redemption rates are based on historical redemption patterns for each market, including the timing and business channel in which the card was activated or reloaded, and remittance to government agencies under unclaimed property laws, if applicable. Breakage is recognized as company-operated stores and licensed stores revenue within the consolidated statement of earnings. For the fiscal years ended October 2, 2022, October 3, 2021 and September 27, 2020, we recognized breakage revenue of $ 196.0 million, $ 164.5 million and $ 130.3 million in company-operated store revenues, respectively, and $ 16.7 million, $ 16.6 million and $ 14.3 million in licensed store revenues, respectively. 53 Table of Contents Loyalty Program Customers in the U.S., Canada and certain other countries who register their Starbucks Card are automatically enrolled in the Starbucks Rewards program, which is primarily a spend-based loyalty program. They earn loyalty points (“Stars”) in a variety of ways, including with each purchase at participating Starbucks stores and when making purchases with the Starbucks-branded credit cards. Starbucks Rewards members can earn Stars by paying with cash, credit or debit cards, or selected mobile wallets at company-operated stores in the U.S. and Canada. After accumulating a certain number of Stars, the customer earns a reward that can be redeemed for free product that, regardless of where the related Stars were earned within that country, will be honored at company-operated stores and certain participating licensed store locations in that same country. We defer revenue associated with the estimated selling price of Stars earned by Starbucks Rewards members towards free product as each Star is earned and a corresponding liability is established in deferred revenue. This deferral is based on the estimated value of the product for which the reward is expected to be redeemed, net of estimated unredeemed Stars. Stars generally expire after six months. When a customer redeems an earned reward, we recognize revenue for the redeemed product and reduce the related deferred revenue. Other Revenues Other revenues primarily include royalty revenues, sales of packaged coffee, tea and a variety of ready-to-drink beverages and single-serve coffee and tea products to customers outside of our company-operated and licensed stores. Sales of these products are generally recognized upon shipment to customers, depending on contract terms. Other revenues also include product sales to and licensing revenue from Nestlé related to our Global Coffee Alliance. Product sales to Nestlé are generally recognized when the product is shipped whereas royalty revenues are recognized based on a percentage of reported sales. Deferred Revenues Our deferred revenue primarily consists of the up-front prepaid royalty from Nestlé, for which we have continuing performance obligations to support the Global Coffee Alliance, and our unredeemed stored value card liability and unredeemed Stars associated with our loyalty program. See Note 11 , Deferred Revenue, for further information. Disaggregation of Revenues Revenues disaggregated by segment, product type and geographic area are disclosed in Note 17 , Segment Reporting. Product and Distribution Costs Product and distribution costs primarily consist of raw materials, purchased goods and packaging costs as well as operational costs of our supply chain organization, such as wages and benefits, occupancy costs and depreciation expenses, in support of sourcing, procuring, manufacturing, warehousing and transportation activities of products sold at our company-operated and licensed stores as well as through Channel Development and our other businesses. Also included are inventory and supply chain asset impairment costs. Store Operating Expenses Store operating expenses consist of costs incurred in our company-operated stores, primarily wages and benefits related to store partners (employees), occupancy costs and other costs that directly support the operation and sales-related activities of those stores. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses primarily consist of wages and benefits, professional service fees and occupancy costs for corporate headquarters and regional offices that support our corporate functions, including technology, finance, legal and partner resources . Advertising We expense most advertising costs as they are incurred, except for certain production costs that are expensed the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expenses totaled $ 416.7 million, $ 305.1 million and $ 258.8 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 54 Table of Contents Government Subsidies On March 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”), which among other things, provides employer payroll tax credits for wages paid to employees who are unable to work during the COVID-19 pandemic and options to defer payroll tax payments for a limited period. Based on our evaluation of the CARES Act, we qualify for certain employer payroll tax credits as well as the deferral of payroll tax payments in the future. Additionally, the Canadian government enacted the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (“CEWS”) to help employers offset a portion of their employee wages for a limited period. We elected to treat qualified government subsidies from the U.S., Canada and other governments as offsets to the related operating expenses. The CARES Act and CEWS were no longer applicable to us in late fiscal 2021. The qualified payroll credits reduced our store operating expenses by $ 210.0 million and $ 349.6 million on our consolidated statement of earnings during fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. After netting the qualified credits against our payable, a receivable balance of $ 69.4 million and $ 172.4 million was included in prepaid expenses and other current assets as of October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021, respectively. As of October 2, 2022, deferred payroll tax payments of $ 116.5 million were included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. As of October 3, 2021, deferred payroll tax payments of $ 116.4 million were included in both accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets. Store Preopening Expenses Costs incurred in connection with the start-up and promotion of new company-operated store openings are expensed as incurred. Asset Retirement Obligations We recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations (“ARO”) when such obligations are incurred. Our AROs are primarily associated with leasehold improvements, which, at the end of a lease, we are contractually obligated to remove in order to comply with the lease agreement. At the inception of a lease with such conditions, we record an ARO liability and a corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation. We estimate the liability using a number of assumptions, including store closing costs, cost inflation rates and discount rates, and accrete the liability to its projected future value over time. The capitalized asset is depreciated using the same depreciation convention as leasehold improvement assets. Upon satisfaction of the ARO conditions, any difference between the recorded ARO liability and the actual retirement costs incurred is recognized as a gain or loss in store operating expense on our consolidated statements of earnings. As of October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021, our net ARO assets included in property, plant and equipment were $ 26.1 million and $ 30.9 million, respectively, and our net ARO liabilities included in other long-term liabilities were $ 104.7 million and $ 116.5 million, respectively. Stock-based Compensation We maintain several equity incentive plans under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) or stock appreciation rights to employees, non-employee directors and consultants; stock options have not been broadly used as part of our compensation strategy in recent years. We also have an employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”). RSUs issued by us are equivalent to nonvested shares under the applicable accounting guidance. We record stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of stock awards at the grant date and recognize the expense over the related service period following a graded vesting expense schedule. Expense for performance-based RSUs is recognized when it is probable the performance goal will be achieved. Performance goals are determined by the Board and may include measures such as earnings per share, operating income, return on invested capital, total shareholder return and metrics focused on building inclusive and diverse teams. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model. The assumptions used to calculate the fair value of options granted are evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect market conditions and our historical experience. The fair value of RSUs is based on the closing price of Starbucks common stock on the award date, less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. If applicable, our total shareholder return relative to our peer group is incorporated into the underlying assumptions using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model to calculate grant date fair value. Compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award, and only for those awards expected to vest, with forfeitures estimated at the date of grant based on our historical experience and future expectations. Foreign Currency Translation Our international operations generally use their local currency as their functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Income and expense accounts are translated at the average monthly exchange rates during the year. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of OCI and recorded in AOCI on our consolidated balance sheets. 55 Table of Contents Income Taxes We compute income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred income taxes are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred taxes is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdictions from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and results of recent operations. If we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes. In addition, our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include review of our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions. We evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of our position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. For uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold, we record a related liability. We adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available. Starbucks recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense on our consolidated statements of earnings. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax balances on our consolidated balance sheets. Global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) provisions are applied, providing an incremental tax on foreign income. We have made a policy election to classify taxes due under the GILTI provision as a current period expense. Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock and the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period, calculated using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and RSUs. Performance-based RSUs are considered dilutive when the related performance criterion has been met. Common Stock Share Repurchases We may repurchase shares of Starbucks common stock under a program authorized by our Board, including pursuant to a contract, instruction or written plan meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the Exchange Act. Under applicable Washington State law, shares repurchased are retired and not displayed separately as treasury stock on the financial statements. Instead, the par value of repurchased shares is deducted from common stock and the excess repurchase price over par value is deducted from additional paid-in capital and from retained earnings (deficit). Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued guidance related to reference rate reform. The pronouncement provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the current guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burden related to the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. The guidance was effective upon issuance and generally can be applied to applicable contract modifications through December 31, 2022. The adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact to our financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance replacing the incurred loss impairment methodology with a new methodology that reflects current expected credit losses on financial assets, including receivables and available-for-sale securities. The new methodology requires entities to estimate and recognize expected credit losses each reporting period. The guidance was adopted during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 under the modified retrospective approach and resulted in a $ 2.2 million transition adjustment to opening shareholders’ retained deficit on our consolidated statements of equity. 56 Table of Contents Note 2: Acquisitions, Divestitures and Strategic Alliance Fiscal 2022 In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we sold our Evolution Fresh brand and business to Bolthouse Farms. This transaction did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Fiscal 2021 In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we sold our 50 % ownership interest in Starbucks Coffee Korea Co., Ltd. where our joint venture partner, E-Mart Inc., acquired an additional 17.5 % interest and Apfin Investment Pte Ltd, an affiliate of GIC Private Limited, which is a Singapore sovereign wealth fund, acquired the remaining 32.5 %. The sale had a combined price of $ 1.175 billion. This transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $ 864.5 million, which is included in net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations on our consolidated statements of earnings. Note 3: Derivative Financial Instruments Interest Rates From time to time, we enter into designated cash flow hedges to manage the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates. We enter into interest rate swap agreements, including forward-starting interest rate swaps and treasury locks, settled in cash based upon the difference between an agreed-upon benchmark rate and the prevailing benchmark rate at settlement. These agreements are generally settled around the time of the pricing of the related debt. Each derivative agreement's gain or loss is recorded in AOCI and is subsequently reclassified to interest expense over the life of the related debt. To hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap agreements, which are designated as fair value hedges. The changes in fair values of these derivative instruments and the offsetting changes in fair values of the underlying hedged debt due to changes in the relevant benchmark interest rates are recorded in interest expense. Refer to Note 9 , Debt, for additional information on our long-term debt. Foreign Currency To reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations, we enter into forward and swap contracts to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated intercompany royalty payments, inventory purchases and intercompany borrowing and lending activities. The resulting gains and losses from these derivatives are recorded in AOCI and subsequently reclassified to revenue, product and distribution costs, or interest income and other, net, respectively, when the hedged exposures affect net earnings. From time to time, we may enter into financial instruments, including, but not limited to, forward and swap contracts or foreign currency-denominated debt, to hedge the currency exposure of our net investments in certain international operations. The resulting gains and losses from these derivatives are recorded in AOCI and are subsequently reclassified to net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. Foreign currency forward and swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments are used to mitigate the foreign exchange risk of certain other balance sheet items. Gains and losses from these derivatives are largely offset by the financial impact of translating foreign currency-denominated payables and receivables; these gains and losses are recorded in interest income and other, net. Commodities Depending on market conditions, we may enter into coffee forward contracts, futures contracts and collars to hedge anticipated cash flows under our price-to-be-fixed green coffee contracts, which are described further in Note 5 , Inventories, or our longer-dated forecasted coffee demand where underlying fixed price and price-to-be-fixed contracts are not yet available. The resulting gains and losses are recorded in AOCI and are subsequently reclassified to product and distribution costs when the hedged exposure affects net earnings. Depending on market conditions, we may also enter into dairy forward contracts and futures contracts to hedge a portion of anticipated cash flows under our dairy purchase contracts and our forecasted dairy demand. The resulting gains or losses are recorded in AOCI and are subsequently reclassified to product and distribution costs when the hedged exposure affects net earnings. 57 Table of Contents Cash flow hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the inception of each hedge. Cash flows from hedging transactions are classified in the same categories as the cash flows from the respective hedged items. For de-designated cash flow hedges in which the underlying transactions are no longer probable of occurring, the related accumulated derivative gains or losses are recognized in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. Due to ongoing global supply chain disruptions, certain coffee cash flow hedges have been de-designated early which resulted in insignificant amounts recognized in earnings during the fiscal year ended October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021. These derivatives may be accounted for prospectively as non-designated derivatives until maturity, re-designated to new hedging relationships or terminated early. We continue to believe transactions related to our other designated cash flow hedges are probable to occur. To mitigate the price uncertainty of a portion of our future purchases, including diesel fuel and other commodities, we enter into swap contracts, futures and collars that are not designated as hedging instruments. The resulting gains and losses are recorded in interest income and other, net to help offset price fluctuations on our beverage, food, packaging and transportation costs, which are included in product and distribution costs on our consolidated statements of earnings.

Available-for-sale Debt Securities Long-term in vestments generally mature within 5 years . Proceeds from sales of securities were $ 72.6 million , $ 134.1 million and $ 177.4 million for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Realized gains and losses were not material f or fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020. Gross unrealized holding gains and losses were not material as of October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021. 62 Table of Contents Marketable Equity Securities Marketable equity securities include equity mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. Our marketable equity securities portfolio approximates a portion of our liability under our MDCP, a defined contribution plan. Our MDCP liability was $ 85.9 million and $ 105.2 million as of October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021, respectively. The changes in net unrealized holding gains and losses in the marketable equity securities portfolio included in earnings for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020 were not material. Gross unrealized holding gains and losses on marketable equity securities were not material a s of October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021. Derivative Assets and Liabilities Derivative assets and liabilities include foreign currency forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, collars and swaps, which are described further in Note 3 , Derivative Financial Instruments. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include items such as property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, equity and other investments and other assets. These assets are measured at fair value if determined to be impaired. Impairment of property, plant and equipment and ROU assets is included in Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates. We recognized impairments during fiscal years ended October 2, 2022, October 3, 2021 and September 27, 2020. Impairments recognized in fiscal years ended October 3, 2021 and September 27, 2020 were primarily related to our restructuring plan. See Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, Note 8 , Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill and Note 10 , Leases for additional discussion of these impairments. Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments The estimated fair value of our long-term debt based on the quoted market price (Level 2) is included at Note 9 , Debt. Note 5: Inventories (in millions) Oct 2, 2022 Oct 3, 2021 Coffee: Unroasted $ 1,018.6 $ 670.3 Roasted 310.3 233.5 Other merchandise held for sale 430.9 329.3 Packaging and other supplies 416.8 370.8 Total $ 2,176.6 $ 1,603.9 Other merchandise held for sale includes, among other items, serveware, food and tea. Inventory levels vary due to seasonality, commodity market supply and price fluctuations. As of October 2, 2022, we had committed to purchasing green coffee totaling $ 351 million under fixed-price contracts and an estimated $ 995 million under price-to-be-fixed contracts. A portion of our price-to-be-fixed contacts are effectively fixed through the use of futures. See Note 3 , Derivative Financial Instruments for further discussion. Price-to-be-fixed contracts are purchase commitments whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore the price, at which the base “C” coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established. For most contracts, either Starbucks or the seller has the option to “fix” the base “C” coffee commodity price prior to the delivery date. For other contracts, Starbucks and the seller may agree upon pricing parameters determined by the base “C” coffee commodity price. Until prices are fixed, we estimate the total cost of these purchase commitments. We believe, based on relationships established with our suppliers in the past and continuous monitoring of the business environment, the risk of non-delivery on these purchase commitments is remote. During the fiscal years ended October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021, we did not record significant write-offs related to the COVID-19 pandemic. During fiscal 2020, we wrote off approximately $ 50 million of inventory that was expiring or expected to expire due to COVID-19 pandemic related store closures, primarily perishable food and beverage ingredients located at our stores, distribution centers and suppliers. This was included in product and distribution costs on our consolidated statement of earnings. 63 Table of Contents Note 6: Equity Investments (in millions) Oct 2, 2022 Oct 3, 2021 Equity method investments $ 283.1 $ 216.0 Other investments 28.1 52.5 Total $ 311.2 $ 268.5 Equity Method Investments As of October 2, 2022, we had a 50 % ownership interest in Tata Starbucks Limited (India), which operates licensed Starbucks ® retail stores. Prior to its divestiture in September 2021, we had a 50 % ownership interest in Starbucks Coffee Korea Co., Ltd. Additional disclosure regarding changes in our equity method investments due to acquisition or divestiture is included in Note 2 , Acquisitions, Divestitures and Strategic Alliance. We also license the rights to produce and distribute Starbucks-branded products to our 50 % owned joint venture, The North American Coffee Partnership with the Pepsi-Cola Company, which develops and distributes bottled Starbucks ® beverages, including Frappuccino coffee drinks, Starbucks Doubleshot espresso drinks, Starbucks ® Iced Espresso Classics and Starbucks ® Iced Coffee. Our share of income and losses from our equity method investments is included in income from equity investees on our consolidated statements of earnings. Also included in this line item is our proportionate share of gross profit resulting from coffee and other product sales to, and royalty and license fee revenues generated from, equity investees. Revenues generated from these entities were $ 80.9 million, $ 160.8 million and $ 123.9 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Related product and distribution costs were $ 76.5 million, $ 92.1 million and $ 79.8 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021, there were $ 14.8 million and $ 7.9 million of accounts receivable from equity investees, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets, primarily related to product sales and royalty revenues. Additionally, we hold equity interests in other entities to support our corporate and investment strategies. The related financial statements activities were not material during the periods presented. Other Investments We have equity interests in entities that develop and operate Starbucks licensed stores in several global markets, as well as in companies that support our strategic initiatives. We do not have significant influence over these entities and their fair values are not readily determinable. Therefore, we elected to measure these investments at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairment. 64 Table of Contents Note 7: Supplemental Balance Sheet and Statement of Earnings Information (in millions) Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets Oct 2, 2022 Oct 3, 2021 Income tax receivable $ 27.7 $ 20.7 Government subsidies receivable 69.4 172.4 Other prepaid expenses and current assets 386.6 401.5 Total prepaid expenses and current assets $ 483.7 $ 594.6 Property, Plant and Equipment, net Oct 2, 2022 Oct 3, 2021 Land $ 46.1 $ 46.2 Buildings 555.4 587.6 Leasehold improvements 9,066.8 8,637.6 Store equipment 3,018.2 2,934.1 Roasting equipment 838.5 857.2 Furniture, fixtures and other 1,526.1 1,392.0 Work in progress 558.7 374.1 Property, plant and equipment, gross 15,609.8 14,828.8 Accumulated depreciation ( 9,049.3 ) ( 8,459.3 ) Property, plant and equipment, net $ 6,560.5 $ 6,369.5 Accrued Liabilities Oct 2, 2022 Oct 3, 2021 Accrued occupancy costs $ 84.6 $ 107.1 Accrued dividends payable 608.3 578.1 Accrued capital and other operating expenditures 878.1 840.7 Self-insurance reserves 232.3 229.3 Income taxes payable 139.2 348.0 Accrued business taxes 194.6 218.0 Total accrued liabilities $ 2,137.1 $ 2,321.2 Store Operating Expenses Year Ended Oct 2, 2022 Oct 3, 2021 Sep 27, 2020 Wages and benefits $ 8,157.7 $ 6,989.3 $ 6,131.9 Occupancy costs 2,674.1 2,561.5 2,388.0 Other expenses 2,730.0 2,380.1 2,244.1 Total store operating expenses $ 13,561.8 $ 11,930.9 $ 10,764.0 65 Table of Contents Note 8: Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets (in millions) Oct 2, 2022 Oct 3, 2021 Trade names, trademarks and patents $ 97.5 $ 96.4 Finite-Lived Intangible Assets Oct 2, 2022 Oct 3, 2021 (in millions) Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Amount Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Amount Acquired and reacquired rights $ 990.0 $ ( 990.0 ) $ — $ 1,141.5 $ ( 971.9 ) $ 169.6 Acquired trade secrets and processes 27.6 ( 27.3 ) 0.3 27.6 ( 24.8 ) 2.8 Trade names, trademarks and patents 124.6 ( 69.6 ) 55.0 126.3 ( 51.9 ) 74.4 Licensing agreements 19.3 ( 16.2 ) 3.1 18.8 ( 13.5 ) 5.3 Other finite-lived intangible assets 20.6 ( 20.6 ) — 24.0 ( 22.6 ) 1.4 Total finite-lived intangible assets $ 1,182.1 $ ( 1,123.7 ) $ 58.4 $ 1,338.2 $ ( 1,084.7 ) $ 253.5 Amortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets was $ 192.7 million, $ 223.4 million and $ 223.7 million during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our fiscal 2022 and 2021 analyses indicated excess fair values over carrying values for these assets, and therefore no impairment charge was recorded during these years. During the fiscal year ended September 27, 2020, we recorded a charge of $ 22.1 million to restructuring and impairments on our consolidated statement of earnings as the analysis indicated the carrying value of one of the assets exceeded its fair value.

During the fiscal year ended October 2, 2022, we completed our annual goodwill impairment analysis. The results of our analysis indicated significant excess fair values over carrying values across the different reporting units, and therefore no goodwill impairment was recorded. Note 9: Debt Revolving Credit Facility Our $ 3.0 billion unsecured 5-year revolving credit facility (the “2021 credit facility”), of which $ 150 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit, is currently set to mature on September 16, 2026 . The 2021 credit facility is available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases. We have the option, 66 Table of Contents subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $ 1.0 billion. Borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR, and, for U.S. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on the Company’s long-term credit ratings assigned by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s rating agencies. The 2021 credit facility contains alternative interest rate provisions specifying rate calculations to be used at such time LIBOR ceases to be available as a benchmark due to reference rate reform. The “Base Rate” of interest is the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.500 %, (ii) Bank of America’s prime rate, and (iii) the Eurocurrency Rate (as defined in the credit facility) plus 1.000 %. The 2021 credit facility contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which measures our ability to cover financing expenses. As of October 2, 2022, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. No amounts were outstanding under our 2021 credit facility as of October 2, 2022. Short-term Debt Under our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $ 3.0 billion, with individual maturities that may vary but not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. Amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program are required to be backstopped by available commitments under our credit facility discussed above. The proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper program may be used for working capital needs, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, business expansion, payment of cash dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. As of October 2, 2022, we had $ 175.0 million in borrowings outstanding under the program. As of October 3, 2021, we had no borrowings outstanding under this program. Additionally, we hold the following Japanese yen-denominated credit facilities that are available for working capital needs and capital expenditures within our Japanese market: • A ¥ 5 billion, or $34.6 million, facility is currently set to mature on December 31, 2022 .

Note 11: Deferred Revenue In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we licensed the rights to sell and market our products in authorized channels through the Global Coffee Alliance and received an up-front prepaid royalty from Nestlé. The up-front payment of approximately $ 7 billion was recorded as deferred revenue as we have continuing performance obligations to support the Global Coffee Alliance, including providing Nestlé access to certain intellectual properties and products for future resale. The up-front payment is being recognized as other revenue on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life of the arrangement of 40 years for the ongoing access to the licenses within the contractual territories. Our obligations to maintain the Starbucks brand and other intellectual properties are generally constant throughout the term of the arrangement. Therefore, a ratable recognition pattern is reflective of how we will satisfy our performance obligations. At October 2, 2022, the current and long-term deferred revenue related to the Nestlé up-front payment was $ 177.0 million and $ 6.2 billion, respectively.

Due to our business recovery and restoration of certain leverage metrics, we resumed our share repurchase program in the first quarter of fiscal 2022 and repurchased 36.3 million shares of common stock for $ 4.0 billion on the open market during the fiscal year ended October 2, 2022. On March 15, 2022, we announced that our Board authorized the repurchase of up to an additional 40 million shares under our ongoing share repurchase program.

Note 13: Employee Stock and Benefit Plans We maintain several equity incentive plans under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) or stock appreciation rights to employees, non-employee directors and consultants. We issue new shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options and the vesting of RSUs. We also have an employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”). As of October 2, 2022, there were 99.7 million shares of common stock available for issuance pursuant to future equity-based compensation awards and 10.8 million shares available for issuance under our ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements (in millions) : Fiscal Year Ended Oct 2, 2022 Oct 3, 2021 Sep 27, 2020 RSUs $ 271.8 $ 316.9 $ 241.0 Options ( 0.2 ) 2.2 7.5 Total stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings $ 271.6 $ 319.1 $ 248.5 Total related tax benefit $ 45.9 $ 51.6 $ 47.8 Total capitalized stock-based compensation included in net property, plant and equipment on the consolidated balance sheets $ 3.9 $ 3.7 $ 3.6 RSUs We have both time-vested and performance-based RSUs. Time-vested RSUs are awarded to eligible employees and entitle the grantee to receive shares of common stock at the end of a vesting period, subject to the employee’s continuing employment. The time-vested RSUs generally either vest in two or four equal annual installments beginning a year from the grant date. Our 72 Table of Contents performance-based RSUs are awarded to eligible employees and entitle the grantee to receive shares of common stock if we achieve specified performance goals during the performance period and the grantee remains employed through the vesting period. RSU transactions for the fiscal year ended October 2, 2022 (in millions, except per share and contractual life amounts) : Number of Shares Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value per Share Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life (Years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value Nonvested, October 3, 2021 7.7 $ 86.23 0.9 $ 869 Granted 4.2 107.71 Vested ( 3.7 ) 80.02 Forfeited/canceled ( 1.2 ) 100.04 Nonvested, October 2, 2022 7.0 98.88 1.0 587 As of October 2, 2022, total unrecogniz ed stock-based compensation expense related to nonvested RSUs, net of estimated forfeitures, was approximately $ 145 million , before income taxes, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.0 years . The total fair value of RSUs vested was $ 298 million, $ 226 million and $ 211 million during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. For fiscal 2021 and 2020, the weighted average fair value per RSU granted was $ 96.05 and $ 81.96 , respectively. Stock Options We may provide stock options as a form of employee compensation, which are primarily time-vested. The majority of time-vested options become exercisable in four equal installments beginning a year from the grant date and generally expire 10 years from the grant date. Options granted to non-employee directors generally vest immediately or one year from grant. All outstanding stock options are non-qualified stock options. No stock options were granted during the fiscal year ended October 2, 2022. The fair value of stock option awards was estimated at the grant date with the following weighted average assumptions for fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020: Stock Options Granted During the Period Fiscal Year Ended 2022 2021 2020 Expected term (in years) 0.0 8.1 7.8 Expected stock price volatility — % 26.3 % 27.3 % Risk-free interest rate — % 1.4 % 1.2 % Expected dividend yield — % 1.6 % 2.9 % Weighted average grant price $ — $ 110.46 $ 56.33 Estimated fair value per option granted $ — $ 27.59 $ 11.30 The expected term of the options represents the estimated period of time until exercise and is based on historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior. Expected stock price volatility is based on a combination of historical volatility of our stock and the one-year implied volatility of Starbucks traded options, for the related vesting periods. The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term. The dividend yield assumption is based on our anticipated cash dividend payouts. The amounts shown above for the estimated fair value per option granted are before the estimated effect of forfeitures, which reduce the amount of expense recorded in the consolidated statements of earnings. 73 Table of Contents Stock option transactions for the fiscal year ended October 2, 2022 (in millions, except per share and contractual life amounts) : Shares Subject to Options Weighted Average Exercise Price per Share Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life (Years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value Outstanding, October 3, 2021 5.2 $ 54.58 4.5 $ 303 Granted — — Exercised ( 1.1 ) 49.82 Expired/forfeited 0.0 48.45 Outstanding, October 2, 2022 4.1 55.86 3.6 117 Exercisable, October 2, 2022 4.1 55.86 3.6 117 Vested and expected to vest, October 2, 2022 4.1 55.86 3.6 117 The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above, which is the amount by which the market value of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price of outstanding options, is before applicable income taxes and represents the amount optionees would have realized if all in-the-money options had been exercised on the last business day of the period indicated. As of October 2, 2022, there was immaterial unrecognized stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to nonvested options. The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $ 57 million, $ 219 million and $ 236 million during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The total fair value of options vested was $ 8 million, $ 14 million and $ 25 million during fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. ESPP Our ESPP allows eligible employees to contribute up to 10 % of their base earnings toward the quarterly purchase of our common stock, subject to an annual maximum dollar amount. The purchase price is 95 % of the fair market value of the stock on the last business day of the quarterly offering period. The number of shares issued under our ESPP was 0.6 million in fiscal 2022. Deferred Compensation Plan We have a Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors under which non-employee directors may, for any fiscal year, irrevocably elect to defer receipt of shares of common stock the director would have received upon vesting of restricted stock units. The number of deferred shares outstanding related to deferrals made under this plan is not material. Defined Contribution Plans We maintain voluntary defined contribution plans, both qualified and non-qualified, covering eligible employees as defined in the plan documents. Participating employees may elect to defer and contribute a portion of their eligible compensation to the plans up to limits stated in the plan documents, not to exceed the dollar amounts set by applicable laws. Our matching contributions to all U.S. and non-U.S. plans were $ 156.7 million , $ 145.1 million and $ 132.7 million in fiscal 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

As of October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021, we had accrued interest and penalties of $ 9.4 million and $ 7.1 million, respectively, within our consolidated balance sheets. The following table summarizes the activity related to our unrecognized tax benefits (in millions) : Oct 2, 2022 Oct 3, 2021 Sep 27, 2020 Beginning balance $ 82.6 $ 123.7 $ 132.1 Increase related to prior year tax positions 0.2 4.8 11.1 Decrease related to prior year tax positions ( 0.7 ) ( 11.9 ) ( 0.5 ) Increase related to current year tax positions 9.0 8.9 9.8 Decreases related to settlements with taxing authorities — ( 4.4 ) — Decrease related to lapsing of statute of limitations ( 1.4 ) ( 38.5 ) ( 28.8 ) Ending balance $ 89.7 $ 82.6 $ 123.7 We are currently under examination, or may be subject to examination, by various U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions for fiscal 2016 through 2021. We are no longer subject to U.S. federal examination for years prior to fiscal 2018, U.S. state and local examinations for years prior to fiscal 2016 or examination in any material international markets prior to fiscal 2017. 76 Table of Contents We do not expect a significant amount of Company's gross unrecognized tax benefits to be recognized by the end of fiscal 2023 for reasons such as a lapse of the statute of limitations or resolution of examinations with tax authorities . Note 15: Earnings per Share Calculation of net earnings per common share (“EPS”) — basic and diluted (in millions, except EPS) : Fiscal Year Ended Oct 2, 2022 Oct 3, 2021 Sep 27, 2020 Net earnings attributable to Starbucks $ 3,281.6 $ 4,199.3 $ 928.3 Weighted average common shares outstanding (for basic calculation) 1,153.3 1,177.6 1,172.8 Dilutive effect of outstanding common stock options and RSUs 5.2 7.9 9.0 Weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding (for diluted calculation) 1,158.5 1,185.5 1,181.8 EPS — basic $ 2.85 $ 3.57 $ 0.79 EPS — diluted $ 2.83 $ 3.54 $ 0.79 Potential dilutive shares consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options (both vested and non-vested) and unvested RSUs, calculated using the treasury stock method. The calculation of dilutive shares outstanding would exclude out-of-the-money stock options (i.e., such options’ exercise prices were greater than the average market price of our common shares for the period) because their inclusion would be antidilutive. As of October 2, 2022, we had an immaterial amount of out-of-the-money stock options and antidilutive RSUs. As of October 3, 2021 and September 27, 2020, we had an immaterial amount of antidilutive RSUs and no out-of-the-money stock options. Note 16: Commitments and Contingencies Legal Proceedings In 2010 and 2011, an organization named Council for Education and Research on Toxics (“Plaintiff”) filed lawsuits in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles, against the Company and other companies who manufacture, package, distribute or sell brewed coffee. The suits were later consolidated into a single action. Plaintiff alleged that the Company and the other defendants failed to provide warnings for their coffee products of exposure to the chemical acrylamide as required under California Health and Safety Code section 25249.5, the California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, better known as Proposition 65. Plaintiff sought equitable relief, including providing warnings to consumers of coffee products, as well as civil penalties in the amount of the statutory maximum of two thousand five hundred dollars per day per alleged violation of Proposition 65, which the Plaintiff claimed was every day coffee is sold without a compliant warning. The Company denied the claims. During the pendency of the litigation, the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (“OEHHA”) proposed a new regulation clarifying that cancer warnings are not required for coffee under Proposition 65. The regulation was approved by the Office of Administrative Law and became effective on October 1, 2019. In 2020, the trial court granted the defendants’ motion for summary judgment, ruling that the coffee exemption regulation is a complete defense to the Plaintiff’s complaint. On October 26, 2022, the California Court of Appeal affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the case. The Plaintiff’s subsequent request for a rehearing before the Court of Appeals was denied. The Plaintiff has until December 5, 2022 to file a petition for review in the California Supreme Court. Starbucks believes that the likelihood that the Company will ultimately incur a material loss in connection with this litigation is less than reasonably possible. Accordingly, no loss contingency was recorded for this matter. Starbucks is involved in various other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including certain employment litigation cases that have been certified as class or collective actions, but, except as noted above, is not currently a party to any legal proceeding that management believes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Note 17: Segment Reporting Segment information is prepared on the same basis that our interim ceo, who is our Chief Operating Decision Maker, manages the segments, evaluates financial results and makes key operating decisions.

Revenues from countries other than the U.S. and China consist primarily of revenues from Japan, Canada and the U.K., which together account for approximately 74 % of net revenues from other countries for fiscal 2022. Management evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net revenues and operating income. The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates. Operating income represents earnings before other income and expenses and income taxes. The identifiable assets by segment disclosed in this note are those assets specifically identifiable within each segment and include cash and cash equivalents, ROU assets, net property, plant and equipment, equity and cost investments, goodwill and other intangible assets. Assets not attributed to reportable operating segments are corporate assets and are primarily comprised of cash and cash equivalents available for general corporate purposes, investments, assets of the corporate headquarters and roasting facilities and inventory. 78 Table of Contents The table below presents financial information for our reportable operating segments and Corporate and Other segment for the fiscal years ended October 2, 2022, October 3, 2021 and September 27, 2020.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 2, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of October 2, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 18, 2022, expresse d an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit and Compliance Committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Income Taxes — Indefinite Reinvestment of Foreign Earnings - Refer to Note 14 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description Under the provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes, (“ASC 740”), there is a presumption that investments in foreign subsidiaries will be recovered upon sale or through a partial or complete distribution of earnings to the parent entity, and therefore subject the parent entity to additional taxes. If sufficient evidence shows the foreign subsidiary has invested or will invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely, the ASC 740 presumption may be overcome, and no additional taxes shall be accrued. The Company has investments in the profitable operations of certain foreign subsidiaries that may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and/or U.S. federal and state income taxes upon sale or a partial or complete distribution of earnings, incremental to local income taxes already paid. As o f October 2, 2022, th e Company is partially indefinitely reinvested in certain foreign subsidiaries. The Company has recorded a deferred tax liability of $75 million related to the taxable temporary difference for which it is not indefinitely reinvested. For the remaining $1.5 billion of taxable temporary difference, there could be up to approximately $230 million of unrecognized tax liability. The Company’s assertion of partial indefinite reinvestment for certain foreign subsidiaries requires management to make long-term forecasting assumptions and detailed plans for reinvestment. The most significant assumption supporting the Company’s indefinite reinvestment assertion is the forecast of capital expenditures in international markets. Performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s indefinite reinvestment analysis and capital expenditures forecast required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our income tax specialists. 80 Table of Contents How the Critical Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our principal audit procedures related to management’s indefinite reinvestment analysis and the supporting forecast of capital expenditures for certain foreign subsidiaries, included the following, among others: • We tested the effectiveness of controls related to management’s forecast of capital expenditures. • We performed a retrospective review of management’s historical ability to accurately forecast capital expenditures by comparing actual results to management’s historical forecast. • We inquired of senior executives of the Company to corroborate strategic plans for growth. • We compared the forecasts obtained to support the indefinite reinvestment assertion to: ◦ Historical capital expenditures, including costs per new store opening; ◦ Historical new store growth; and ◦ Historical profitability of new stores by region; and ◦ Forecasts used by the Company for financial reporting purposes in other areas, such as the evaluation of the recoverability of goodwill; and ◦ Internal communications to management and the Board of Directors; and ◦ Forecasted information included in the Company’s press releases, other external communications and analyst reports; and ◦ External publications of expected industry growth. • With the assistance of our tax specialists, we evaluated the appropriateness of management’s analysis under ASC 740 and the sufficiency of the evidence provided by management to support that the Company has the intent and ability to partially indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Seattle, Washington November 18, 2022 We have served as the Company's auditor since 1987. 81 Table of Contents Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure Not applicable. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed or submitted under the Exchange Act, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our interim chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of the end of the period covered by this report (October 2, 2022). There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect internal control over financial reporting. The certifications required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 are filed as exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 , respectively, to this 10-K. Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework , issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. This evaluation included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of October 2, 2022. Our internal control over financial reporting as of October 2, 2022 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein. 82 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Starbucks Corporation Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Starbucks Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of October 2, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 2, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended October 2, 2022, of the Company and our report dated November 18, 2022, expre ssed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Seattle, Washington November 18, 2022 83 Table of Contents Item 9B.

Business General In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“10-K” or “Report”) for the fiscal year ended October 3, 2021 (“fiscal 2021”), Starbucks Corporation (together with its subsidiaries) is referred to as “Starbucks,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our.” Starbucks is the premier roaster, marketer and retailer of specialty coffee in the world, operating in 84 markets. Formed in 1985, Starbucks Corporation’s common stock trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (“Nasdaq”) under the symbol “SBUX.” We purchase and roast high-quality coffees that we sell, along with handcrafted coffee, tea and other beverages and a variety of high-quality food items through company-operated stores. We also sell a variety of coffee and tea products and license our trademarks through other channels, such as licensed stores as well as grocery and foodservice through our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestlé S.A. (“Nestlé”). In addition to our flagship Starbucks Coffee brand, we sell goods and services under the following brands: Teavana, Seattle’s Best Coffee, Evolution Fresh, Ethos, Starbucks Reserve and Princi. Our primary objective is to maintain Starbucks standing as one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world. We believe our work to create a company that is profit-, people- and planet-positive, along with our ability to successfully execute strategies that support this work, contribute to our primary objective. Profit-Positive Our profit-positive efforts are aligned with our global long-term “Growth at Scale” agenda to deliver consistent revenue and income growth, through focus and discipline. We believe incremental investments in our brand, principally to support our people- and planet-positive work, will deliver long-term targeted revenue and income growth. This includes expansion of our global store base, adding stores in both existing, developed markets such as the U.S. and in newer, higher growth markets such as China, as well as optimizing the mix of company-operated and licensed stores around the world. In addition, by leveraging experiences gained through our stores and elsewhere, we continue to drive beverage, equipment, process and technology innovation. We strive to regularly offer consumers new, innovative coffee and other products in a variety of forms, across new categories, diverse channels and alternative store formats. We are committed to further investments in our partners (employees) and our industry-leading digital platform as well as environmental, social and governance issues underscoring our mission and values. Our disciplined capital allocation methodology, which prioritizes high-return investments as well as share repurchases and competitive dividends, rounds out our “Growth at Scale” agenda and our profit-positive vision. People-Positive Our people-positive vision is to cultivate an inclusive environment where everyone belongs. This includes empowering our partners with opportunities to pursue their aspirations while living our mission and values, acting with empathy and compassion and sharing in our success. This enables our partners to deliver an elevated Starbucks Experience to our customers every day. We also strive to develop long-lasting trust and make tangible differences in the communities where we serve by investing in humanity and the well-being of everyone we connect with, advancing initiatives that support diversity, equity and inclusion through education, pay equity, hiring commitments and meaningful community involvement, including donations. Planet-Positive Our planet-positive vision is to give back more than we take from the planet. This includes reducing our environmental impacts, such as expanding reusable packaging, conserving water, shifting to renewable energy and eliminating landfill waste, and committing to the sustainability of high-quality coffee and other raw materials. Sustainability of our raw materials, especially coffee, is paramount to our business operations. We are committed to ethically sourcing coffee, tea and cocoa, donating disease-resistant coffee trees to farmers, providing farmers access to low-interest loans and sharing the expertise of our agronomists with all coffee farmers, among other things. Human Capital Management As a company, Starbucks mission is not only to deliver outstanding financial results by offering exceptional and unique products and services, but to also create a strong connection with the communities where we operate. We believe the strength of our workforce is one of the significant contributors to our success as a global brand that leads with purpose as part of our people-positive vision. This is largely attributed to our partners who strive every day to create a welcoming and inclusive environment. Therefore, one of our core strategies is to invest in and support our partners to differentiate our brand, products and services in the competitive specialty coffee market, including the following areas of focus: Oversight and Management We recognize the diversity of customers, partners and communities, and believe in creating an inclusive and equitable environment that represents a broad spectrum of backgrounds and cultures. Working under these principles, our Partner 2 Table of Contents Resources Organization is tasked with managing employment-related matters, including recruiting and hiring, onboarding and training, compensation planning, performance management and professional development. Our Board of Directors and Board committees provide oversight on certain human capital matters, including our Inclusion and Diversity programs and initiatives. As noted in its charter, our Compensation and Management Development Committee is responsible for periodically reviewing Starbucks partner resource programs and initiatives, including healthcare and other benefits, as well as our management development and succession planning practices and strategies. Our Audit and Compliance Committee works closely with the Risk Management Committee, led by Starbucks cfo and general counsel, to monitor and mitigate current and emerging labor and human capital management risks. Furthermore, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, in consultation with management, including our chief partner officer and chief inclusion and diversity officer, annually evaluates the effectiveness of our social responsibility policies, goals and programs, which also include partner-related issues. These reports and recommendations to the Board and its committees are part of the broader framework that guides how Starbucks should attract, retain and develop a skilled workforce that aligns with our values and strategies. We regularly conduct anonymous surveys to seek feedback from our partners on a variety of topics, including confidence in company leadership, competitiveness of our compensation and benefits package, career growth opportunities and recommendations on how we can remain an employer of choice. The results are shared with our partners and reviewed by senior leadership, who analyze areas of progress or deterioration and prioritize actions and activities in response to this feedback to drive meaningful improvements in partner engagement. Our management and cross-functional teams also work closely to evaluate human capital management issues such as partner retention, workplace safety, harassment and bullying, as well as to implement measures to mitigate these risks. Diversity, Equity and Inclusion We are committed to creating a welcoming and inclusive environment. We believe it is our responsibility to advance racial and social equity, and we are committed to furthering that work with intention, transparency and accountability. In 2021, we published our third Civil Rights Assessment that evaluated our ongoing efforts related to diversity, equity and inclusion and how they support our mission and values. The report addressed our progress over time and provides recommendations for how we can better advance diversity, equity and inclusion on behalf of our partners, customers and communities. We continue to welcome our partners, customers, civil rights and community leaders, along with our chief inclusion and diversity officer, to advise us along this journey. Starbucks has made specific racial equity commitments based on our principles of being intentional, transparent and accountable at all levels: • Being intentional in cultivating a culture of inclusion, with a focus on partner retention and development. ◦ Launching a mentorship program connecting black, indigenous and people of color (“BIPOC”) partners to senior leaders, beginning with a cohort of leaders, senior vice president and above, as well as BIPOC directors in corporate and retail roles. ◦ Investing in strategic partnerships with professional organizations that focus on the development of BIPOC talent, providing additional development opportunities for our BIPOC partners. • Being transparent in our approach to Inclusion and Diversity goal setting and progress. ◦ Publicly sharing workforce diversity data. ◦ Setting annual Inclusion and Diversity goals based on retention rates and progress towards achieving BIPOC representation. Our goal is for at least 30% of all corporate roles and at least 40% of all retail and manufacturing roles to be held by BIPOC partners by 2025. • Holding ourselves accountable at the highest levels of the organization. ◦ Incorporating metrics focused on building inclusive and diverse teams into our executive compensation programs beginning in fiscal 2021. ◦ Joining the Board Diversity Action Alliance to act alongside other companies similarly committed to increasing racially and ethnically diverse representation on corporate boards of directors. ◦ Publicizing self-identified race/ethnicity of each member of our board of directors. Total Rewards We have demonstrated a history of investing in our workforce by offering competitive salaries and wages by continuously assessing the current business environment and labor market. We have consistently made enhancements in wages in order to attract talent to support our growth strategy and to elevate the customer experience. To foster a stronger sense of ownership and 3 Table of Contents align the interests of partners with shareholders, restricted stock units are provided to eligible non-executive partners under our broad-based stock incentive programs. Furthermore, we offer comprehensive, locally relevant and innovative benefits to all eligible partners. In the U.S., our largest and most mature market, these include: • Comprehensive health insurance coverage is offered to partners working an average of 20 hours or more each week. • 100% upfront tuition coverage is offered through the Starbucks College Achievement Plan for partners to earn a first-time bachelor's degree online at Arizona State University. • 100% paid parental leave is available to new parents that welcome a child through birth, adoption or foster placement and work an average of 20 hours or more each week. • A Partner and Family Sick Time program is provided and allows partners to accrue paid sick time based on hours worked and use that time for themselves or family members in need of care. • Care@Work benefit provides partners with backup care benefits for children and adults at a small cost to partners, as well as free unlimited senior care planning services. This benefit includes up to 30 days of backup care services through the end of fiscal 2022, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. • We view mental health as a fundamental part of our humanity and provide a comprehensive suite of related programs and benefits. These include a free subscription to Headspace, an online application that enables guided mediation, and 20 free mental health therapy or coaching sessions annually with Lyra. Outside of the U.S., we have provided other innovative benefits to help address market-specific needs, such as providing interest-free loans to our U.K. partners to help cover rental deposits, mental health services in Canada, and in China, a monthly housing subsidy for full-time Starbucks baristas and shift supervisors, as well as comprehensive health insurance coverage for parents of partners. Role-based Support To help our partners succeed in their roles, we emphasize continuous training and development opportunities. These include, but are not limited to, safety and security protocols, updates on new products and service offerings and deployment of technologies. Training provided through our Pour Over sessions, which are a series of inspiring talks with thought leaders to help partners understand how to bring the Starbucks Experience to life, include a wide variety of topics such as achievable goal setting, giving and receiving constructive feedback and effective engagement with customers and communities. To help further promote an inclusive culture and to better serve our customers, we encourage U.S.-based partners to enroll in the To Be Welcoming courses we created in partnership with Arizona State University to address different forms of bias and discrimination. Pay Equity To be an employer of choice and maintain the strength of our workforce, we consistently assess the current business environment and labor market to refine our compensation and benefits programs and other resources available to our partners. We previously achieved and currently maintain 100 percent pay equity in the U.S. for women and men and people of all races for partners performing similar work. We have also achieved gender pay equity in China and Canada, two of our largest markets outside of the U.S., and we made a commitment to achieve gender pay equity in all company-operated markets. Further, we have formulated pay-equity principles which provide equal footing, transparency and accountability as best practices that help address known, systemic barriers to global pay equity. As of October 3, 2021, Starbucks employed approximately 383,000 people worldwide. In the U.S., Starbucks employed approximately 245,000 people, with approximately 235,000 in company-operated stores and the remainder in corporate support, store development, roasting, manufacturing, warehousing and distribution operations. Approximately 138,000 employees were employed outside of the U.S., with approximately 135,000 in company-operated stores and the remainder in regional support operations. The number of Starbucks partners represented by unions is not significant. We believe our efforts in managing our workforce have been effective, evidenced by a strong Starbucks culture and a good relationship between the company and our partners. 4 Table of Contents Information about our Executive Officers Name Age Position Kevin R.

Segment Financial Information Segment information is prepared on the same basis that our management reviews financial information for operational decision-making purposes. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, certain changes were made to our management team, and our operating segment reporting structure was re-aligned as a result. Specifically, we realigned our fully licensed Latin America and Caribbean markets from our Americas operating segment to our International operating segment. Additionally, we renamed the Americas operating segment to the North America operating segment, comprised of our company-operated and licensed stores in the U.S. and Canada.We also made certain other immaterial changes between our International operating segment and Corporate and Other. We have three reportable operating segments: 1) North America, which is inclusive of the U.S. and Canada; 2) International, which is inclusive of China, Japan, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Latin America and Caribbean; and 3) Channel Development. Non-reportable operating segments such as Evolution Fresh and unallocated corporate expenses are reported within Corporate and Other. Revenues from our reportable operating segments as a percentage of total net revenues for fiscal 2021 were as follows: North America (70%), International (24%) and Channel Development (6%). Our North America and International segments include both company-operated and licensed stores. Our North America segment is our most mature business and has achieved significant scale. Certain markets within our International operations are in various stages of development and may require more extensive support, relative to their current levels of revenue and operating income, than our North America operations. Our Channel Development segment includes roasted whole bean and ground coffees, Seattle’s Best Coffee ® , Starbucks- and Teavana-branded single-serve products, a variety of ready-to-drink beverages, such as Frappuccino ® and Starbucks Doubleshot ® , foodservice products and other branded products sold worldwide outside of our company-operated and licensed stores. A large portion of our Channel Development business operates under a licensed model of the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestlé, while our global ready-to-drink businesses operate under collaborative relationships with PepsiCo, Inc., Tingyi-Ashi Beverages Holding Co., Ltd., Arla Foods amba and others. 6 Table of Contents Revenue Components We generate the majority of our revenues through company-operated stores and licensed stores. Company-operated and Licensed Store Summary as of October 3, 2021 North America As a% of Total North America Stores International As a% of Total International Stores Total As a% of Total Stores Company-operated stores 9,861 59 % 7,272 43 % 17,133 51 % Licensed stores 6,965 41 % 9,735 57 % 16,700 49 % Total 16,826 100 % 17,007 100 % 33,833 100 % The mix of company-operated versus licensed stores in a given market generally varies based on several factors, including our ability to access desirable local retail space, the complexity, profitability and expected ultimate size of the market for Starbucks and our ability to leverage the support infrastructure within a geographic region. Company-operated Stores Revenue from company-operated stores accounted for 85% of total net revenues during fiscal 2021. Our retail objective is to be the leading retailer and brand of coffee and tea in each of our target markets by selling the finest quality coffee, tea and related products, as well as complementary food offerings, and by providing each customer with a unique Starbucks Experience . The Starbucks Experience is built upon superior customer service, convenience and a seamless digital experience as well as safe, clean and well-maintained stores that reflect the personalities of the communities in which they operate, thereby building a high degree of customer loyalty. Our strategy for expanding our global retail business is to increase our category share in a disciplined manner, by selectively opening additional stores in new and existing markets, as well as increasing sales in existing stores, to support our long-term strategic objective to maintain Starbucks standing as one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world. Store growth in specific existing markets will vary due to many factors, including expected financial returns, the maturity of the market, economic conditions, consumer behavior and local business practices.

Our ability to vary the size and format of our stores allows us to locate them in or near a variety of settings, including downtown and suburban retail centers, office buildings, university campuses and rural and off-highway locations. We are continuing the expansion of our stores, particularly drive-thru formats that provide a higher degree of access and convenience, and alternative store formats, which are designed to provide a more streamlined customer experience in dense metropolitan areas. Prior to the global COVID-19 pandemic, approximately 80% of Starbucks transactions in U.S. company-operated stores were “on-the-go” occasions. This has prompted us to reexamine our U.S. store footprint and evolve our retail presence over time 7 Table of Contents through targeted store renovations, relocations and new stores. We have since introduced new store formats, such as Starbucks ® Pickup, Starbucks Now stores and curbside pickup, to enhance the “on-the-go” customer experience and improve operating efficiency across Starbucks ® stores in certain major metropolitan areas in the United States. New store formats are suitable for customers who prefer to order ahead and pay through the Starbucks ® Mobile App for pick-up. In our major international markets, we continue to invest in technology and establish partnerships with third parties with relevant expertise to increase digital adoption to provide convenience and elevate the customer experience. In China, the introduction of Starbucks Now TM stores is intended to enable a seamless integration of physical and digital customer touchpoints. Orders may be placed in advance through the Starbucks Mobile App or Starbucks Delivers TM and can be conveniently picked up by customers and delivery providers in these express retail format locations. These strategies align closely with rapidly evolving customer preferences, including higher levels of mobile ordering, more contactless pick-up experiences and reduced in-store congestion, all of which naturally allow for greater physical distancing. We believe our continued efforts to transform our store portfolio and elevate technology will enhance the customer experience and position Starbucks for long-term growth. Retail sales mix by product type for company-operated stores: Fiscal Year Ended Oct 3, 2021 Sep 27, 2020 Sep 29, 2019 Beverages 74 % 75 % 74 % Food 21 % 20 % 20 % Other (1) 5 % 5 % 6 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % (1) “Other” primarily consists of sales of packaged and single-serve coffees and teas, serveware and ready-to-drink beverages, among other items. Stored Value Cards and Loyalty Program The Starbucks Card, our branded stored value card program, is designed to provide customers with a convenient payment method, support gifting and increase the frequency of store visits by cardholders, in part through the related Starbucks ® Rewards loyalty program where available, as discussed below. Stored value cards are issued to customers when they initially load them with an account balance. They can be obtained in our company-operated and most licensed stores in North America, China, Japan and many of our markets in our International segment. Stored value cards can also be obtained online, via the Starbucks ® Mobile App and through other U.S. and international retailers. Customers may access their card balances by utilizing their stored value card or the Starbucks ® Mobile App in participating stores. In nearly all markets, including the U.S. and Canada, customers who register their Starbucks Cards are automatically enrolled in the Starbucks Rewards program. Registered members can receive various benefits depending on factors such as the number of reward points (“Stars”) earned. In addition to using their Starbucks Cards, Starbucks ® Rewards members can earn Stars by paying with cash, credit or debit cards, or selected mobile wallets at company-operated stores in the U.S. and Canada. Using the Mobile Order and Pay functionality of the Starbucks ® Mobile App, customers can also place orders in advance for pick-up at certain participating locations in several markets. Refer to Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, for further discussion of our stored value cards and loyalty program. Licensed Stores Revenues from our licensed stores accounted for 9% of total net revenues in fiscal 2021. Licensed stores generally have a lower gross margin and a higher operating margin than company-operated stores. Under the licensed model, Starbucks receives a margin on branded products and supplies sold to the licensed store operator along with a royalty on retail sales. Licensees are responsible for operating costs and capital investments, which more than offset the lower revenues we receive under the licensed store model. In our licensed store operations, we seek to leverage the expertise of our local partners and share our operating and store development experience. Licensees provide improved, and at times the only, access to desirable retail space. Most licensees are prominent retailers with in-depth market knowledge and access. As part of these arrangements, we sell coffee, tea, food and related products to licensees for resale to customers and receive royalties and license fees from the licensees. We also sell certain equipment, such as coffee brewers and espresso machines, to our licensees for use in their operations. Licensee employees working in licensed retail locations are required to follow our detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to employees in company-operated stores. In a limited number of international markets, we also use traditional franchising and include these stores in the results of operations from our other licensed stores. 8 Table of Contents Licensed store data for the fiscal year-ended October 3, 2021: Stores Open as of Stores Open as of Sep 27, 2020 Opened Closed Transfers Net Oct 3, 2021 North America: U.S. 6,387 191 (100) 19 110 6,497 Canada 444 48 (28) 4 24 468 Total North America (1) 6,831 239 (128) 23 134 6,965 International: Korea 1,468 166 (23) — 143 1,611 Mexico 752 7 (13) — (6) 746 U.K. 737 68 (14) — 54 791 Latin America 662 35 (6) — 29 691 Turkey 530 36 (7) — 29 559 Taiwan 501 28 (6) — 22 523 Indonesia 458 29 — — 29 487 Thailand 405 26 (6) — 20 425 Philippines 396 5 — — 5 401 All Other 3,283 313 (97) 2 218 3,501 Total International (1) 9,192 713 (172) 2 543 9,735 Total licensed 16,023 952 (300) 25 677 16,700 (1) North America and International licensed stores as of September 27, 2020, have been recast as a result of our fiscal 2021 operating segment reporting structure realignment. Other Revenues Other revenues primarily are recorded in our Channel Development segment and include sales of packaged coffee, tea and ready-to-drink beverages to customers outside of our company-operated and licensed stores, as well as royalties received from Nestlé under the Global Coffee Alliance and other collaborative partnerships. Product Supply Starbucks is committed to selling the finest whole bean coffees and coffee beverages. To help ensure compliance with our rigorous coffee standards, we generally control substantially all coffee purchasing, roasting and packaging and the global distribution of coffee used in our operations. Nestlé controls distribution of certain finished goods through the Global Coffee Alliance. We purchase green coffee beans from multiple coffee-producing regions around the world and custom roast them to our exacting standards for our many blends and single origin coffees. The price of coffee is subject to significant volatility. Although most coffee trades in the commodity market, high-altitude arabica coffee of the quality sought by Starbucks tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the “C” coffee commodity price. Both the premium and the commodity price depend upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase. Supply and price can be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, including weather, water supply quality and availability throughout the coffee production chain, natural disasters, crop disease and pests, general increase in farm inputs and costs of production, inventory levels and political and economic conditions. Climate change may further exacerbate many of these factors. Price is also impacted by trading activities in the arabica coffee futures market, including hedge funds and commodity index funds. In addition, green coffee prices have been affected in the past, and may be affected in the future, by the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies. We buy coffee using fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed purchase commitments, depending on market conditions, to secure an adequate supply of quality green coffee. We also utilize forward contracts, futures contracts and collars to hedge ""C"" price exposure under our price-to-be-fixed green coffee contracts and our long-term forecasted coffee demand where underlying fixed price and price-to-be-fixed contracts are not yet available. Total purchase commitments, together with existing inventory, are expected to provide an adequate supply of green coffee through fiscal 2022. 9 Table of Contents We depend upon our relationships with coffee producers, outside trading companies and exporters for our supply of green coffee. We believe, based on relationships established with our suppliers, the risk of non-delivery on such purchase commitments is remote. To help ensure the future supply of high-quality green coffee and to reinforce our leadership role in the coffee industry, Starbucks operates ten farmer support centers, including our China Farmer Support Center located in the Yunnan Province of this high-growth market. Farmer support centers are staffed with agronomists and sustainability experts who work with coffee farming communities to promote best practices in coffee production designed to improve both coffee quality and yields and agronomy support to address climate change and other impacts. In addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy and plant-based dairy-free alternative products, particularly fluid milk, oat milk and almond milk, to support the needs of our company-operated stores. We believe, based on relationships established with our dairy and plant-based dairy-free suppliers, that the risk of non-delivery of sufficient fluid milk and plant-based dairy-free alternatives to support our stores generally is remote. Products other than whole bean coffees and coffee beverages sold in Starbucks ® stores include tea and a number of ready-to-drink beverages that are purchased from several specialty suppliers, usually under long-term supply contracts. Food products, such as pastries, breakfast sandwiches and lunch items, are purchased from national, regional and local sources. We also purchase a broad range of paper and plastic products, such as cups and cutlery, from several companies to support the needs of our retail stores as well as our manufacturing and distribution operations. Consistent with our planet-positive vision, we are also expanding our use of reusable packaging to reduce landfill waste. We believe, based on relationships established with these suppliers and manufacturers, that the risk of non-delivery of sufficient amounts of these items generally is remote. During fiscal 2021, we began to experience certain supply shortages and transportation delays largely attributable to impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as changes in customer demand and behaviors. While we expect these shortages and delays may continue into fiscal 2022, we view them to be temporary and do not believe they will have a material impact to our long-term growth and profitability. Competition Our primary competitors for coffee beverage sales are specialty coffee retailers and shops. We believe that our customers choose among specialty coffee retailers and shops primarily on the basis of product quality, brand reputation, service and convenience, as well as price. We continue to experience direct competition from large competitors in the quick-service restaurant sector and the ready-to-drink coffee beverage market, in addition to both well-established and start-up companies in many international markets. We also compete with restaurants and other specialty retailers for prime retail locations and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores. Our coffee and tea products sold through our Channel Development segment compete directly against specialty coffees and teas sold through grocery stores, warehouse clubs, specialty retailers, convenience stores and foodservice accounts and compete indirectly against all other coffees and teas on the market. Trademarks, Copyrights, Patents and Domain Names Starbucks owns and has applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and in other countries throughout the world. Some of our trademarks, including Starbucks, the Starbucks logo, Starbucks Reserve, Seattle’s Best Coffee, Teavana and Frappuccino are of material importance. The duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained. We own numerous copyrights for items such as product packaging, promotional materials, in-store graphics and training materials. We also hold patents on certain products, systems and designs which have an average remaining useful life of approximately two years. In addition, Starbucks has registered and maintains numerous Internet domain names, including “Starbucks.com,” “Starbucks.net,” “Starbucksreserve.com,” “Seattlesbest.com” and “Teavana.com.” Seasonality and Quarterly Results Our business is subject to moderate seasonal fluctuations, of which our fiscal second quarter typically experiences lower revenues and operating income. The COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on consumer behaviors and customer traffic; however, it is not yet certain that these changes will sustain and cause other than temporary changes in the seasonal fluctuations of our business. Additionally, as Starbucks Cards are issued to and loaded by customers during the holiday season, we tend to have higher cash flows from operations during the first quarter of the fiscal year. However, since revenues from Starbucks Cards are recognized upon redemption and not when cash is loaded onto the Card, the impact of seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings is much less pronounced. As a result of moderate seasonal fluctuations, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year. 10 Table of Contents Government Regulation As a company with global operations, we are subject to the laws and regulations of the United States and the multiple foreign jurisdictions in which we operate as well as the rules, reporting obligations and interpretations of all such requirements and obligations by various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions. In addition, changes to such laws, regulations, rules, reporting obligations and related compliance obligations could result in significant costs but are not expected to have a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position as compared to prior periods.

Risk Factors You should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations section, the Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk section, and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. If any of the risks and uncertainties described in the cautionary factors described below actually occur or continue to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. The considerations and risks that follow are organized within relevant headings but may be relevant to other headings as well. Moreover, the risks below are not the only risks we face and additional risks not currently known to us or that we presently deem immaterial may emerge or become material at any time and may negatively impact our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations or the trading price of our common stock. Risks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions • Our financial condition and results of operations have been and are expected to continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and is continuing to have, a significant impact on our business and results of operations. At the peak of the COVID-19 outbreak, many of our company-operated and licensed stores were closed. For stores that remained open, same-store sales declined due to modified operating hours and reduced customer traffic. While nearly all of our company-operated and licensed stores have reopened, we expect that our operations will continue to be impacted by the continuing effects of COVID-19, including resurgences and variants of the virus. It remains difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the broader economy and how consumer behavior may change, and whether such change is temporary or permanent. Social distancing, telecommunicating and reductions in travel may become the new normal. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has required and may continue to require us to make controversial decisions about precautionary measures, such as vaccinations, showing proof of vaccinations and face coverings, that could impact our results, including by impacting our brand, our employee retention and satisfaction, and the willingness of customers to buy our products. All of these conditions could fundamentally impact the way we work and the services we provide, and could have continuing adverse effects on our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. As a result, we may incur additional impairment charges to our inventory, store and corporate assets—and our ability to realize the benefits from deferred tax assets may become limited—any of which may have a significant or material impact on our financial results. Prolonged volatility or significant disruption of global financial markets due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic could have a negative impact on our ability to access capital markets and other funding sources, on acceptable terms or at all and impede our ability to comply with debt covenants. • Our financial condition and results of operations are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, a number of other factors, many of which are also largely outside our control. In addition to the COVID-19 pandemic, our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to a number of other factors, many of which are largely outside our control. Any one or more of the factors listed below or described elsewhere in this risk factors section could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and/or results of operations: • increases in real estate costs in certain domestic and international markets; 11 Table of Contents • inflationary pressures; • disruptions to our supply chain; • changes in governmental rules and approaches to taxation; • fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; • adverse outcomes of litigation; • severe weather or other natural or man-made disasters affecting a large market or several closely located markets that may temporarily but significantly affect our retail business in such markets; • changes in climate, including changes to the frequency of severe weather events, that impact the price and availability or cost of goods and services, energy and other materials throughout our supply chain; and • especially in our largest markets, including the U.S. and China, labor discord or disruption, geopolitical events, war, terrorism (including incidents targeting us), political instability, acts of public violence, boycotts, increasing anti-American sentiment in certain markets, hostilities and social unrest and other health pandemics that lead to avoidance of public places or restrictions on public gatherings such as in our stores. • Economic conditions in the U.S. and international markets could adversely affect our business and financial results. As a retailer that is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending, our results of operations are sensitive to changes in or uncertainty about macro-economic conditions. Our customers may have or in the future have less money for discretionary purchases and may stop or reduce their purchases of our products or switch to Starbucks or competitors’ lower-priced products as a result of various factors, including job losses, inflation, higher taxes, reduced access to credit, changes in federal economic policy, the COVID-19 pandemic and recent international trade disputes. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic or other global health events, we may experience a reduction and/or increased volatility in demand for our products, which may be caused by, among other things: store closures or modified operating hours and business model, reduced customer traffic due to illness, quarantine or government or self-imposed restrictions placed on our stores’ operations, impacts caused by precautionary measures such as those related to face coverings and vaccinations, and changes in consumer spending behaviors (e.g. continued practice of social distancing, decrease in consumer confidence in general macroeconomic conditions and a decrease in consumer discretionary spending). Decreases in customer traffic and/or average value per transaction without a corresponding decrease in costs would put downward pressure on margins and would negatively impact our financial results. There is also a risk that if negative economic conditions or uncertainty, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, persist for a long period of time or worsen, consumers may make long-lasting changes to their discretionary purchasing behavior, including less frequent discretionary purchases on a more permanent basis or there may be a general downturn in the restaurant industry. These and other macroeconomic factors could have an adverse effect on our sales, profitability or development plans, which could harm our results of operations and financial condition. • Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance and fluctuations in the stock market as a whole will likely adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock. Failure to meet market expectations going forward, particularly with respect to our operational and financial results and related guidance, environmental performance and shareholder returns, will likely result in a decline and/or increased volatility in the market price of our stock. In addition, price and volume fluctuations in the stock market as a whole may affect the market price of our stock in ways that may be unrelated to our financial performance. Risks Related to Brand Relevance and Brand Execution • Our success depends substantially on the value of our brands and failure to preserve their value could have a negative impact on our financial results. We believe we have built an excellent reputation globally for the quality of our products, for delivery of a consistently positive consumer experience and for our global social and environmental impact programs. The Starbucks brand is recognized throughout most of the world, and we have received high ratings in global brand value studies. To be successful in the future, particularly outside of the U.S. where the Starbucks brand and our other brands are less well-known, we believe we must preserve, grow and leverage the value of our brands across all sales channels. Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities. Business incidents, whether isolated or recurring and whether originating from us or our business partners, that erode consumer trust can significantly reduce brand value, potentially trigger boycotts of our stores or result in civil or criminal liability and can have a negative impact on our financial results. Such incidents include actual or perceived breaches of privacy or violations of domestic or international privacy laws, contaminated food, product recalls, store employees or other food handlers infected with communicable diseases, such as COVID-19, or other potential incidents discussed in this risk factors section. The impact of 12 Table of Contents such incidents may be exacerbated if they receive considerable publicity, including rapidly through social or digital media (including for malicious reasons) or result in litigation. Consumer demand for our products and our brand equity could diminish significantly if we, our employees, licensees or other business partners fail to preserve the quality of our products, act or are perceived to act in an unethical, illegal, racially-biased, unequal or socially irresponsible manner, including with respect to the sourcing, content or sale of our products, service and treatment of customers at Starbucks stores, treatment of employees, or the use of customer data for general or direct marketing or other purposes. Furthermore, if we are not effective in addressing our social and environmental program goals, including our people- and planet-positive work, or achieving relevant sustainability goals, consumer trust in our brand may suffer. Additionally, if we fail to comply with laws and regulations, take controversial positions or actions or fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience in each of our markets, including by failing to invest in the right balance of wages and benefits to attract and retain employees that represent the brand well or to foster an inclusive and diverse environment, our brand value may be diminished. The ongoing relevance of our brand may depend on the success of our people- and planet-positive initiatives, which require company-wide coordination and alignment. We are working to manage risks and costs to us, our licensees and our supply chain of any effects of climate change as well as diminishing energy and water resources. These risks include any increased public focus, including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations, on these and other environmental sustainability matters, including packaging and waste, animal health and welfare, deforestation and land use. These risks may also include any increased pressure to make commitments, set targets or establish additional goals and take actions to meet them, which could expose us to market, operational and execution costs or risks. • If our business partners and third-party providers do not satisfactorily fulfill their responsibilities and commitments, it could damage our brand and our financial results could suffer. Our global business strategy, including our plans for new stores, branded products and other initiatives, relies significantly on a variety of business partners, including licensee and joint venture relationships, third-party manufacturers, distributors and retailers, particularly for our entire global Channel Development business. Licensees, retailers and foodservice operators are often authorized to use our logos and provide branded food, beverage and other products directly to customers. We believe our customers expect the same quality of service regardless of whether they visit a licensed or company-operated store, so we provide training and support to, and monitor the operations of, certain of these licensees and other business partners. However, the product quality and service they deliver may still be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control, including financial constraints caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and other factors. We do not have direct control over our business partners, including in their adherence to additional sanitation protocols and guidelines as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and may not have visibility into their practices. We also source our food, beverage and other products from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners, and in certain cases such products are produced or sourced by our licensees directly. And although foodservice operators are authorized to use our logos and provide branded products as part of their foodservice business, we do not monitor the quality of non-Starbucks products served in those locations. Additionally, inconsistent uses of our brand and other of our intellectual property assets, as well as failure to protect our intellectual property, can erode consumer trust and our brand value and have a material negative impact on our financial results. • Incidents involving food or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, adulteration, contamination or mislabeling, whether or not accurate, as well as adverse public or medical opinions about the health effects of consuming our products, could harm our business. Instances or reports, whether true or not, of unclean water supply or food-safety issues, such as food or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, adulteration, contamination or mislabeling, either during growing, manufacturing, packaging, storing or preparation, have in the past severely injured the reputations of companies in the food and beverage processing, grocery and quick-service restaurant sectors. Any report linking us to such instances could severely hurt our sales and could possibly lead to product liability claims, litigation (including class actions) and/or temporary store closures. Clean water is critical to the preparation of coffee, tea and other beverages, as well as ice for our cold beverages, and our ability to ensure adequate supplies of clean water and ice to our stores can be limited, particularly in some international locations. We are also continuing to incorporate more products in our food and beverage lineup that require freezing or refrigeration, which increases the risk of food safety related incidents if correct temperatures are not maintained due to mechanical malfunction or human error. We also face risk by relying on third-party food suppliers to provide and transport ingredients and finished products to our stores. While we monitor the operations of certain of these business partners, the product quality and service they deliver may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control and it may be difficult to detect contamination or other defects in these products. There is greater risk from those we do not monitor, or do not monitor as closely. Furthermore, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there are stricter health regulations and guidelines and increased public concern over food safety standards and controls. Potential food safety incidents, whether at our stores or involving our business partners, could lead to wide public exposure, which could materially harm our business. 13 Table of Contents Additionally, we are evolving our product lineup to include more local or smaller suppliers for some of our products who may not have as rigorous quality and safety systems and protocols as larger or more national suppliers, especially in light of the heightened safety protocols as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, instances of food or beverage-safety issues, even those involving solely the restaurants or stores of competitors or of suppliers or distributors (regardless of whether we use or have used those suppliers or distributors), could adversely affect our sales on a regional or global basis by resulting in negative publicity about us or the foodservice industry in general. A decrease in customer traffic as a result of food-safety concerns or negative publicity, or as a result of a temporary closure of any of our stores, product recalls, viral-contaminated food or beverage claims or other food or beverage-safety claims or litigation, could materially harm our business and results of operations. • We may not be successful in implementing important strategic initiatives or effectively managing growth, which may have an adverse impact on our business and financial results. There is no assurance that we will be able to implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations or that they will generate expected returns, which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results. These strategic initiatives, which include our profit-, people- and planet-positive visions, are designed to create growth, improve our results of operations and drive long-term shareholder value, and include: • being an employer of choice and investing in employees to deliver a superior customer experience; • building our leadership position around coffee; • driving convenience, brand engagement and digital relationships through our mobile, loyalty, delivery and digital capabilities both domestically and internationally; • simplifying store administrative tasks to allow store partners to better engage with customers; • increasing the scale of the Starbucks store footprint with disciplined global expansion and introducing flexible and unique store formats, including the accelerated development of alternative store formats (such as Starbucks ® Pickup stores, Starbucks Now stores and curbside pickup) especially in light of the COVID-19 pandemic; • adjusting rapidly to changing customer preferences and behaviors in light of the COVID-19 pandemic; • moving to a more licensed store model in some markets and a more company-owned model in other markets; • creating new occasions in stores across all dayparts with new product offerings, including our growing lunch food and beverage product lineup; • continuing the global growth of our Channel Development business through our supply, distribution and licensing agreements with Nestlé and other Channel Development business partners; • delivering continued growth in our cold beverage business; • working to address the potential effects of climate change and the sustainability of our business; and • reducing our operating costs, particularly general and administrative expenses. In addition to other factors listed in this risk factors section, factors that may adversely affect the successful implementation of these initiatives, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results, include the following: • imposition of additional taxes by jurisdictions, such as on certain types of beverages or based on number of employees; • construction cost increases associated with new store openings and remodeling of existing stores; delays in store openings for reasons beyond our control, such as potential shortages of materials and labor and delays in permits, or a lack of desirable real estate locations available for lease at reasonable rates, either of which could keep us from meeting annual store opening targets in the U.S. and internationally; • governmental regulations or other health guidelines concerning operations of stores, including due to the COVID-19 pandemic or other public health emergencies; • not successfully scaling our supply chain infrastructure as our product offerings increase and as we continue to expand, including our emphasis on a broad range of high-quality food offerings; • not successfully adapting to customer or market factors affecting our supply chain as we work to address sustainability and climate change; and • the deterioration in our credit ratings, which could limit the availability of additional financing and increase the cost of obtaining financing to fund our initiatives. 14 Table of Contents Effectively managing growth can be challenging, particularly as we expand in international markets where we must balance the need for flexibility and a degree of autonomy for local management against the need for consistency with our goals, policies and standards. If we are not successful in implementing our strategic initiatives, or, in the event we undertake large acquisitions, integrations and divestitures, we may be required to evaluate whether certain assets, including goodwill and other intangibles, have become impaired. In the event we record an impairment charge, it could have a material impact on our financial results. • Evolving consumer preferences and tastes may adversely affect our business. Our continued success depends on our ability to attract and retain customers. Our financial results could be adversely affected by a shift in consumer spending away from outside-the-home food and beverages (such as the disruption caused by online commerce that results in reduced foot traffic to “brick & mortar” retail stores); lack of customer acceptance of new products (including due to price increases necessary to cover the costs of new products or higher input costs), brands (such as the global expansion of the Starbucks brand) and platforms (such as features of our mobile technology, changes in our loyalty rewards programs and our delivery services initiatives); or customers reducing their demand for our current offerings as new products are introduced. In addition, some of our products contain caffeine, dairy products, sugar and other compounds and allergens, the health effects of which are the subject of public and regulatory scrutiny, including the suggestion of linkages to a variety of adverse health effects. Particularly in the U.S., there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks, including obesity, as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food and beverage products. While we have a variety of beverage and food items, including items that are coffee-free and have reduced calories, an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in our products, whether accurate or not, imposition of additional taxes on certain types of food and beverage components, or negative publicity or litigation arising from certain health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our beverages and food products and could materially harm our business and results of operations. Furthermore, our financial results have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in a disruption of customer routines, changes to employer “work-from-home” policies, reduced business and recreational travel and changes in consumer behavior and the ability or willingness to spend discretionary income on our products. • We may not be successful in our marketing, promotional and advertising plans and pricing strategies Our continued success depends in part on our ability to adjust our marketing, promotional and advertising plans and pricing strategy to respond quickly and effectively to shifting economic and competitive conditions as well as evolving customer preferences. We operate in a complex and costly marketing, promotional and advertising environment. Our marketing, promotional and advertising programs may not be successful in reaching our customers in the way we intend. Our success depends in part on whether the allocation of our advertising, promotional and marketing resources across different channels, including digital marketing, allows us to reach our customers effectively and efficiently, and in ways that are meaningful to them. If the advertising, promotional and marketing programs or our pricing strategies are not successful, or are not as successful as those of our competitors, our sales and market share could decrease. Finally, customers are focusing more on sustainability and the environmental impacts of operations. An inability to meet customer expectations with respect to these issues could adversely affect our financial results. Risks Related to Cybersecurity and Data Privacy • Failure to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain privacy and data protections laws and regulations may subject us to substantial negative financial consequences and civil or criminal penalties. Complex local, state, national, foreign and international laws and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer and other processing of personal data. These privacy and data protection laws and regulations are quickly evolving, with new or modified laws and regulations proposed and implemented frequently and existing laws and regulations subject to new or different interpretations and enforcement. In addition, our legal and regulatory obligations in jurisdictions outside the U.S. are subject to unexpected changes, including the potential for regulatory or other governmental entities to enact new or additional laws or regulations, to issue rulings that invalidate prior laws or regulations or to increase penalties significantly. Complying with these laws and regulations can be costly and can impede the development and offering of new products and services. For example, Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and the U.K. General Data Protection Regulation (which implements the GDPR into U.K. law), impose stringent data protection requirements and provide for significant penalties for noncompliance. Additionally, California enacted legislation, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). The CCPA requires, among other things, covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers and allows such consumers new abilities to opt-out of certain sales of personal data. The CCPA also provides for civil penalties for violations as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act, which was passed in November 2020 and is fully effective in January 2023, significantly modifies the CCPA. These modifications will require us to incur additional costs and expenses in our effort to comply. Virginia and Colorado recently 15 Table of Contents enacted similar data privacy legislation that will take effect in 2023, and several other states and countries are considering expanding or passing privacy laws in the near term. In June 2021, the European Commission finalized recommendations in relation to cross border data transfers and published new versions of the Standard Contractual Clauses. The new requirements will require us to incur costs and expenses in order to comply and may impact the transfer of personal data throughout our organization and to third parties. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or other obligations to which we may be subject relating to personal data, or to protect personal data from unauthorized access, use or other processing, could result in enforcement actions and regulatory investigations against us, claims for damages by customers and other affected individuals, fines, damage to our brand reputation, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial performance and business. • The unauthorized access, use, theft or destruction of customer or employee personal, financial or other data or of Starbucks proprietary or confidential information that is stored in our information systems or by third parties on our behalf could impact our reputation and brand and expose us to potential liability and loss of revenues. Many of our information technology systems (whether cloud-based or hosted in proprietary servers), including those used for our point-of-sale, web and mobile platforms, online and mobile payment systems, delivery services and rewards programs and administrative functions, contain personal, financial or other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and employees. Many of our information technology systems also contain Starbucks proprietary and other confidential information related to our business, such as business plans and product development initiatives and designs, and confidential information about third parties, such as licensees and business partners. Similar to many other retail companies and because of the prominence of our brand, we are consistently subject to attempts to compromise our information technology systems from both internal and external sources. The number and frequency of these attempts varies from year to year but could be exacerbated to some extent by an increase in our digital operations, including our efforts to comply with state and local mandates in response to COVID‑19. In addition, we provide some customer and employee data, as well as Starbucks proprietary information and other confidential information important to our business, to third parties where necessary to conduct our business, including licensees and business partners. Individuals performing work for Starbucks and such third parties also may possess some of this data, including on personally-owned digital devices. To the extent we, a third party or such an individual were to experience a breach of our or their information technology systems that results in the unauthorized access, theft, use, destruction or other compromises of customers’ or employees’ data or confidential information of the Company stored in or transmitted through such systems, including through cyber-attacks or other external or internal methods, it could result in a material loss of revenues from the potential adverse impact to our reputation and brand, a decrease in our ability to retain customers or attract new ones, the imposition of potentially significant costs (including loss of data or payment for recovery of data) and liabilities, loss of business, loss of business partners and licensees and the disruption to our supply chain, business and plans. Unauthorized access, theft, use, destruction or other compromises may occur through a variety of methods, including attacks using malicious code, those taking advantage of vulnerabilities in software, hardware or other infrastructure (including systems used by our supply chain), those using techniques aimed at convincing those with access to such data or information to share passwords or otherwise allow access through deceit or otherwise and those taking advance of inadequate account security practices. Such security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable U.S. and international privacy, cyber and other laws or trigger U.S. state data breach notification laws, and subject us to private consumer, business partner or licensee or securities litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings, any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability. Significant capital investments and other expenditures could also be required to investigate security incidents, remedy cybersecurity problems, recuperate lost data, prevent future compromises and adapt systems and practices to react to the changing threat environment. These include costs associated with notifying affected individuals and other agencies, additional security technologies, trainings, personnel, experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached. These costs, which could be material, could adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred, including by interfering with the pursuit of other important business strategies and initiatives, and may not meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to breach our information technology systems. Media or other reports of existing or perceived security vulnerabilities in our systems or those of our third-party business partners or service providers can also adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially impact our business. Additionally, the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyber-attacks and compromise information technology systems, as well as the sources and targets of these attacks, change frequently and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time. We continue to make significant investments in technology, third-party services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyber-attacks and to prevent or minimize breaches of our information technology systems or data loss, but these security measures cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches or data loss. 16 Table of Contents • We rely heavily on information technology in our operations and growth initiatives, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate and grow our business and could adversely affect our financial results. We rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations for numerous purposes including for administrative functions, point-of-sale processing and payment in our stores and online, management of our supply chain, Starbucks Cards, online business, delivery services, mobile technology, including mobile payments and ordering apps, reloads and loyalty functionality and various other processes and transactions, and many of these systems are interdependent on one another for their functionality. Additionally, the success of several of our initiatives to drive growth, including our ability to increase digital relationships with our customers to drive incremental traffic and spend, is highly dependent on our technology systems. Furthermore, due to the social distancing measures put in place as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we accelerated the transformation of our store portfolio by expanding convenience-led formats, which depend heavily on our mobile ordering capabilities. We also rely on third-party providers and platforms for some of these information technology systems and support. Additionally, our systems hardware, software and services provided by third-party service providers are not fully redundant within a market or across our markets. Although we have operational safeguards in place, they may not be effective in preventing the failure of these systems or platforms to operate effectively and be available. Such failures may be caused by various factors, including power outages, climate change-related impacts, catastrophic events, physical theft, computer and network failures, inadequate or ineffective redundancy, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or platforms, flaws in third-party software or services, errors or improper use by our employees or third party service providers, or a breach in the security of these systems or platforms, including through cyber-attacks such as those that result in the blockage of our or our third-party business partners’ or service providers’ systems and platforms and those discussed in more detail in this risk factors section. If our incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective and timely manner they could result in an interruption in our operations and could cause material negative impacts to our product availability and sales, the efficiency of our operations and our financial results. In addition, remediation of any problems with our systems could result in significant, unplanned expenses. Risks Related to Intellectual Property • We may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property or adequately ensure that we are not infringing the intellectual property of others, which could harm the value of our brand and our business. The success of our business depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets. We rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets, patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our brand and branded products. We have registered certain trademarks and have other trademark registrations pending in the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions. The trademarks that we currently use have not been registered in all of the countries outside of the U.S. in which we do business or may do business in the future and may never be registered in all of these countries. It may be costly and time consuming to protect our intellectual property, and the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the U.S. and foreign countries may not be adequate. In addition, the steps we have taken may not adequately ensure that we do not infringe the intellectual property of others, and third parties may claim infringement by us in the future. Any claim of infringement, whether or not it has merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation and harm our business. In addition, we cannot ensure that licensees will not take actions that hurt the value of our intellectual property. Risks Related to Labor and Supply Chain • Our reliance on key business partners may adversely affect our business and operations. The growth of our business relies on the ability of our licensee partners to implement our growth platforms and product innovations as well as on the degree to which we are able to enter into, maintain, develop and negotiate appropriate terms and conditions of, and enforce, commercial and other agreements and the performance of our business partners under such agreements. Our international licensees may face capital constraints or other factors that may limit the speed at which they are able to expand and develop in a certain market. Our Channel Development business is heavily reliant on Nestlé, which has the right to sell and distribute our packaged goods and foodservice products to retailers and operators, with few exceptions. If Nestlé fails to perform its distribution and marketing commitments under our agreements and/or fails to support, protect and grow our brand in Channel Development, our Channel Development business could be adversely impacted for a period of time, present long-term challenges to our brand, limit our ability to grow our Channel Development business and have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results. Additionally, the growth of our Channel Development business is in part dependent on the level of discretionary support provided by our retail and licensed store businesses. There are generally a relatively small number of licensee partners operating in specific markets. If they are not able to access sufficient funds or financing, or are otherwise unable or unwilling to successfully operate and grow their businesses it could 17 Table of Contents have a material adverse effect on our results in the markets. Our business partners may be materially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and may not have sufficient financial support and capital to remain financially solvent and may not have the ability to meet their development goals and targets. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our financial results have been and could continue in the future to be adversely affected by the disruption to the operations of our business partners, including licensee relationships, third-party manufacturers, distributors and retailers, through the effects of business and facilities closures, reductions in operating hours, social, economic, political or labor instability in affected areas, transportation delays, travel restrictions and changes in operating procedures, including for additional cleaning and safety protocols. • Increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities or decreases in the availability of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results. The availability and prices of coffee beans and other commodities are subject to significant volatility. We purchase, roast and sell high-quality whole bean arabica coffee beans and related coffee products. The high-quality arabica coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the “C” price. This premium depends upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and the amount of the premium can vary significantly. Increases in the “C” coffee commodity price increase the price of high-quality arabica coffee and also impact our ability to enter into fixed-price purchase commitments. We frequently enter into supply contracts whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore price, at which the base “C” coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established. The supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, such as weather, climate change, water supply quality and availability throughout the coffee production chain, natural disasters, crop disease and pests, general increase in farm inputs and costs of production, inventory levels, political and economic conditions and the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies. Speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices. For example, drought conditions in Brazil have and, given continued drought conditions, are predicted to continue to impact coffee prices. Because of the significance of coffee beans to our operations, combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities, increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. In addition, if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or due to a worldwide or regional shortage, we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee, which could have a material adverse impact on our business operations and financial performance. We also purchase significant amounts of dairy products, particularly fluid milk, to support the needs of our company-operated retail stores. Additionally, and although less significant to our operations than coffee or dairy, other commodities, including tea and those related to food and beverage inputs, such as cocoa, produce, baking ingredients, meats, eggs and energy, as well as the processing of these inputs, are important to our operations. Increases in the cost of dairy products and other commodities, or lack of availability, whether due to supply shortages, delays or interruptions in processing, or otherwise, especially in international markets, could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. Similarly, increases in the cost of, or lack of availability, whether due to supply shortages, delays or interruptions in the processing of plant-based alternatives could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. • Interruption of our supply chain could affect our ability to produce or deliver our products and could negatively impact our business and profitability. Any material interruption in our supply chain, such as material interruption of roasted coffee supply due to the casualty loss of any of our roasting plants, interruptions in service by our third-party logistic service providers or common carriers that ship goods within our distribution channels, trade restrictions, such as increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes or customs restrictions, pandemics, social or labor unrest, labor shortages, natural disasters or political disputes and military conflicts that cause a material disruption in our supply chain could have a negative material impact on our business and our profitability. Additionally, our food, beverage and other products are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners in our supply chain operations, and in certain cases are produced or sourced by our licensees directly. We rely on these suppliers to provide high quality products and to comply with applicable laws. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge as we increase our fresh and prepared food offerings, especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the U.S. and from countries or regions with diminished infrastructure, developing or failing economies or which are experiencing political instability or social unrest. For certain products, we may rely on one or very few suppliers. A supplier's failure to meet our standards, provide products in a timely and efficient manner, or comply with applicable laws is beyond our control. These issues could have a material negative impact on our business and profitability. 18 Table of Contents • Changes in the availability of and the cost of labor could adversely affect our business. Our business could be adversely impacted by increases in labor costs, including wages and benefits, which, in a retail business such as ours, are two of our most significant costs, both domestically and internationally, including those increases triggered by regulatory actions regarding wages, scheduling and benefits; increased health care and workers’ compensation insurance costs; increased wages and costs of other benefits necessary to attract and retain high quality employees with the right skill sets and increased wages, benefits and costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The growth of our business can make it increasingly difficult to locate and hire sufficient numbers of employees, to maintain an effective system of internal controls for a globally dispersed enterprise and to train employees worldwide to deliver a consistently high-quality product and customer experience, which could materially harm our business and results of operations. Furthermore, we have experienced, and could continue to experience, a shortage of labor for store positions, including due to concerns around COVID-19 and other factors, which could decrease the pool of available qualified talent for key functions. Such labor shortages could be further exacerbated by expanded COVID-19 vaccination requirements. In addition, our wages and benefits programs may be insufficient to attract and retain the best talent. Additionally, while the number of partners represented by unions is not significant, if a significant portion of our employees were to become unionized, our labor costs could increase and our business could be negatively affected by other requirements and expectations that could increase our costs, change our employee culture, decrease our flexibility and disrupt our business. Further, our responses to any union organizing efforts could negatively impact how our brand is perceived and have adverse effects on our business, including on our financial results. • The loss of key personnel or difficulties recruiting and retaining qualified personnel could adversely impact our business and financial results. Much of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of senior management personnel. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key senior management personnel could harm our business. Our success also depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of our retail store employees on whom we rely to give customers a superior in-store experience and elevate our brand. Accordingly, our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain high quality management personnel and other employees to work in and manage our stores, both domestically and internationally. Our ability to attract and retain corporate, retail and other personnel is also acutely impacted in certain international and domestic markets where the competition for a relatively small number of qualified employees is intense or in markets where large high-tech companies are able to offer more competitive salaries and benefits. Additionally, there is intense competition for qualified technology systems developers necessary to develop and implement new technologies for our growth initiatives, including increasing our digital relationships with customers. If we are unable to recruit, retain and motivate employees sufficiently to maintain our current business and support our projected growth, our business and financial performance may be adversely affected. 19 Table of Contents Risks Related to Competition • We face intense competition in each of our channels and markets, which could lead to reduced profitability. The specialty coffee market is intensely competitive, including with respect to product quality, innovation, service, convenience, such as delivery service and mobile ordering, and price, and we face significant and increasing competition in all of these areas in each of our channels and markets. Accordingly, we do not have leadership positions in all channels and markets. In the U.S., the ongoing focus by large competitors in the quick-service restaurant sector on selling high-quality specialty coffee beverages could lead to decreases in customer traffic to Starbucks ® stores and/or average value per transaction adversely affecting our sales and results of operations. Similarly, continued competition from well-established competitors, or competition from large new entrants or well-funded smaller companies, in our domestic and international markets could hinder growth and adversely affect our sales and results of operations in those markets. Many small competitors also continue to open coffee specialty stores in many of our markets across the world, which in the aggregate may also lead to significant decreases of customer traffic to our stores in those markets. Increased competition globally in packaged coffee and tea and single-serve and ready-to-drink coffee beverage markets, including from new and large entrants to this market, could adversely affect the profitability of the Channel Development segment. In addition, not all of our competitors may seek to establish environmental or sustainability goals at a comparable level to ours, which could result in lower supply chain or operating costs for our competitors. We may incur increased costs associated with reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, reducing the use of plastic or imposing performance obligations on our suppliers that could increase financial obligations for us and our business partners and could affect our profitability. Additionally, if we are unable to respond to consumer demand for healthy beverages and foods, or our competitors respond more effectively, this could have a negative effect on our business. Furthermore, declines in general consumer demand for specialty coffee products for any reason, including due to consumer preference for other products, flattening demand for our products, changed customer daily routines or traffic to stores as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, or changed customer spending behaviors due to challenging economic conditions, could have a negative effect on our business. Risks Related to Operating a Global Business • We are highly dependent on the financial performance of our North America operating segment. Our financial performance is highly dependent on our North America operating segment, which comprised approximately 70% of consolidated total net revenues in fiscal 2021. If the North America operating segment revenue trends slow or decline, or does not successfully recover in the post COVID-19 environment, especially in our U.S. market, our other segments may be unable to make up any significant shortfall and our business and financial results could be adversely affected. And because the North America segment is relatively mature and produces the large majority of our operating cash flows, such a slowdown or decline could result in reduced cash flows for funding the expansion of our international businesses and other initiatives and for returning cash to shareholders. • We are increasingly dependent on the success of certain international markets in order to achieve our growth targets. Our future growth increasingly depends on the growth and sustained profitability of certain international markets. Some or all of our international market business units (“MBUs”), which we generally define by the countries in which they operate, may not be successful in their operations or in achieving expected growth, which ultimately requires achieving consistent, stable net revenues and earnings. The performance of these international operations may be adversely affected by economic downturns in one or more of the countries in which our large MBUs operate. A decline in performance of one or more of our significant international MBUs could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results. The International segment is a significant profit center driving our global returns, along with our North America segment. In particular, our China MBU contributes meaningfully to both consolidated and International net revenues and operating income. China is currently our fastest growing market, our second largest market overall and 100% company-owned. Due to the significance of our China market for our profit and growth, we are exposed to risks in China, including the risks mentioned elsewhere and the following: • the effects of current U.S.-China relations, including rounds of tariff increases and retaliations and increasing restrictive regulations, potential boycotts and increasing anti-Americanism; • escalating U.S.-China tension and increasing political sensitivities in China; • the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental regulations and restrictions on our operations in China; • entry of new competitors to the specialty coffee market in China; • changes in economic conditions in China and potential negative effects to the growth of its middle class, wages, labor, inflation, discretionary spending and real estate and supply chain costs; 20 Table of Contents • ongoing government regulatory reform, including relating to public health, food safety, tariffs and tax, sustainability and responses to climate change, which result in regulatory uncertainty as well as potential significant increases in compliance costs; and • food-safety related matters, including compliance with food-safety regulations and ability to ensure product quality and safety. Additionally, some factors that will be critical to the success of our international operations overall are different than those affecting our U.S. stores and licensees. Tastes naturally vary by region, and consumers in some MBUs may not embrace our products to the same extent as consumers in the U.S. or other international markets. Occupancy costs and store operating expenses can be higher internationally than in the U.S. due to higher rents for prime store locations or costs of compliance with country-specific regulatory requirements. Because many of our international operations are in an early phase of development, operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues are often higher compared to more developed operations. • We face risks as a global business that could adversely affect our financial performance. We operate in 84 markets globally. Our international operations are also subject to additional inherent risks of conducting business abroad, such as: • foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, or requirements to transact in specific currencies; • changes or uncertainties in economic, legal, regulatory, social and political conditions in our markets, as well as negative effects on U.S. businesses due to increasing anti-American sentiment in certain markets; • interpretation and application of laws and regulations, including tax, tariffs, labor, merchandise, anti-bribery and privacy laws and regulations; • restrictive actions of foreign or U.S. governmental authorities affecting trade and foreign investment, especially during periods of heightened tension between the U.S. and such foreign governmental authorities, including protective measures such as export and customs duties and tariffs, government intervention favoring local competitors and restrictions on the level of foreign ownership; • import or other business licensing requirements; • the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights; • limitations on the repatriation of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions due to current or new U.S. and international regulations; • in developing economies, the growth rate in the portion of the population achieving sufficient levels of disposable income may not be as fast as we forecast; • difficulty in staffing, developing and managing foreign operations and supply chain logistics, including ensuring the consistency of product quality and service, due to governmental actions affecting supply chain logistics, distance, language and cultural differences, as well as challenges in recruiting and retaining high quality employees in local markets; • local laws that make it more expensive and complex to negotiate with, retain or terminate employees; • local regulations, health guidelines and safety protocols related to the COVID-19 pandemic affecting our operations; and • delays in store openings for reasons beyond our control, competition with locally relevant competitors or a lack of desirable real estate locations available for lease at reasonable rates, any of which could keep us from meeting annual store opening targets and, in turn, negatively impact net revenues, operating income and earnings per share. Moreover, many of the foregoing risks are particularly acute in developing countries, which are important to our long-term growth prospects. Risks Related to Governmental and Regulatory Changes • Failure to comply with applicable laws and changing legal and regulatory requirements could harm our business and financial results. Our policies and procedures are designed to comply with all applicable laws, accounting and reporting requirements, tax rules and other regulations and requirements, including those imposed by the SEC, Nasdaq and foreign countries, as well as applicable trade, labor, healthcare, food and beverage, sanitation, safety, environmental, labeling, anti-bribery and corruption and merchandise laws. Such laws and regulations are complex and often subject to differing interpretations, which can lead to unintentional or unknown instances of non-compliance. Changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations, including 21 Table of Contents increased or additional regulations and associated costs to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, to discourage the use of plastic or to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use, may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures, incremental investments and other financial obligations for us and our business partners, which could affect our profitability. Furthermore, due to the COVID‑19 pandemic, we are subject to additional domestic and foreign governmental regulations and health guidelines, as well as any other voluntary safety protocols. In addition, our business is subject to complex and rapidly evolving U.S. and international laws and regulations regarding data privacy and data protection, and companies are under increased regulatory scrutiny relating to these matters. The Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are also interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of data. The interpretation and application of existing laws and regulations regarding data privacy and data protection are in flux and authorities around the world are considering a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals in this area. Current and future data privacy and data protection laws and regulations (including the GDPR and the CCPA, discussed in more detail in this risk factors section, and other applicable international and U.S. privacy laws), or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may limit our ability to collect and use data, require us to otherwise modify our data processing practices and policies or result in the possibility of fines, litigation or orders, which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The burdens imposed by these and other laws and regulations that may be enacted, or new interpretations of existing and future laws and regulations, may also require us to incur substantial costs in reaching compliance in a manner adverse to our business. The complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related costs of compliance are both increasing due to additional or changing legal and regulatory requirements, our ongoing expansion into new markets and new channels and the fact that foreign laws occasionally conflict with domestic laws. In addition to potential damage to our reputation and brand, failure by us or our business partners to comply with the various applicable laws and regulations, as well as changes in laws and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied, may result in litigation, civil and criminal liability, damages, fines and penalties, increased cost of regulatory compliance and restatements of our financial statements and have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.

All references to store counts, including data for new store openings, are reported net of related store closures, unless otherwise noted. Fiscal year 2021 included 53 weeks, with the 53rd week falling in the fourth fiscal quarter. Fiscal years 2020 and 2019 included 52 weeks. For fiscal 2021, comparable store sales percentages were calculated excluding the extra week in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. The discussion of our financial condition and results of operations for the year ended September 29, 2019, included in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) can be found in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 27, 2020. The fiscal 2021 Latin America and Caribbean licensed store market resegmentation did not have a material impact to prior year North America and International operating segment business trends and operating margins. Overview In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, certain changes were made to our management team, and our operating segment reporting structure was realigned as a result. We realigned our fully licensed Latin America and Caribbean markets from our Americas operating segment to our International operating segment. Additionally, we renamed the Americas operating segment to the North America operating segment, since it is comprised of our company-operated and licensed stores in the U.S. and Canada. We also made certain other immaterial changes between our International operating segment and Corporate and Other. Concurrent with the change in reportable segments, we revised our prior period financial information to be consistent with the current period presentation. There was no impact on consolidated net revenues, total operating expenses, operating income or net earnings per share as a result of these changes. We have three reportable operating segments: 1) North America, which is inclusive of the U.S. and Canada; 2) International, which is inclusive of China, Japan, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean; and 3) Channel Development. Non-reportable operating segments such as Evolution Fresh and unallocated corporate expenses are reported within Corporate and Other. Our financial results and long-term growth model will continue to be driven by new store openings, comparable store sales and margin management. We believe these key operating metrics are useful to investors because management uses these metrics to assess the growth of our business and the effectiveness of our marketing and operational strategies. Throughout this MD&A, we commonly discuss the following key operating metrics: • New store openings and store count • Comparable store sales • Operating margin Starbucks results for fiscal 2021 demonstrate the overall strength and resilience of our brand. Consolidated revenues increased 24% to $29.1 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to $23.5 billion in fiscal 2020, primarily due to business recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Also contributing to the increase was $576 million of incremental revenue attributable to the extra week in fiscal 2021. For the North America segment, comparable store sales increased 22% for fiscal 2021 compared to a decline of 12% in fiscal 2020. Comparable store sales for our U.S. market increased 21% for fiscal 2021 compared to a decline of 12% in fiscal 2020. The U.S. market also had a 7% increase in two-year comparable store sales (1) . We lapped higher costs attributable to COVID-19 in the prior year, including catastrophe pay programs for company-operated store partners (employees), net of qualified tax credits provided by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) and the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (“CEWS”). In fiscal 2020, we announced a restructuring plan to optimize our North America store portfolio, primarily in dense, metropolitan markets, by blending store formats to better cater to changing customer tastes and preferences. As of the fiscal year ended October 3, 2021, we had substantially completed our restructuring plan, which resulted in the closure of 807 stores in the U.S. and Canada. Costs incurred related to the restructuring efforts were recorded as restructuring and impairments on our consolidated statements of earnings. In October 2021, we announced plans to deliver retail wage increases across the U.S. in fiscal 2022. This investment, combined with industry-leading benefits, supports Starbucks aspiration to remain an employer of choice that can attract and retain the high-quality talent necessary to support our continued growth. For the International segment, comparable store sales increased by 16% for fiscal 2021 compared to a decline of 19% in fiscal 2020. Comparable store sales for our China market increased 17%, inclusive of a 3% adverse impact from lapping the prior-year value-added tax (“VAT”) benefit. Key markets in the International segment continued to experience pandemic-related restrictions that significantly impacted customer mobility during the year. Although nearly all company-operated stores in these markets remained open, the modified operating protocols had an adverse impact to comparable store sales and operating results. 26 Table of Contents Revenue for our Channel Development segment decreased $331 million, or 17%, when compared with fiscal 2020. This was largely due to the transition of certain single-serve product activities to Nestlé beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. This was partially offset by growth in our ready-to-drink business. We expect Channel Development to return to more normalized reported revenue growth levels in fiscal 2022, as the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 is the last quarter lapping these transition related activities. During fiscal 2021, we began to experience certain supply shortages and transportation delays largely attributable to impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as changes in customer demand and behaviors. While we expect these shortages and delays may continue into fiscal 2022, we view them to be temporary and do not believe they will have a material impact to our long-term growth and profitability. Absent significant and prolonged COVID-19 relapses or global economic disruptions, and based on the current trend of our business operations and our focused efforts to elevate customer experiences, enhance digital capabilities and drive beverage innovation, we are confident in the strength of our brand and the durability of long-term “Growth at Scale” strategy to deliver consistent revenue and income growth. We anticipate the planned wage investment in the U.S., along with increased supply chain costs primarily related to inflationary pressures that began in the latter half of the fiscal year, will have an impact to operating margin in fiscal 2022. However, these should be meaningfully offset by benefits from pricing decisions and leverage from revenue growth and productivity efficiency. (1) Two-year comparable store sales metric is calculated as ((1 + % change in comparable store sales in FY20) * (1 + % change in comparable store sales in FY21)) - 1. Two-year comparable store sales for the U.S. of 7% = ((1 + (-12%)) * (1 + 21%)) - 1. Financial Highlights • Total net revenues increased 24% to $29.1 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to $23.5 billion in fiscal 2020, including $576 million attributable to the extra week in fiscal 2021. • Consolidated operating income increased to $4.9 billion in fiscal 2021 compared to $1.6 billion in fiscal 2020. Fiscal 2021 operating margin was 16.8% compared to 6.6% in fiscal 2020. Operating margin expansion was primarily due to sales leverage from business recovery and lapping higher COVID-19 related costs in the prior year, mainly catastrophe and service pay for store partners, net of temporary subsidies from the U.S. and certain foreign governments, as well as pricing in North America in the current year. These increases were partially offset by enhancements in retail store partner wages and benefits and, to a lesser extent, increased supply chain costs due to accelerated inflationary pressures in the latter half of fiscal 2021. • Diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) for fiscal 2021 increased to $3.54, compared to EPS of $0.79 in fiscal 2020. The increase was primarily driven by lapping the adverse impacts of COVID-19 in prior year. Also contributing to the increase was a $0.56 gain net of estimated taxes on the divestiture of our South Korea joint venture and $0.10 related to the extra week in fiscal 2021. • Capital expenditures were $1.5 billion for both fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020. • We returned $2.1 billion to our shareholders in fiscal 2021 through dividends. We returned $3.6 billion in fiscal 2020 through share repurchases and dividends. We temporarily suspended our share repurchase program in March 2020. Due to our business recovery and restoration of certain leverage metrics, we have resumed our share repurchase program in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.

The growth in company-operated store revenue was driven by a 20% increase in comparable store sales ($3.8 billion), attributable to a 9% increase in comparable transactions and a 10% increase in average ticket, the incremental revenues from 524 net new Starbucks ® company-operated store openings, or a 3% increase, over the past 12 months ($782 million), the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2021 ($496 million) and the impact of favorable foreign currency translation ($359 million). Licensed stores revenue of $357 million also contributed to the increase in total net revenues, driven by higher product and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($270 million), the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2021 ($57 million) and the impact of favorable foreign currency translation ($28 million). Other revenues decreased $256 million, primarily driven by the transition of certain single-serve product activities to Nestlé. Partially offsetting this decrease was growth in our ready-to-drink business ($43 million) and the impact of the extra fiscal week in fiscal 2021 ($23 million). Operating Expenses Fiscal Year Ended Oct 3, 2021 Sep 27, 2020 Oct 3, 2021 Sep 27, 2020 As a % of Total Net Revenues Product and distribution costs $ 8,738.7 $ 7,694.9 30.1 % 32.7 % Store operating expenses 11,930.9 10,764.0 41.1 45.8 Other operating expenses 359.5 430.3 1.2 1.8 Depreciation and amortization expenses 1,441.7 1,431.3 5.0 6.1 General and administrative expenses 1,932.6 1,679.6 6.7 7.1 Restructuring and impairments 170.4 278.7 0.6 1.2 Total operating expenses 24,573.8 22,278.8 84.6 94.7 Income from equity investees 385.3 322.5 1.3 1.4 Operating income $ 4,872.1 $ 1,561.7 16.8 % 6.6 % Store operating expenses as a % of related revenues 48.5 % 56.2 % Product and distribution costs as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 260 basis points, primarily due to sales leverage driven by lapping the severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the prior year and pricing in North America in the current year. These decreases were partially offset by increased supply chain costs due to accelerated inflationary pressures in the latter half of fiscal 2021. Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 470 basis points. Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues decreased 770 basis points, primarily due to sales leverage from business recovery and lapping higher COVID-19 related costs in the prior year, mainly catastrophe and service pay for store partners, net of temporary subsidies from the U.S. and certain foreign governments (approximately 190 basis points) and labor efficiencies (approximately 110 basis points). These decreases were partially offset by enhancements in retail store partner wages and benefits (approximately 140 basis points). 28 Table of Contents Other operating expenses decreased $71 million, primarily due to lower Global Coffee Alliance transaction costs, inclusive of lapping integration costs for the Global Coffee Alliance and a change of a related accrual estimate in fiscal 2021. Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased 110 basis points, primarily due to sales leverage. General and administrative expenses increased $253 million, primarily due to higher performance-based compensation, recognizing the strength of the Company's overall recovery from pandemic-related business impacts ($111 million), incremental strategic investments in technology ($89 million), increased partner wages and benefits ($26 million) and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2021 ($22 million). Restructuring and impairment expenses decreased $108 million, primarily due to lower asset impairment related to our North America store portfolio optimization ($65 million), lapping the intangible asset impairment from the prior year ($22 million) and lower severance costs. Income from equity investees increased $63 million, primarily due to higher income from our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture ($30 million) and growth in our South Korea joint venture prior to divestiture ($22 million). We expect lower income from equity method investments in the future as a result of the sale of our South Korea joint venture (see Note 2 ); however, we do not expect this transaction to have a material impact on future revenue and operating margin trends. The combination of these changes resulted in an overall increase in operating margin of 1,020 basis points in fiscal 2021 when compared to fiscal 2020. Other Income and Expenses Fiscal Year Ended Oct 3, 2021 Sep 27, 2020 Oct 3, 2021 Sep 27, 2020 As a % of Total Net Revenues Operating income $ 4,872.1 $ 1,561.7 16.8 % 6.6 % Net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations 864.5 — 3.0 — Interest income and other, net 90.1 39.7 0.3 0.2 Interest expense (469.8) (437.0) (1.6) (1.9) Earnings before income taxes 5,356.9 1,164.4 18.4 5.0 Income tax expense 1,156.6 239.7 4.0 1.0 Net earnings including noncontrolling interests 4,200.3 924.7 14.5 3.9 Net earnings/(loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 1.0 (3.6) — — Net earnings attributable to Starbucks $ 4,199.3 $ 928.3 14.5 % 3.9 % Effective tax rate including noncontrolling interests 21.6 % 20.6 % Net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations increased $865 million due to the sale of our ownership interest in our South Korea joint venture. Interest income and other, net increased $50 million, primarily due to additional income from certain investments and net favorable fair value adjustments from derivatives used to manage our commodity price fluctuation risk. Interest expense increased $33 million primarily due to additional interest incurred on long-term debt issued in March 2020 and May 2020. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 was 21.6% compared to 20.6% for fiscal 2020. The increase was due to the foreign rate differential on our jurisdictional mix of earnings (approximately 380 basis points) as well as higher pre-tax income in fiscal 2021, which resulted in lower rate benefits from several discrete items, including stock-based compensation excess tax benefits (approximately 380 basis points), the release of income tax reserves upon expiration of statute of limitations (approximately 150 basis points) and the remeasurement of deferred tax assets due to an enacted foreign corporate rate change (approximately 80 basis points). These unfavorable drivers were partially offset by lapping valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets of certain international jurisdictions in the prior year (approximately 990 basis points). See Note 14 , Income Taxes, for further discussion. 29 Table of Contents Segment Information Results of operations by segment (in millions) : North America (1) Fiscal Year Ended Oct 3, 2021 Sep 27, 2020 Oct 3, 2021 Sep 27, 2020 As a % of North America Total Net Revenues Net revenues: Company-operated stores $ 18,737.3 $ 14,778.8 91.6 % 90.7 % Licensed stores 1,702.2 1,509.9 8.3 9.3 Other 8.4 7.5 — — Total net revenues 20,447.9 16,296.2 100.0 100.0 Product and distribution costs 5,453.8 4,564.4 26.7 28.0 Store operating expenses 9,359.5 8,488.0 45.8 52.1 Other operating expenses 166.0 154.6 0.8 0.9 Depreciation and amortization expenses 753.9 762.0 3.7 4.7 General and administrative expenses 300.0 268.0 1.5 1.6 Restructuring and impairments 155.4 257.5 0.8 1.6 Total operating expenses 16,188.6 14,494.5 79.2 88.9 Operating income $ 4,259.3 $ 1,801.7 20.8 % 11.1 % (1) North America licensed store revenues, total net revenues, product and distribution costs, other operating expenses, total operating expenses and operating income for the fiscal year ended September 27, 2020, have been restated to conform with current period presentation. Revenues North America total net revenues for fiscal 2021 increased $4.2 billion, or 25%, primarily due to a 22% increase in comparable store sales ($3.1 billion) driven by a 13% increase in average ticket and a 7% increase in transactions and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2021 ($427 million). Also contributing to these increases were the performance of new stores compared to the closure of underperforming stores, including stores related to our restructuring plan ($394 million), higher product and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($151 million) primarily due to lapping the severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the prior year and favorable foreign currency translation ($76 million). Operating Margin North America operating income for fiscal 2021 increased 136% to $4.3 billion, compared to $1.8 billion in fiscal 2020. Operating margin increased 970 basis points to 20.8%, primarily due to sales leverage from business recovery and lapping higher COVID-19 related costs in the prior year, mainly catastrophe and service pay for store partners, net of temporary subsidies provided by the CARES Act and CEWS (approximately 180 basis points). Also contributing to the margin improvements were pricing (approximately 130 basis points), lower restructuring expenses (approximately 80 basis points) and benefits from the closure of lower-performing stores (approximately 60 basis points). These increases were partially offset by enhancements in retail store partner wages and benefits (approximately 150 basis points) and, to a lesser extent, increased supply chain costs due to accelerated inflationary pressures in the latter half of fiscal 2021. 30 Table of Contents International (1) Fiscal Year Ended Oct 3, 2021 Sep 27, 2020 Oct 3, 2021 Sep 27, 2020 As a % of International Total Net Revenues Net revenues: Company-operated stores $ 5,869.7 $ 4,385.8 84.8 % 83.8 % Licensed stores 981.4 817.2 14.2 15.6 Other 70.5 27.6 1.0 0.5 Total net revenues 6,921.6 5,230.6 100.0 100.0 Product and distribution costs 2,187.3 1,729.1 31.6 33.1 Store operating expenses 2,571.4 2,276.0 37.2 43.5 Other operating expenses 147.3 153.6 2.1 2.9 Depreciation and amortization expenses 544.7 518.4 7.9 9.9 General and administrative expenses 360.5 286.4 5.2 5.5 Restructuring and impairments — (1.2) — — Total operating expenses 5,811.2 4,962.3 84.0 94.9 Income from equity investees 135.3 102.3 2.0 2.0 Operating income $ 1,245.7 $ 370.6 18.0 % 7.1 % (1) International licensed store revenues, total net revenues, product and distribution costs, other operating expenses, general and administrative expenses, total operating expenses and operating income for the fiscal year ended September 27, 2020, have been restated to conform with current period presentation. Revenues International total net revenues for fiscal 2021 increased $1.7 billion, or 32%, primarily due to a 16% increase in comparable store sales ($697 million), driven by a 14% increase in transactions and a 1% increase in average ticket. Also contributing to this increase were 746 net new Starbucks ® company-operated stores, or an 11% increase, over the past 12 months ($388 million). Additionally, there was favorable foreign currency translation ($310 million), the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2021 ($127 million) and higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($121 million) primarily due to lapping the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the prior year. Operating Margin International operating income for fiscal 2021 increased 236% to $1.2 billion, compared to $371 million in fiscal 2020. Operating margin increased 1,090 basis points to 18.0%, primarily due to sales leverage driven by lapping the severe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the prior year as well as higher temporary government subsidies (approximately 170 basis points) and labor efficiencies (approximately 110 basis points). Also contributing to this increase was lapping temporary royalty relief provided to licensees in the prior year (approximately 60 basis points). 31 Table of Contents Channel Development Fiscal Year Ended Oct 3, 2021 Sep 27, 2020 Oct 3, 2021 Sep 27, 2020 As a % of Channel Development Total Net Revenues Net revenues $ 1,593.6 $ 1,925.0 Product and distribution costs 1,011.2 1,338.1 63.5 69.5 Other operating expenses 31.3 108.2 2.0 5.6 Depreciation and amortization expenses 1.2 1.2 0.1 0.1 General and administrative expenses 10.8 10.5 0.7 0.5 Total operating expenses 1,054.5 1,458.0 66.2 75.7 Income from equity investees 250.0 220.2 15.7 11.4 Operating income $ 789.1 $ 687.2 49.5 % 35.7 % Revenues Channel Development total net revenues for fiscal 2021 decreased $331 million, or 17%, compared to fiscal 2020, primarily due to the transition of certain single-serve product activities to Nestlé ($348 million) and the lapping of higher transition activities related to the Global Coffee Alliance in the prior year ($85 million). These were partially offset by growth in our ready-to-drink business ($52 million) and the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2021 ($21 million). Operating Margin Channel Development operating income for fiscal 2021 increased 15% to $789 million, compared to $687 million in fiscal 2020. Operating margin increased 1,380 basis points to 49.5%, primarily due to the transfer of certain single-serve product activities to Nestlé as part of the Global Coffee Alliance (approximately 730 basis points) and lapping higher transition costs for the Global Coffee Alliance and a change in estimate relating to a transaction cost accrual in fiscal 2021 (approximately 380 basis points). Strong performance from our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture (approximately 120 basis points) also contributed. 32 Table of Contents Corporate and Other (1) Fiscal Year Ended Oct 3, 2021 Sep 27, 2020 % Change Net revenues: Other $ 97.5 $ 66.2 47.3 % Total net revenues 97.5 66.2 47.3 Product and distribution costs 86.4 63.3 36.5 Other operating expenses 14.9 13.9 7.2 Depreciation and amortization expenses 141.9 149.7 (5.2) General and administrative expenses 1,261.3 1,114.7 13.2 Restructuring and impairments 15.0 22.4 (33.0) Total operating expenses 1,519.5 1,364.0 11.4 Operating loss $ (1,422.0) $ (1,297.8) 9.6 % (1) Corporate and other general and administrative expenses and operating loss for the fiscal year ended September 27, 2020, have been restated to conform with current period presentation. Corporate and Other primarily consists of our unallocated corporate expenses and Evolution Fresh. Unallocated corporate expenses include corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments. Corporate and Other operating loss increased to $1.4 billion for fiscal 2021, or 10%, compared to $1.3 billion in fiscal 2020. This increase was primarily driven by incremental investments in technology ($81 million) and higher performance-based compensation, due to better than expected business recovery ($57 million). FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash and Investment Overview Our cash and investments were $6.9 billion and $4.8 billion as of October 3, 2021 and September 27, 2020, respectively. We actively manage our cash and investments in order to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, make acquisitions and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases. Our investment portfolio primarily includes highly liquid available-for-sale securities, including corporate debt securities, government treasury securities (domestic and foreign) and commercial paper. As of October 3, 2021, approximately $2.9 billion of cash was held in foreign subsidiaries. Borrowing capacity Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Our total contractual borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes was $3.0 billion as of the end of fiscal 2021. Revolving Lines of Credit During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we replaced our $2.0 billion unsecured 5-year revolving credit facility (the “2018 credit facility”) and our $1.0 billion unsecured 364-Day credit facility (the “364-day credit facility”) with a new $3.0 billion unsecured 5-year revolving credit facility (the “2021 credit facility”). Our 2021 credit facility, of which $150 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit, is currently set to mature on September 16, 2026. We have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $1.0 billion. Borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR, and, for U.S. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on the Company’s long-term credit ratings assigned by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s rating agencies. The 2021 credit facility contains alternative interest rate provisions specifying rate calculations to be used at such time LIBOR ceases to be available as a benchmark due to reference rate reform. The “Base Rate” of interest is the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.025%, (ii) Bank of America’s prime rate, and (iii) the Eurocurrency Rate (as defined in the credit facility) plus 1.025%. The 2021 credit facility is available for general corporate purposes. As of October 3, 2021, we had no borrowings under the 2021 credit facility. Commercial Paper 33 Table of Contents Under our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion, with individual maturities that may vary but not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. Amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program are required to be backstopped by available commitments under the 2021 credit facility discussed above. The proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper program may be used for working capital needs, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, business expansion, payment of cash dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. As of October 3, 2021, we had no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program. Credit Facilities in Japan Additionally, we hold Japanese yen-denominated credit facilities which are available for working capital needs and capital expenditures within our Japanese market. • A ¥5 billion, or $44.9 million, facility is currently set to mature on December 30, 2021. Borrowings under the credit facility are subject to terms defined within the facility and will bear interest at a variable rate based on TIBOR plus an applicable margin of 0.400%. • A ¥10 billion, or $89.9 million, facility is currently set to mature on March 26, 2022. Borrowings under the credit facility are subject to terms defined within the facility and will bear interest at a variable rate based on TIBOR plus 0.350%. As of October 3, 2021, we had no borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities. See Note 9 , Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for details of the components of our long-term debt. Our ability to incur new liens and conduct sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties is subject to compliance with terms of the indentures under which the long-term notes were issued. As of October 3, 2021, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. Use of Cash We expect to use our available cash and investments, including, but not limited to, additional potential future borrowings under the credit facilities, commercial paper program and the issuance of debt to support and invest in our core businesses, including investing in new ways to serve our customers and supporting our store partners, repaying maturing debts, as well as returning cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and discretionary share repurchases and investing in new business opportunities related to our core and developing businesses. Further, we may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our investees. We may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business in support of our “Growth at Scale” agenda. Acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our investees. Any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy. We believe that net future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and investments both domestically and internationally combined with our ability to leverage our balance sheet through the issuance of debt will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses as well as shareholder distributions for the foreseeable future. However, significant new joint ventures, acquisitions and/or other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding. We have borrowed funds and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates; however, additional borrowings would result in increased interest expense in the future. In this regard, we may incur additional debt, within targeted levels, as part of our plans to fund our capital programs, including cash returns to shareholders through future dividends and discretionary share repurchases. If necessary, we may pursue additional sources of financing, including both short-term and long-term borrowings and debt issuances. We regularly review our cash positions and our determination of partial indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings. In the event we determine that all or another portion of such foreign earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested, we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes, which could be material. We currently do not anticipate the need for repatriated funds to the U.S. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs. See Note 14 , Income Taxes, for further discussion. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we replaced our $2.0 billion 2018 credit facility and our $1.0 billion 364-day credit facility with a new $3.0 billion 2021 credit facility. The 2021 credit facility was not drawn on in fiscal 2021 and is currently set to mature on September 16, 2026. During each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2020, we declared a cash dividend to shareholders of $0.41 per share. On September 30, 2020, and for each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2021, we declared a cash dividend of $0.45 per share. Dividends are generally paid in the quarter following the declaration date. Cash returned to shareholders through dividends in 34 Table of Contents fiscal 2021 and 2020 totaled $2.1 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we declared a cash dividend of $0.49 per share to be paid on November 26, 2021, with an expected payout of approximately $578.1 million. In March 2019, we entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements (“ASR agreements”) with third-party financial institutions totaling $2.0 billion, effective March 22, 2019. We made a $2.0 billion up-front payment to the financial institutions and received an initial delivery of 22.2 million shares of our common stock. In June 2019, we received an additional 3.9 million shares upon the completion of the program based on a volume-weighted average share price (less discount) of $76.50. Outside of the ASR agreements noted above, we repurchased 36.6 million shares of common stock for $3.1 billion on the open market during the fiscal year ended September 29, 2019. In total, we repurchased 139.6 million shares at a total cost of $10.1 billion for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2019. Our Board of Directors approved an increase of 120 million and 40 million shares to our ongoing share repurchase program during the fiscal first quarter of 2019 and fiscal second quarter of 2020, respectively. We temporarily suspended our share repurchase program in March 2020. Prior to the suspension, we repurchased 20.3 million shares of common stock for $1.7 billion on the open market during the year ended September 27, 2020. As of October 3, 2021, 48.9 million shares remained available for repurchase under current authorizations. Due to our business recovery and restoration of certain leverage metrics, we have resumed our share repurchase program in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Other than operating expenses, cash requirements for fiscal 2022 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for investments in our new and existing stores, our supply chain and corporate facilities. Total capital expenditures for fiscal 2022 are expected to be approximately $2 billion. The following table summarizes current and long-term material cash requirements as of October 3, 2021, which we expect to fund primarily with operating cash flows ( in millions ): Material Cash Requirements Total Less than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years More than 5 Years Operating lease obligations (1) $ 10,129.9 $ 1,504.6 $ 2,751.5 $ 2,169.1 $ 3,704.7 Debt obligations Principal payments 14,713.8 1,000.0 2,513.8 1,750.0 9,450.0 Interest payments 6,639.0 457.1 840.7 730.1 4,611.1 Purchase obligations (2) 1,800.2 1,202.6 533.9 63.7 — Other obligations (3) 368.4 54.6 92.6 136.5 84.7 Total $ 33,651.3 $ 4,218.9 $ 6,732.5 $ 4,849.4 $ 17,850.5 (1) Amounts include direct lease obligations, excluding any taxes, insurance and other related expenses. (2) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on Starbucks and that specify all significant terms. Green coffee purchase commitments comprise 96% of total purchase obligations. (3) Other obligations include other long-term liabilities primarily consisting of long-term income taxes payable, asset retirement obligations and equity investment capital commitments. Cash Flows Cash provided by operating activities was $6.0 billion for fiscal 2021, compared to $1.6 billion for fiscal 2020. The change was primarily due to higher net earnings and lapping the U.S. federal tax payment related to the Nestlé transaction in fiscal 2020. Cash used in investing activities totaled $0.3 billion for fiscal 2021, compared to $1.7 billion for fiscal 2020. The change was primarily driven by net proceeds from the divestiture of our ownership interest in our South Korea joint venture and higher maturities and calls of investments. This was partially offset by a decrease in sales of investments and higher capital contributions to equity method investments. Cash used in financing activities for fiscal 2021 totaled $3.7 billion, compared to cash provided by financing activities of $1.7 billion for fiscal 2020. The change was primarily due to lower net proceeds from borrowing activities and higher debt repayments, partially offset by the temporary suspension of our share repurchase program. 35 Table of Contents COMMODITY PRICES, AVAILABILITY AND GENERAL RISK CONDITIONS Commodity price risk represents Starbucks primary market risk, generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products, among other items. We purchase, roast and sell high-quality arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. In addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our company-operated stores. The price and availability of these commodities directly impacts our results of operations, and we expect commodity prices, particularly coffee, to impact future results of operations. For additional details see Product Supply in Item 1 , as well as Risk Factors in Item 1A of this 10-K. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT Market risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity security prices and interest rates. We manage our exposure to various market-based risks according to a market price risk management policy. Under this policy, market-based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies, such as entering into hedging transactions. The market price risk management policy governs how hedging instruments may be used to mitigate risk. Risk limits are set annually and prohibit speculative trading activity. We also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk, which we consider to be low. We use interest rate swap agreements and treasury locks to primarily hedge against changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances. We also use cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange debt instruments to hedge against changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt and foreign exchange exposure of net investments in Japan. Excluding interest rate hedging instruments, cross currency swaps and foreign currency debt, hedging instruments generally do not have maturities in excess of three years. Refer to Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 3 , Derivative Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion of our hedging instruments. The sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited, point-in-time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed. The actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses. Commodity Price Risk We purchase commodity inputs, primarily coffee, dairy products, diesel, cocoa, sugar and other commodities, that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results. We use a combination of pricing features embedded within supply contracts, such as fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed contracts for coffee purchases, and financial derivatives to manage our commodity price risk exposure. The following table summarizes the potential impact as of October 3, 2021 to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income (“OCI”) from changes in commodity prices. The information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items (in millions) : Increase/(Decrease) to Net Earnings Increase/(Decrease) to OCI 10% Increase in Underlying Rate 10% Decrease in Underlying Rate 10% Increase in Underlying Rate 10% Decrease in Underlying Rate Commodity hedges $ — $ — $ 53 $ (53) Foreign Currency Exchange Risk The majority of our revenue, expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the U.S., we have transactions in other currencies, primarily the Chinese renminbi, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, British pound, South Korean won and euro. To reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations, we enter into derivative instruments to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated intercompany royalty payments, inventory purchases, intercompany borrowing and lending activities and certain other transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity that enters into the arrangements, as well as the translation risk of certain balance sheet items. The volatility in the foreign exchange market may lead to significant fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates and adversely impact our financial results in the case of weakening foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. 36 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the potential impact as of October 3, 2021 to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due to a change in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign exchange rates. The information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items ( in millions ): Increase/(Decrease) to Net Earnings Increase/(Decrease) to OCI 10% Increase in Underlying Rate 10% Decrease in Underlying Rate 10% Increase in Underlying Rate 10% Decrease in Underlying Rate Foreign currency hedges $ 43 $ (43) $ 139 $ (139) Equity Security Price Risk We have minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds and equity exchange-traded funds within our marketable equity securities portfolio. Marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value and approximates a portion of our liability under our Management Deferred Compensation Plan (“MDCP”). Gains and losses from the portfolio and the change in our MDCP liability are recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings. We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of October 3, 2021 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments. Interest Rate Risk Long-term Debt We utilize short-term and long-term financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage our overall interest expense related to our existing fixed-rate debt, as well as to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances. See Note 3 , Derivative Financial Instruments and Note 9 , Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion of our interest rate hedge agreements and details of the components of our long-term debt, respectively, as of October 3, 2021. The following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates as of October 3, 2021 on the fair value of Starbucks debt (in millions) : Change in Fair Value Fair Value 100 Basis Point Increase in Underlying Rate 100 Basis Point Decrease in Underlying Rate Long-term debt (1) $ 16,014 $ 1,216 $ (1,216) (1) Amount disclosed is net of $13 million change in the fair value of our designated interest rate swap. Refer to Note 3 , Derivative Financial Instruments, for additional information on our interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge. Available-for-Sale Debt Securities Our available-for-sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of investment-grade debt securities. The primary objective of these investments is to preserve capital and liquidity. Available-for-sale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. We do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our investments. We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our available-for-sale securities as of October 3, 2021 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Critical accounting estimates are those that management believes are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain, especially in light of the current economic environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Judgments and uncertainties may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Our significant accounting estimates are discussed in additional detail in Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. We consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. During the past five fiscal years, we have not made any material changes to the accounting methodologies used to assess the areas discussed below, unless noted otherwise. We believe that our significant accounting estimates involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity for the reasons discussed below: 37 Table of Contents Property, Plant and Equipment and Other Finite-Lived Assets We evaluate property, plant and equipment, operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and other finite-lived assets for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. When evaluating for impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis and is depreciated over the asset's remaining useful life. Long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For company-operated store assets, the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level, which is inclusive of property, plant and equipment and lease ROU assets. The fair value of a store’s assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. For other long-lived assets, fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances, which may include discounted cash flows, comparable transactions or comparable company analyses. Our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values. Key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values include projected revenue growth and operating expenses, as well as forecasting asset useful lives and selecting an appropriate discount rate. For company-operated stores, estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider the store’s historical performance, the local market economics and the business environment impacting the store’s performance. The discount rate is selected based on what we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store. The fair value of a store’s ROU asset is estimated considering what a market participant would pay to lease the asset for its highest and best use. These estimates are subjective and our ability to realize future cash flows and asset fair values is affected by factors such as ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets, changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance. In fiscal 2020, we announced a restructuring plan to optimize our North America store portfolio, primarily in dense metropolitan markets, by developing new store formats to better cater to changing customer tastes and preferences. As of October 3, 2021, 807 stores in the U.S. and Canada were identified for closure, and substantially all were closed under the plan. During fiscal years 2021 and 2020, we recorded approximately $155.4 million and $254.7 million, respectively, to restructuring and impairments on our consolidated statements of earnings. These totals included $53.1 million and $151.0 million, respectively, related to impairment and disposition of company-operated store assets and $89.5 million and $87.7 million, respectively, primarily associated with accelerated amortization of ROU lease assets and other lease costs due to store closures prior to the end of contractual lease terms. We expect total future restructuring costs under this plan, which are attributable to our North America segment, to be immaterial. Asset impairment charges are discussed in Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets We evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate impairment may exist. When evaluating these assets for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit using discounted cash flows or a combination of discounted cash flow and market approaches. When assessing goodwill for impairment, our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment for an individual reporting unit is influenced by a number of factors, inclusive of the carrying value of the reporting unit’s goodwill, the significance of the excess of the reporting unit’s estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date, the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments and the date of acquisition. If we perform a quantitative assessment of an individual reporting unit’s goodwill, our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment when estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, including projected revenue growth and operating expenses related to existing businesses, product innovation and new store concepts, as well as utilizing valuation multiples of similar publicly traded companies and selecting an appropriate discount rate. Estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering the reporting unit’s past performance and forecasted growth, including assumptions regarding business recovery post COVID-19, strategic initiatives, local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit’s performance. The discount rate is selected based 38 Table of Contents on the estimated cost of capital for a market participant to operate the reporting unit in the region. These estimates, as well as the selection of comparable companies and valuation multiples used in the market approaches are highly subjective, and our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion. Our goodwill impairment assessments were not significantly altered as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to believe the fair value of each of our reporting units is significantly in excess of its carrying value, and absent a sustained multi-year global decline in our business in key markets such as the U.S. and China, we do not anticipate incurring significant goodwill impairment in the next 12 months. Our fiscal 2021 annual goodwill impairment testing, which was completed in the third fiscal quarter, resulted in an estimated fair value of our reporting units where a quantitative assessment was performed, was in excess of carrying value of approximately $74 billion. When assessing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, where we perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate if changes in events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that impairment may exist. If we do not perform a qualitative impairment assessment or if changes in events and circumstances indicate that a quantitative assessment should be performed, management is required to calculate the fair value of the intangible asset group. The fair value calculation includes estimates of revenue growth, which are based on past performance and internal projections for the intangible asset group’s forecasted growth, including assumptions regarding business recovery post COVID-19, and royalty rates, which are adjusted for our particular facts and circumstances. The discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital that reflects the risk profile of the related business. These estimates are highly subjective, and our ability to achieve the forecasted cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion. We do not anticipate recording significant impairment charges in the next 12 months. Definite-lived intangible asset impairment charges are discussed in Note 8 , Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. Income Taxes We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. We routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and results of operations. In projecting future taxable income, we consider historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal and foreign pre-tax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. Our assumptions regarding future taxable income are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income/(loss). In addition, our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include review of our tax filing positions, such as the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions. We evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of our position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. For uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold, we record a related liability. We adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available. As discussed in Note 14 , Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, we do not expect a significant amount of the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits to be recognized by the end of fiscal 2022 for reasons such as a lapse of the statute of limitations or resolution of examinations with tax authorities . We have generated income in certain foreign jurisdictions that may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes. We regularly review our plans for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings. The possibility exists that foreign earnings declared as indefinitely reinvested may be repatriated as our plans are based on our estimated working and other capital needs in jurisdictions where our earnings are generated. While we do not expect to repatriate cash to the U.S. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs, if these amounts were distributed to the U.S., in the form of dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes, which could be material. 39 Table of Contents Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. Deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation, the status of various income tax audits and our particular facts and circumstances. Although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results, including forecasted business performance could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected.

CORPORATION NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS Fiscal Years ended October 3, 2021, September 27, 2020 and September 29, 2019 Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates Description of Business We purchase and roast high-quality coffees that we sell, along with handcrafted coffee and tea beverages and a variety of fresh and prepared food items, through our company-operated stores. We also sell a variety of coffee and tea products and license our trademarks through other channels such as licensed stores, grocery and foodservice. The grocery and foodservice business is primarily through our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestlé established in August 2018. In this 10-K, Starbucks Corporation (together with its subsidiaries) is referred to as “Starbucks,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our.” Segment information is prepared on the same basis that our management reviews financial information for operational decision-making purposes. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, certain changes were made to our management team, and our operating segment reporting structure was realigned as a result. We realigned our fully licensed Latin America and Caribbean markets from our Americas operating segment to our International operating segment. We renamed the Americas operating segment to the North America operating segment, since it is comprised of our company-operated and licensed stores in the U.S. and Canada. We also made certain other immaterial changes between our International operating segment and Corporate and Other. Certain prior period information for our North America and International operating segments and our Corporate and Other reportable segment has been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. There was no impact on consolidated net revenues, total operating expenses, operating income or net earnings per share as a result of these changes. We have three reportable operating segments: 1) North America, which is inclusive of the U.S. and Canada; 2) International, which is inclusive of China, Japan, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East and Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean; and 3) Channel Development. Non-reportable operating segments such as Evolution Fresh and unallocated corporate expenses are reported within Corporate and Other. Additional details on the nature of our business and our reportable operating segments are included in Note 17 , Segment Reporting. Principles of Consolidation Our consolidated financial statements reflect the financial position and operating results of Starbucks, including wholly-owned subsidiaries and investees that we control. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Fiscal Year End Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. Fiscal year 2021 included 53 weeks, with the 53rd week falling in the fourth fiscal quarter. Fiscal years 2020 and 2019 included 52 weeks. Estimates and Assumptions Preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Examples include, but are not limited to, estimates for inventory reserves, asset and goodwill impairments, assumptions underlying self-insurance reserves, income from unredeemed stored value cards, stock-based compensation forfeiture rates, future asset retirement obligations and the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements. Actual results and outcomes may differ from these estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties, including uncertainty in the current economic environment due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. Restructuring In fiscal 2020, we announced a restructuring plan to optimize our North America store portfolio, primarily in dense metropolitan markets by developing new store formats to better cater to changing customer tastes and preferences. As of October 3, 2021, 807 stores in the U.S. and Canada had been identified for closure, and substantially all were closed under the plan. During fiscal years 2021 and 2020, we recorded approximately $ 155.4 million and $ 254.7 million, respectively, to restructuring and impairments on our consolidated statements of earnings. These totals included $ 53.1 million and $ 151.0 million, respectively, related to disposal and impairment of company-operated store assets and $ 89.5 million and $ 87.7 million, respectively, primarily associated with accelerated amortization of ROU lease assets and other lease costs due to store closures prior to the end of contractual lease terms. Company-operated store asset impairments were the result of either a triggering event that occurred where the assets were determined not to be recoverable or the store was permanently closed. For impaired store asset groups, we estimated the fair values using an income approach incorporating internal projections of 47 Table of Contents revenue growth and operating expenses that are considered Level 3 fair value measurements as well as applicable discount rates and market lease rates. The application of these projections and fair value measurements did not have a significant impact on our final impairment charges given that we have closed substantially all of these identified stores. As of October 3, 2021, we expect total future restructuring costs under this plan, which are attributable to our North America segment, to be immaterial. Restructuring-related accrued employee termination costs included in accrued payroll and benefits on the consolidated balance sheets were immaterial as of October 3, 2021 and September 27, 2020. Additionally on the consolidated balance sheets, other accrued restructuring costs included in accrued liabilities were immaterial as of October 3, 2021 and there were no other accrued restructuring costs outstanding as of September 27, 2020. Cash payments relating to these liabilities were immaterial for the fiscal years ended October 3, 2021 and September 27, 2020. Cash and Cash Equivalents We consider all highly liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase, as well as credit card receivables for sales to customers in our company-operated stores that generally settle within two to five business days, to be cash equivalents. We maintain cash and cash equivalent balances with financial institutions that exceed federally-insured limits. We have not experienced any losses related to these balances, and we believe credit risk to be minimal. Our cash management system provides for the funding of all major bank disbursement accounts on a daily basis as checks are presented for payment. Under this system, outstanding checks are in excess of the cash balances at certain banks, which creates book overdrafts. Book overdrafts are presented as a current liability in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Investments Available-for-sale Debt Securities Our short-term and long-term investments consist primarily of investment-grade debt securities, all of which are classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair value, and unrealized holding gains and losses are recorded, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Available-for-sale securities with remaining maturities of less than one year and those identified by management at the time of purchase to be used to fund operations within one year are classified as short-term. All other available-for-sale securities are classified as long-term. We evaluate our available-for-sale securities for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. Unrealized losses are charged against net earnings when a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary. We review several factors to determine whether a loss is other than temporary, such as the length and extent of the fair value decline, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and whether we have the intent to sell or will more likely than not be required to sell before the securities' anticipated recovery, which may be at maturity. Realized gains and losses are accounted for using the specific identification method. Purchases and sales are recorded on a trade date basis. Marketable Equity Securities We also have a marketable equity securities portfolio, which is comprised of marketable equity mutual funds and equity exchange-traded funds. Marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value and approximates a portion of our liability under our Management Deferred Compensation Plan (“MDCP”). Gains or losses from the portfolio and the change in our MDCP liability are recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings. Equity Investments Equity investments are accounted for under the equity method if we are able to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. Our share of the earnings or losses as reported by the investees is classified as income from equity investees on our consolidated statements of earnings. The investments are evaluated for impairment annually and when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. We account for equity investments for which we do not have significant influence and without readily determinable fair values at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments as permitted by the measurement alternative. Investments for which the measurement alternative has been elected are assessed for impairment quarterly, or if a triggering event indicates impairment may be present. Any adjustments as a result of price changes or impairments are recorded in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. Fair Value Fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability (exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants. For assets and liabilities recorded or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis, we determine fair value based on the following: 48 Table of Contents Level 1: The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. For equity and U.S. government treasury securities and commodity futures contracts, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets to determine fair value. Level 2: When quoted prices in active markets for identical assets are not available, we determine the fair value of our available-for-sale securities and our over-the-counter forward contracts, collars and swaps based upon factors such as the quoted market price of similar assets or a discounted cash flow model using readily observable market data, which may include interest rate curves and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities, depending on the nature of the investment. The fair value of our long-term debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates offered to us for debt of the same remaining maturities. Level 3: We determine the fair value of our auction rate securities using an internally-developed valuation model, using inputs that include interest rate curves, credit and liquidity spreads and effective maturity. Assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis may include items such as property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, equity and other investments and other assets. We determine the fair value of these items using Level 3 inputs, as described in the related sections below. Derivative Instruments We manage our exposure to various risks within our consolidated financial statements according to a market price risk management policy. Under this policy, we may engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments to hedge interest rates, commodity prices and foreign currency-denominated revenue streams, inventory purchases, assets and liabilities and investments in certain foreign operations. In order to manage our exposure to these risks, we use various types of derivative instruments including forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, collars and swaps. Forward contracts and commodity futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a predetermined future date and at a predetermined rate or price. A collar is a strategy that uses a combination of a purchased call option and a sold put option with equal premiums to hedge a portion of anticipated cash flows, or to limit possible gains or losses on an underlying asset or liability to a specific range. A swap agreement is a contract between two parties to exchange cash flows based on specified underlying notional amounts, assets and/or indices. We do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes. We record all derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value and typically do not offset derivative assets and liabilities. Excluding interest rate hedging instruments, cross-currency swaps and foreign currency debt hedging instruments, we generally do not enter into derivative instruments with maturities longer than three years. However, we are allowed to net settle transactions with respective counterparties for certain derivative contracts, inclusive of interest rate swaps and foreign currency forwards, with a single, net amount payable by one party to the other. We also enter into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. As of October 3, 2021 and September 27, 2020, cash collateral held under collateral security arrangements was $ 44.7 million and $ 34.9 million, respectively, and is included in other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. The potential effects of netting arrangements with our derivative contracts, excluding the effects of collateral, would not have had a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets. By using these derivative instruments, we expose ourselves to potential credit risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. We minimize this credit risk by entering into transactions with carefully selected, credit-worthy counterparties and distribute contracts among several financial institutions to reduce the concentration of credit risk. Cash Flow Hedges For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the derivative's gain or loss is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) on our consolidated balance sheets. The gain or loss is subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged exposure affects net earnings, in the same line item as the underlying hedged item on our consolidated statements of earnings. Cash flow hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the inception of each hedge. Cash flows from hedging transactions are classified in the same categories as the cash flows from the respective hedged items. For de-designated cash flow hedges in which the transactions are no longer likely to occur, the related accumulated derivative gains or losses are recognized in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings based on the nature of the underlying transaction. Net Investment Hedges For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a net investment hedge, the derivative's, or qualifying non-derivative instrument’s gain or loss is reported as a component of OCI and recorded in AOCI. The gain or loss will be subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. 49 Table of Contents Fair Value Hedges For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the changes in fair value of the derivative instrument and the offsetting changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item due to changes in the hedged risk are recorded in interest income and other, net or interest expense on our consolidated statements of earnings. Derivatives Not Designated As Hedging Instruments We also enter into certain foreign currency forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, collars and swaps that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. The changes in the fair values of these contracts are immediately recognized in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. Normal Purchase Normal Sale We enter into fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed green coffee purchase commitments, which are described further in Note 5 , Inventories. For both fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed purchase commitments, we expect to take delivery of green coffee and to utilize the coffee in a reasonable period of time in the ordinary course of business. Since these types of purchase commitments qualify for the normal purchase normal sale exemption, they are not recorded as derivative instruments on our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 3 , Derivative Financial Instruments, and Note 5 , Inventories, for further discussion of our derivative instruments and green coffee purchase commitments. Receivables, net of Allowance for Credit Losses Our receivables are mainly comprised of receivables for product and equipment sales to and royalties from our licensees, as well as receivables from our Global Coffee Alliance and other Channel Development customers. The primary indicators of the credit quality of our receivables are aging, payment history, economic sector information and outside credit monitoring, and are assessed on a quarterly basis. Our credit loss exposure is mainly concentrated in our accounts receivable portfolio. Our allowance for credit losses is calculated using a loss-rate method based on historical experience, current market conditions and reasonable forecasts. We also assessed incremental risks due to COVID-19 on our licensees’ financial viability. For the year ended October 3, 2021, we did not observe a significant deterioration of our receivable portfolio that required a significant increase in our allowance for credit losses. As of October 3, 2021, our allowance for credit losses was $ 25.6 million. As of September 27, 2020, prior to adoption of the new estimated credit losses methodology, our allowance for doubtful accounts was $ 27.1 million. To assist certain international licensed partners with their business recovery from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we provided payment extensions for their outstanding receivables to help them dedicate their capital to further develop stores and build the brand. During the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we also temporarily waived royalty payments from our international licensees and did not recognize royalty revenues associated with these accounts. Normal royalty billings and collections resumed during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020. We do not believe the terms and forms of these financial relief actions changed our revenue recognition policy or had a significant impact on future collectability. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (primarily moving average cost) or net realizable value. We record inventory reserves for obsolete and slow-moving inventory and for estimated shrinkage between physical inventory counts. Inventory reserves are based on inventory obsolescence trends, historical experience and application of the specific identification method. As of October 3, 2021 and September 27, 2020, inventory reserves were $ 36.6 million and $ 48.4 million , respectively. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes all direct costs necessary to acquire and prepare assets for use, including internal labor and overhead in some cases. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of the assets, generally ranging from 2 to 15 years for equipment and 30 to 40 years for buildings. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the related lease life, generally 10 years. For leases with renewal periods at our option, we generally use the original lease term, excluding renewal option periods, to determine estimated useful lives. If failure to exercise a renewal option imposes an economic penalty to us, we may determine at the inception of the lease that renewal is reasonably assured and include the renewal option period in the determination of the appropriate estimated useful lives. The portion of depreciation expense related to production and distribution facilities is included in product and distribution costs on our consolidated statements of earnings. The costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed when incurred, while expenditures for refurbishments and improvements that significantly add to the productive capacity or extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized. When assets are disposed of, whether through retirement or sale, the net gain or loss is recognized in 50 Table of Contents net earnings. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell. We evaluate property, plant and equipment for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. When evaluating for impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The fair value of the asset is estimated using a discounted cash flow model based on forecasted future revenues and operating costs, using internal projections. Property, plant and equipment assets and ROU assets related to the store lease are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For company-operated store assets, the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level. We recognized net disposition and impairment charges of $ 153.1 million, $ 294.9 million and $ 108.0 million in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Of the total net impairment and disposition charges, $ 53.1 million, $ 151.0 million and $ 7.3 million in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were restructuring related and recorded in restructuring and impairment expenses. For fiscal 2021 and 2020, we evaluated COVID-19 business recovery trends and their estimated impacts on future revenue growth and profitability for assessing impairment of our company-operated retail store and related operating lease ROU assets. As a result, we recorded $ 44.4 million and $ 59.6 million of impairment losses within store operating expenses on our consolidated statements of earnings during the years ended October 3, 2021 and September 27, 2020, respectively. Unless it is restructuring related, the nature of the underlying asset that is impaired or disposed of will determine the operating expense line on which the related impact is recorded on our consolidated statements of earnings. Leases The majority of our leases are operating leases for our company-operated retail store locations. We also lease, among other things, roasting, distribution and warehouse facilities and office space for corporate administrative purposes. We categorize leases as either operating or finance leases at the commencement date of the lease. Operating lease agreements may contain tenant improvement allowances, rent holidays, rent escalation clauses and/or contingent rent provisions. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for together as a single lease component for all underlying classes of assets. We recognize a ROU asset and lease liability for each operating and finance lease with a contractual term greater than 12 months at the time of lease inception. We do not record leases with an initial term of 12 months or less on our consolidated balance sheet but continue to record rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Our leases often include options to extend or terminate at our sole discretion, which are included in the determination of lease term when they are reasonably certain to be exercised. Our lease liability represents the present value of future lease payments over the lease term. Given our policy election to combine lease and non-lease components, we also consider fixed common area maintenance (“CAM”) part of our fixed future lease payments; therefore, fixed CAM is also included in our lease liability. We cannot determine the interest rate implicit in each of our leases. Therefore, we use market and term-specific incremental borrowing rates. Our incremental borrowing rate for a lease is the rate of interest we expect to pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments under similar terms. Because we do not borrow on a collateralized basis, we consider a combination of factors, including our credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate, the risk profile and funding cost of the specific geographic market of the lease, the lease term and the effect of adjusting the rate to reflect consideration of collateral. Our credit-adjusted risk-free rate takes into consideration interest rates we pay on our unsecured long-term bonds as well as quoted interest rates obtained from financial institutions. Total lease costs recorded as rent and other occupancy costs include fixed operating lease costs, variable lease costs and short-term lease costs. Most of our real estate leases require we pay certain expenses, such as CAM costs, real estate taxes and other executory costs, of which the fixed portion is included in operating lease costs. We recognize operating lease costs on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In addition to the above costs, variable lease costs also include amounts based on a percentage of gross sales in excess of specified levels and are recognized when probable and are not included in determining the present value of our lease liability. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. A significant majority of our leases are related to our company-operated stores, and their related costs are recorded within store operating expenses. The ROU asset is measured at the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, initial direct costs and any tenant improvement allowances received. For operating leases, ROU assets are reduced over the lease term by the recognized straight-line lease expense less the amount of accretion of the lease liability determined using the effective interest method. For finance leases, ROU assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the 51 Table of Contents shorter of the useful life of the leased asset or the lease term. Interest expense on each finance lease liability is recognized utilizing the effective interest method. ROU assets are tested for impairment in the same manner as long-lived assets. Additionally, we monitor for events or changes in circumstances that may require a reassessment of one of our leases and determine if a remeasurement is required. During fiscal 2021, the COVID-19-related rent concessions we received for stores, primarily in our International segment, were immaterial. During fiscal 2020, we received $ 27.6 million of COVID-19-related rent concessions for stores in our International segment generally correlating with the temporary period our stores were closed. Consistent with updated guidance from the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) in April 2020, we elected to treat COVID-19-related rent concessions as variable rent. Rent concessions were recognized as an offset to our rent expense within store operating expenses on our consolidated statement of earnings. See Note 10 , Leases, for additional details. Additionally, for the years ended October 3, 2021 and September 27, 2020, we recognized accelerated amortization of ROU lease assets and other lease costs of $ 89.5 million and $ 87.7 million, respectively, due to planned store closures prior to the end of contractual lease terms, which were recorded in restructuring and impairments on the consolidated statement of earnings. Goodwill We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change, such as material deterioration in performance or a significant number of store closures, that would indicate that impairment may exist. When evaluating goodwill for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. Fair value is typically calculated using a discounted cash flow model. For certain reporting units, where deemed appropriate, we may also utilize a market approach for estimating fair value. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value. As part of our ongoing operations, we may close certain stores within a reporting unit containing goodwill due to underperformance of the store or inability to renew our lease, among other reasons. We may abandon certain assets associated with a closed store, including leasehold improvements and other non-transferable assets. When a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business is to be disposed of, goodwill associated with the business is included in the carrying amount of the business in determining any loss on disposal. Our evaluation of whether the portion of a reporting unit being disposed of constitutes a business occurs on the date of abandonment. Although an operating store meets the accounting definition of a business prior to abandonment, it does not constitute a business on the closure date because the remaining assets on that date do not constitute an integrated set of activities (substantive processes) and assets that are capable of being managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. As a result, when closing individual stores, we do not include goodwill in the calculation of any loss on disposal of the related assets. We recorded no goodwill impairment during fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2019, we recorded goodwill impairment of $ 10.5 million. See Note 8 , Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill, for further information. Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets include finite-lived intangible assets, which mainly consist of acquired and reacquired rights, trade secrets, licensing agreements, contract-based patents and copyrights. These assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment using a similar methodology to our property, plant and equipment, as described above. Indefinite-lived intangibles, which consist primarily of trade names and trademarks, are tested for impairment annually during the third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that impairment may exist. When evaluating other intangible assets for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an intangible asset group is impaired. If we do not perform the qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset group exceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset group. Fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the intangible asset group and is typically calculated using an income approach, such as a relief-from-royalty model. If the carrying amount of the intangible asset group exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value. In addition, we continuously monitor and may revise our intangible asset useful lives if and when facts and circumstances change. There were no significant other intangible asset impairment charges recorded during fiscal 2021. We recorded other intangible asset impairment charges of $ 22.1 million during fiscal 2020. There were no significant other intangible asset impairments charges recorded during fiscal 2019. See Note 8 , Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill, for further information. 52 Table of Contents Insurance Reserves We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance treaty, to provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks, including workers’ compensation, healthcare benefits, general liability, property insurance and director and officers’ liability insurance. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by us are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographics, exposure and severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Revenue Recognition Consolidated revenues are presented net of intercompany eliminations for wholly-owned subsidiaries and investees controlled by us and for product sales to and royalty and other fees from licensees accounted for under the equity method. Additionally, consolidated revenues are recognized net of any discounts, returns, allowances and sales incentives, including coupon redemptions and rebates. Company-operated Store Revenues Company-operated store revenues are recognized when payment is tendered at the point of sale as the performance obligation has been satisfied. Company-operated store revenues are reported excluding sales, use or other transaction taxes that are collected from customers and remitted to taxing authorities. Licensed Store Revenues Licensed store revenues consist of product and equipment sales, royalties and other fees paid by licensees using the Starbucks brand. Sales of coffee, tea, food and related products are generally recognized upon shipment to licensees, depending on contract terms. Shipping charges billed to licensees are also recognized as revenue, and the related shipping costs are included in product and distribution costs on our consolidated statements of earnings. We consider pre-opening services, including site evaluation and selection, store architectural/design and development and operational training, to be performance obligations that are separate from the license to operate under the Starbucks brand. These services provide distinct value to our licensees, including business and industry insight and knowledge that transfers value apart from the license. Revenues associated with pre-opening services are recognized upon completion of the related performance obligations, generally when a store is opened. Royalty revenues are recognized based upon a percentage of reported sales, and other continuing fees, such as marketing and service fees, are recognized as the performance obligations are met. Stored Value Cards Stored value cards can be activated through various channels, including at our company-operated and most licensed store locations, online at Starbucks.com or via mobile devices held by our customers and at certain other third-party websites and locations, such as grocery stores, although they cannot be reloaded at these third-party websites or locations. Amounts loaded onto stored value cards are initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue upon redemption. Historically, the majority of stored value cards are redeemed within one year. In many of our company-owned markets, including the U.S., our stored value cards do not have an expiration date nor do we charge service fees that cause a decrement to customer balances. Based on historical redemption rates, a portion of stored value cards is not expected to be redeemed and will be recognized as breakage over time in proportion to stored value card redemptions. The redemption rates are based on historical redemption patterns for each market, including the timing and business channel in which the card was activated or reloaded, and remittance to government agencies under unclaimed property laws, if applicable. Breakage is recognized as company-operated stores and licensed stores revenue within the consolidated statement of earnings. For the fiscal years ended October 3, 2021, September 27, 2020 and September 29, 2019, we recognized breakage revenue of $ 164.5 million, $ 130.3 million and $ 125.1 million in company-operated store revenues, respectively, and $ 16.6 million, $ 14.3 million and $ 15.7 million in licensed store revenues, respectively. 53 Table of Contents Loyalty Program Customers in the U.S., Canada and certain other countries who register their Starbucks Card are automatically enrolled in the Starbucks ® Rewards program, which is primarily a spend-based loyalty program. They earn loyalty points (“Stars”) in a variety of ways, including with each purchase at participating Starbucks ® stores and when making purchases with the Starbucks-branded credit and debit cards. Starbucks ® Rewards members can earn Stars by paying with cash, credit or debit cards, or selected mobile wallets at company-operated stores in the U.S. and Canada. After accumulating a certain number of Stars, the customer earns a reward that can be redeemed for free product that, regardless of where the related Stars were earned within that country, will be honored at company-operated stores and certain participating licensed store locations in that same country. We defer revenue associated with the estimated selling price of Stars earned by Starbucks ® Rewards members towards free product as each Star is earned and a corresponding liability is established in deferred revenue. This deferral is based on the estimated value of the product for which the reward is expected to be redeemed, net of estimated unredeemed Stars. Stars generally expire after six months. When a customer redeems an earned reward, we recognize revenue for the redeemed product and reduce the related deferred revenue. Other Revenues Other revenues primarily include royalty revenues, sales of packaged coffee, tea and a variety of ready-to-drink beverages and single-serve coffee and tea products to customers outside of our company-operated and licensed stores. Sales of these products are generally recognized upon shipment to customers, depending on contract terms. Other revenues also include product sales to and licensing revenue from Nestlé related to our Global Coffee Alliance. Product sales to Nestlé are generally recognized when the product is shipped whereas royalty revenues are recognized based on a percentage of reported sales. Deferred Revenues Our deferred revenue primarily consists of the up-front prepaid royalty from Nestlé, for which we have continuing performance obligations to support the Global Coffee Alliance, and our unredeemed stored value card liability and unredeemed Stars associated with our loyalty program. See Note 11 , Deferred Revenue, for further information. Disaggregation of Revenues Revenues disaggregated by segment, product type and geographic area are disclosed in Note 17 , Segment Reporting. Product and Distribution Costs Product and distribution costs primarily consist of raw materials, purchased goods and packaging costs as well as operational costs of our supply chain organization, such as wages and benefits, occupancy costs and depreciation expenses, in support of sourcing, procuring, manufacturing, warehousing and transportation activities of products sold at our company-operated and licensed stores as well as through Channel Development and our other businesses. Also included are inventory and supply chain asset impairment costs. Store Operating Expenses Store operating expenses consist of costs incurred in our company-operated stores, primarily wages and benefits related to store partners (employees), occupancy costs and other costs that directly support the operation and sales-related activities of those stores. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses primarily consist of wages and benefits, professional service fees and occupancy costs for corporate headquarter and regional offices that support our corporate functions, including technology, finance, legal and partner resources . Advertising We expense most advertising costs as they are incurred, except for certain production costs that are expensed the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expenses totaled $ 305.1 million, $ 258.8 million and $ 245.7 million in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 54 Table of Contents Government Subsidies On March 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”), which among other things, provides employer payroll tax credits for wages paid to employees who are unable to work during the COVID-19 pandemic and options to defer payroll tax payments for a limited period. Based on our evaluation of the CARES Act, we qualify for certain employer payroll tax credits as well as the deferral of payroll tax payments in the future. Additionally, the Canadian government enacted the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (“CEWS”) to help employers offset a portion of their employee wages for a limited period. We elected to treat qualified government subsidies from the U.S., Canada and other governments as offsets to the related operating expenses. The qualified payroll credits reduced our store operating expenses by $ 210.0 million and $ 349.6 million on our consolidated statement of earnings during fiscal 2021 and 2020, respectively. After netting the qualified credits against our payable, a receivable balance of $ 172.4 million and $ 155.1 million was included in prepaid expenses and other current assets as of October 3, 2021 and September 27, 2020, respectively. During the year ended October 3, 2021, we deferred $ 81.7 million of qualified payroll tax payments. As of October 3, 2021, deferred payroll tax payments of $ 116.4 million were included in both accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets. As of September 27, 2020, deferred payroll tax payments of $ 151.0 million were included in other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Store Preopening Expenses Costs incurred in connection with the start-up and promotion of new company-operated store openings are expensed as incurred. Asset Retirement Obligations We recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations (“ARO”) when such obligations are incurred. Our AROs are primarily associated with leasehold improvements, which, at the end of a lease, we are contractually obligated to remove in order to comply with the lease agreement. At the inception of a lease with such conditions, we record an ARO liability and a corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation. We estimate the liability using a number of assumptions, including store closing costs, cost inflation rates and discount rates, and accrete the liability to its projected future value over time. The capitalized asset is depreciated using the same depreciation convention as leasehold improvement assets. Upon satisfaction of the ARO conditions, any difference between the recorded ARO liability and the actual retirement costs incurred is recognized as a gain or loss in store operating expense on our consolidated statements of earnings. As of October 3, 2021 and September 27, 2020, our net ARO assets included in property, plant and equipment were $ 30.9 million and $ 30.7 million, respectively, and our net ARO liabilities included in other long-term liabilities were $ 116.5 million and $ 111.0 million, respectively. Stock-based Compensation We maintain several equity incentive plans under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) or stock appreciation rights to employees, non-employee directors and consultants. We also have an employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”). RSUs issued by us are equivalent to nonvested shares under the applicable accounting guidance. We record stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of stock awards at the grant date and recognize the expense over the related service period following a graded vesting expense schedule. Expense for performance-based RSUs is recognized when it is probable the performance goal will be achieved. Performance goals are determined by the Board of Directors and may include measures such as earnings per share, operating income and return on invested capital. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model. The assumptions used to calculate the fair value of options granted are evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect market conditions and our historical experience. The fair value of RSUs is based on the closing price of Starbucks common stock on the award date, less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. If applicable, our total shareholder return relative to our peer group is incorporated into the underlying assumptions using a Monte Carlo simulation valuation model to calculate grant date fair value. Compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award, and only for those awards expected to vest, with forfeitures estimated at the date of grant based on our historical experience and future expectations. Foreign Currency Translation Our international operations generally use their local currency as their functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Income and expense accounts are translated at the average monthly exchange rates during the year. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of OCI and recorded in AOCI on our consolidated balance sheets. 55 Table of Contents Income Taxes We compute income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred income taxes are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred taxes is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdictions from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and results of recent operations. If we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes. In addition, our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include review of our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions. We evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of our position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. For uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold, we record a related liability. We adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available. Starbucks recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense on our consolidated statements of earnings. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax balances on our consolidated balance sheets. Global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) provisions are applied, providing an incremental tax on foreign income. We have made a policy election to classify taxes due under the GILTI provision as a current period expense. Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock and the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period, calculated using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and RSUs. Performance-based RSUs are considered dilutive when the related performance criterion has been met. Common Stock Share Repurchases We may repurchase shares of Starbucks common stock under a program authorized by our Board of Directors, including pursuant to a contract, instruction or written plan meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the Exchange Act. Under applicable Washington State law, shares repurchased are retired and not displayed separately as treasury stock on the financial statements. Instead, the par value of repurchased shares is deducted from common stock and the excess repurchase price over par value is deducted from additional paid-in capital and from retained earnings (deficit). Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance replacing the incurred loss impairment methodology with a new methodology that reflects current expected credit losses on financial assets, including receivables and available-for-sale securities. The new methodology requires entities to estimate and recognize expected credit losses each reporting period. The guidance was adopted during the first quarter of fiscal 2021 under the modified retrospective approach and resulted in a $ 2.2 million transition adjustment to opening shareholders’ retained deficit on our consolidated statements of equity. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In March 2020, the FASB issued guidance related to reference rate reform. The pronouncement provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the current guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burden related to the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. The guidance was effective upon issuance and generally can be applied to applicable contract modifications through December 31, 2022. We expect to adopt the guidance and begin transitioning from 56 Table of Contents LIBOR to alternative reference rates in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. We do not expect adoption and transition to alternative reference rates to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Note 2: Acquisitions, Divestitures and Strategic Alliance Fiscal 2021 In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we sold our 50 % ownership interest in Starbucks Coffee Korea Co., Ltd. where our joint venture partner, E-Mart Inc., acquired an additional 17.5 % interest and Apfin Investment Pte Ltd, an affiliate of GIC Private Limited, which is a Singapore sovereign wealth fund, acquired the remaining 32.5 %. The sale had a combined price of $ 1.175 billion. This transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $ 864.5 million, which is included in net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations on our consolidated statements of earnings. Fiscal 2019 In the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we sold our company-operated retail business in Thailand to Coffee Concepts Thailand, a joint-venture between Maxim's Caterers Limited and F&N Retail Connection Co. Ltd, converting this operation to a fully licensed market. This transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $ 601.9 million, which was included in net gains resulting from divestiture of certain operations on our consolidated statements of earnings. In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we sold our company-operated retail businesses in France and the Netherlands to Alsea, S.A.B. de C.V. converting these operations to fully licensed markets. These transactions did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Note 3: Derivative Financial Instruments Interest Rates From time to time, we enter into designated cash flow hedges to manage the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates. We enter into interest rate swap agreements and treasury locks, which are synthetic forward sales of U.S. treasury securities settled in cash based upon the difference between an agreed-upon treasury rate and the prevailing treasury rate at settlement. These agreements are cash settled at the time of the pricing of the related debt. Each derivative agreement's gain or loss is recorded in AOCI and is subsequently reclassified to interest expense over the life of the related debt. To hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap agreements, which are designated as fair value hedges. The changes in fair values of these derivative instruments and the offsetting changes in fair values of the underlying hedged debt due to changes in the relevant benchmark interest rates are recorded in interest expense. Refer to Note 9 , Debt, for additional information on our long-term debt. Foreign Currency To reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations, we enter into forward and swap contracts to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated intercompany royalty payments, inventory purchases and intercompany borrowing and lending activities. The resulting gains and losses from these derivatives are recorded in AOCI and subsequently reclassified to revenue, product and distribution costs, or interest income and other, net, respectively, when the hedged exposures affect net earnings. From time to time, we may enter into financial instruments, including, but not limited to, forward and swap contracts or foreign currency-denominated debt, to hedge the currency exposure of our net investments in certain international operations. The resulting gains and losses from these derivatives are recorded in AOCI and are subsequently reclassified to net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. Foreign currency forward and swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments are used to mitigate the foreign exchange risk of certain other balance sheet items. Gains and losses from these derivatives are largely offset by the financial impact of translating foreign currency-denominated payables and receivables; these gains and losses are recorded in interest income and other, net. Commodities Depending on market conditions, we may enter into coffee forward contracts, futures contracts and collars to hedge anticipated cash flows under our price-to-be-fixed green coffee contracts, which are described further in Note 5 , Inventories, or our longer-dated forecasted coffee demand where underlying fixed price and price-to-be-fixed contracts are not yet available. The resulting gains and losses are recorded in AOCI and are subsequently reclassified to product and distribution costs when the hedged exposure affects net earnings. Depending on market conditions, we may also enter into dairy forward contracts and futures contracts to hedge a portion of anticipated cash flows under our dairy purchase contracts and our forecasted dairy demand. The resulting gains or losses are 57 Table of Contents recorded in AOCI and are subsequently reclassified to product and distribution costs when the hedged exposure affects net earnings. Cash flow hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the inception of each hedge. Cash flows from hedging transactions are classified in the same categories as the cash flows from the respective hedged items. For de-designated cash flow hedges in which the underlying transactions are no longer probable of occurring, the related accumulated derivative gains or losses are recognized in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. There were no significant cash flow hedge de-designations in fiscal 2021. During the second and third quarters of fiscal 2020, we de-designated certain cash flow hedges due to the global COVID-19 impacts, which resulted in the release of an insignificant net gain from AOCI to our consolidated statement of earnings. To mitigate the price uncertainty of a portion of our future purchases, including diesel fuel and other commodities, we enter into swap contracts, futures and collars that are not designated as hedging instruments. The resulting gains and losses are recorded in interest income and other, net to help offset price fluctuations on our beverage, food, packaging and transportation costs, which are included in product and distribution costs on our consolidated statements of earnings.

Available-for-sale Debt Securities Long-term in vestments generally mature within 4 years. Proceeds from sales of securities were $ 134.1 million, $ 177.4 million and $ 291.1 million for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Realized gains and losses were not material for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019. Gross unrealized holding gains and losses were not material as of October 3, 2021 and September 27, 2020. 62 Table of Contents Marketable Equity Securities Marketable equity securities include equity mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. Our marketable equity securities portfolio approximates a portion of our liability under our MDCP, a defined contribution plan. Our MDCP liability was $ 105.2 million and $ 91.4 million as of October 3, 2021 and September 27, 2020, respectively. The changes in net unrealized holding gains and losses in the marketable equity securities portfolio included in earnings for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019 were not material. Gross unrealized holding gains and losses on marketable equity securities were not material as of October 3, 2021 and September 27, 2020. Derivative Assets and Liabilities Derivative assets and liabilities include foreign currency forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, collars and swaps, which are described further in Note 3 , Derivative Financial Instruments. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include items such as property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, equity and other investments and other assets. These assets are measured at fair value if determined to be impaired. Impairment of property, plant and equipment and ROU assets is included in Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. We have recognized impairments during fiscal 2021 and 2020 primarily related to our North America restructuring plan. See Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, Note 10 , Leases and Note 8 , Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill for additional discussion of these impairments. Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments The estimated fair value of our long-term debt based on the quoted market price (Level 2) is included at Note 9 , Debt. Note 5: Inventories (in millions) Oct 3, 2021 Sep 27, 2020 Coffee: Unroasted $ 670.3 $ 664.7 Roasted 233.5 223.5 Other merchandise held for sale 329.3 293.9 Packaging and other supplies 370.8 369.3 Total $ 1,603.9 $ 1,551.4 Other merchandise held for sale includes, among other items, serveware, food and tea. Inventory levels vary due to seasonality, commodity market supply and price fluctuations. As of October 3, 2021, we had committed to purchasing green coffee totaling $ 599 million under fixed-price contracts and an estimated $ 1,126 million under price-to-be-fixed contracts. A portion of our price-to-be-fixed contacts are effectively fixed through the use of futures. See Note 3 , Derivative Financial Instruments for further discussion. Price-to-be-fixed contracts are purchase commitments whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore the price, at which the base “C” coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established. For most contracts, either Starbucks or the seller has the option to “fix” the base “C” coffee commodity price prior to the delivery date. For other contracts, Starbucks and the seller may agree upon pricing parameters determined by the base “C” coffee commodity price. Until prices are fixed, we estimate the total cost of these purchase commitments. We believe, based on relationships established with our suppliers in the past and continuous monitoring of the business environment, the risk of non-delivery on these purchase commitments is remote. During fiscal 2020, we wrote off approximately $ 50 million of inventory that was expiring or expected to expire due to COVID-19 related store closures, primarily perishable food and beverage ingredients located at our stores, distribution centers and suppliers. This was included in product and distribution costs on our consolidated statement of earnings. We did not record significant write-offs related to COVID-19 during the fiscal year ended October 3, 2021. 63 Table of Contents Note 6: Equity Investments (in millions) Oct 3, 2021 Sep 27, 2020 Equity method investments $ 216.0 $ 426.4 Other investments 52.5 52.3 Total $ 268.5 $ 478.7 Equity Method Investments As of October 3, 2021, we had a 50 % ownership interest in Tata Starbucks Limited (India), which operates licensed Starbucks ® retail stores. Prior to its divestiture in September 2021, we had a 50 % ownership interest in Starbucks Coffee Korea Co., Ltd. Additional disclosure regarding changes in our equity method investments due to acquisition or divestiture is included in Note 2 , Acquisitions, Divestitures and Strategic Alliance. We also license the rights to produce and distribute Starbucks-branded products to our 50 % owned joint venture, The North American Coffee Partnership with the Pepsi-Cola Company, which develops and distributes bottled Starbucks ® beverages, including Frappuccino ® coffee drinks, Starbucks Doubleshot ® espresso drinks, Starbucks ® Iced Espresso Classics and Starbucks ® Iced Coffee. Our share of income and losses from our equity method investments is included in income from equity investees on our consolidated statements of earnings. Also included in this line item is our proportionate share of gross profit resulting from coffee and other product sales to, and royalty and license fee revenues generated from, equity investees. Revenues generated from these entities were $ 160.8 million, $ 123.9 million and $ 130.7 million in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Related product and distribution costs were $ 92.1 million, $ 79.8 million and $ 73.2 million in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of October 3, 2021 and September 27, 2020, there were $ 7.9 million and $ 28.7 million of accounts receivable from equity investees, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets, primarily related to product sales and royalty revenues. Additionally, we hold equity interests in other entities to support our corporate and investment strategies. The related financial statements activities were not material during the periods presented. Other Investments We have equity interests in entities that develop and operate Starbucks licensed stores in several global markets, as well as in companies that support our strategic initiatives. We do not have significant influence over these entities and their fair values are not readily determinable. Therefore, we elected to measure these investments at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairment. 64 Table of Contents Note 7: Supplemental Balance Sheet and Statement of Earnings Information (in millions) Prepaid Expenses and Other Current Assets Oct 3, 2021 Sep 27, 2020 Income tax receivable $ 20.7 $ 356.9 Government subsidies receivable 172.4 155.1 Other prepaid expenses and current assets 401.5 227.5 Total prepaid expenses and current assets $ 594.6 $ 739.5 Property, Plant and Equipment, net Oct 3, 2021 Sep 27, 2020 Land $ 46.2 $ 46.0 Buildings 587.6 586.8 Leasehold improvements 8,637.6 8,262.6 Store equipment 2,934.1 2,800.3 Roasting equipment 857.2 796.6 Furniture, fixtures and other 1,392.0 1,285.7 Work in progress 374.1 377.3 Property, plant and equipment, gross 14,828.8 14,155.3 Accumulated depreciation ( 8,459.3 ) ( 7,913.9 ) Property, plant and equipment, net $ 6,369.5 $ 6,241.4 Accrued Liabilities Oct 3, 2021 Sep 27, 2020 Accrued occupancy costs $ 107.1 $ 76.9 Accrued dividends payable 578.1 — Accrued capital and other operating expenditures 840.7 677.2 Self-insurance reserves 229.3 243.9 Accrued business taxes 218.0 162.7 Total accrued liabilities $ 1,973.2 $ 1,160.7 Store Operating Expenses Year Ended Oct 3, 2021 Sep 27, 2020 Sep 29, 2019 Wages and benefits $ 6,989.3 $ 6,131.9 $ 5,941.7 Occupancy costs 2,561.5 2,388.0 2,411.2 Other expenses 2,380.1 2,244.1 2,140.7 Total store operating expenses $ 11,930.9 $ 10,764.0 $ 10,493.6 65 Table of Contents Note 8: Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets (in millions) Oct 3, 2021 Sep 27, 2020 Trade names, trademarks and patents $ 96.4 $ 95.0 Finite-Lived Intangible Assets Oct 3, 2021 Sep 27, 2020 (in millions) Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Amount Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Net Carrying Amount Acquired and reacquired rights $ 1,141.5 $ ( 971.9 ) $ 169.6 $ 1,116.1 $ ( 765.0 ) $ 351.1 Acquired trade secrets and processes 27.6 ( 24.8 ) 2.8 27.6 ( 22.0 ) 5.6 Trade names, trademarks and patents 126.3 ( 51.9 ) 74.4 124.8 ( 32.1 ) 92.7 Licensing agreements 18.8 ( 13.5 ) 5.3 16.6 ( 15.0 ) 1.6 Other finite-lived intangible assets 24.0 ( 22.6 ) 1.4 22.8 ( 16.7 ) 6.1 Total finite-lived intangible assets $ 1,338.2 $ ( 1,084.7 ) $ 253.5 $ 1,307.9 $ ( 850.8 ) $ 457.1 Amortization expense for finite-lived intangible assets was $ 223.4 million, $ 223.7 million and $ 232.8 million during fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. During the fiscal year ended September 27, 2020, we recorded a charge of $ 22.1 million to restructuring and impairments on our consolidated statement of earnings as the analysis indicated the carrying value of one of the assets exceeded its fair value. Our fiscal 2021 analysis indicated excess fair values over carrying values for these assets, and therefore no impairment charge was recorded.

The results of our analysis indicated significant excess fair values over carrying values across the different reporting units, and therefore no goodwill impairment was recorded. 66 Table of Contents Note 9: Debt Revolving Credit Facility During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we replaced our $ 2.0 billion unsecured 5-year revolving credit facility (the ""2018 credit facility"") and our $ 1.0 billion unsecured 364-Day credit facility (the ""364-day credit facility"") with a new $ 3.0 billion unsecured 5-year revolving credit facility (the ""2021 credit facility""). The 2021 credit facility is available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases. The 2021 credit facility, of which $ 150 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit, is currently set to mature on September 16, 2026 . We have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $ 1.0 billion. Borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR, and, for U.S. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on the Company’s long-term credit ratings assigned by Moody’s and Standard & Poor’s rating agencies. The 2021 credit facility contains alternative interest rate provisions specifying rate calculations to be used at such time LIBOR ceases to be available as a benchmark due to reference rate reform. The “Base Rate” of interest is the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.025 %, (ii) Bank of America’s prime rate, and (iii) the Eurocurrency Rate (as defined in the credit facility) plus 1.025 %. The 2021 credit facility contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which measures our ability to cover financing expenses. As of October 3, 2021, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. No amounts were outstanding under our 2021 credit facility as of October 3, 2021.

The up-front payment of approximately $ 7 billion was recorded as deferred revenue as we have continuing performance obligations to support the Global Coffee Alliance, including providing Nestlé access to certain intellectual properties and products for future resale. The up-front payment is being recognized as other revenue on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life of the arrangement of 40 years for the ongoing access to the licenses within the contractual territories. Our obligations to maintain the Starbucks brand and other intellectual properties are generally constant throughout the term of the arrangement. Therefore, a ratable recognition pattern is reflective of how we will satisfy our performance obligations.

We repurchased 20.3 million shares of common stock for $ 1.7 billion on the open market during the year ended September 27, 2020. As of September 27, 2020, 48.9 million shares remained available for repurchase under current authorizations.

Note 13: Employee Stock and Benefit Plans We maintain several equity incentive plans under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) or stock appreciation rights to employees, non-employee directors and consultants. We issue new shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options and the vesting of RSUs. We also have an employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”). As of October 3, 2021, there were 41.0 million shares of common stock available for issuance pursuant to future equity-based compensation awards and 11.3 million shares available for issuance under our ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements (in millions) : Fiscal Year Ended Oct 3, 2021 Sep 27, 2020 Sep 29, 2019 RSUs $ 316.9 $ 241.0 $ 288.0 Options 2.2 7.5 20.0 Total stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings $ 319.1 $ 248.5 $ 308.0 Total related tax benefit $ 51.6 $ 47.8 $ 59.3 Total capitalized stock-based compensation included in net property, plant and equipment on the consolidated balance sheets $ 3.7 $ 3.6 $ 3.4 RSUs We have both time-vested and performance-based RSUs. Time-vested RSUs are awarded to eligible employees and entitle the grantee to receive shares of common stock at the end of a vesting period, subject solely to the employee’s continuing employment. The time-vested RSUs either vest in two or four equal annual installments beginning a year from the grant date. Our performance-based RSUs are awarded to eligible employees and entitle the grantee to receive shares of common stock if we achieve specified performance goals during the performance period and the grantee remains employed through the vesting period. 73 Table of Contents RSU transactions for the year ended October 3, 2021 (in millions, except per share and contractual life amounts) : Number of Shares Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value per Share Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life (Years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value Nonvested, September 27, 2020 8.3 $ 74.23 1.1 $ 699 Granted 4.1 96.05 Vested ( 3.2 ) 69.99 Forfeited/canceled ( 1.5 ) 87.72 Nonvested, October 3, 2021 7.7 86.23 0.9 869 As of October 3, 2021, total unrecogniz ed stock-based compensation expense related to nonvested RSUs, net of estimated forfeitures, was approximately $ 145 million, before income taxes, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.0 years. The total fair value of RSUs vested was $ 226 million, $ 211 million and $ 255 million during fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For fiscal 2020 and 2019, the weighted average fair value per RSU granted was $ 81.96 and $ 68.14 , respectively. Stock Option Plans We may provide stock options as a form of employee compensation, which are primarily time-vested. The majority of time-vested options become exercisable in four equal installments beginning a year from the grant date and generally expire 10 years from the grant date. Options granted to non-employee directors generally vest immediately or one year from grant. All outstanding stock options are non-qualified stock options. The fair value of stock option awards was estimated at the grant date with the following weighted average assumptions for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019: Stock Options Granted During the Period Fiscal Year Ended 2021 2020 2019 Expected term (in years) 8.1 7.8 4.1 Expected stock price volatility 26.3 % 27.3 % 21.6 % Risk-free interest rate 1.4 % 1.2 % 2.9 % Expected dividend yield 1.6 % 2.9 % 2.1 % Weighted average grant price $ 110.46 $ 56.33 $ 67.33 Estimated fair value per option granted $ 27.59 $ 11.30 $ 11.06 The expected term of the options represents the estimated period of time until exercise and is based on historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior. Expected stock price volatility is based on a combination of historical volatility of our stock and the one-year implied volatility of Starbucks traded options, for the related vesting periods. The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term. The dividend yield assumption is based on our anticipated cash dividend payouts. The amounts shown above for the estimated fair value per option granted are before the estimated effect of forfeitures, which reduce the amount of expense recorded in the consolidated statements of earnings. 74 Table of Contents Stock option transactions for the year ended October 3, 2021 (in millions, except per share and contractual life amounts) : Shares Subject to Options Weighted Average Exercise Price per Share Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life (Years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value Outstanding, September 27, 2020 9.2 $ 53.06 5.4 $ 286 Granted 0.0 110.46 Exercised ( 4.0 ) 51.31 Expired/forfeited 0.0 56.69 Outstanding, October 3, 2021 5.2 54.58 4.5 303 Exercisable, October 3, 2021 4.4 53.06 4.1 261 Vested and expected to vest, October 3, 2021 5.2 54.57 4.5 302 The aggregate intrinsic value in the table above, which is the amount by which the market value of the underlying stock exceeded the exercise price of outstanding options, is before applicable income taxes and represents the amount optionees would have realized if all in-the-money options had been exercised on the last business day of the period indicated. As of October 3, 2021, total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to nonvested options was approximately $ 0.1 million, before income taxes, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 0.5 years. The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $ 219 million, $ 236 million and $ 466 million during fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The total fair value of options vested was $ 14 million, $ 25 million and $ 31 million during fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. ESPP Our ESPP allows eligible employees to contribute up to 10 % of their base earnings toward the quarterly purchase of our common stock, subject to an annual maximum dollar amount. The purchase price is 95 % of the fair market value of the stock on the last business day of the quarterly offering period. The number of shares issued under our ESPP was 0.5 million in fiscal 2021. Deferred Compensation Plan We have a Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors under which non-employee directors may, for any fiscal year, irrevocably elect to defer receipt of shares of common stock the director would have received upon vesting of restricted stock units. The number of deferred shares outstanding related to deferrals made under this plan is not material. Defined Contribution Plans We maintain voluntary defined contribution plans, both qualified and non-qualified, covering eligible employees as defined in the plan documents.

Uncertain Tax Positions As of October 3, 2021, we had $ 82.6 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits of which $ 62.8 million, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. We recognized a benefit of $ 4.6 million, an expense of $ 3.0 million and a benefit of $ 2.8 million of interest and penalties in income tax expense, prior to the benefit of the federal tax deduction, for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

The calculation of dilutive shares outstanding would exclude out-of-the-money stock options (i.e., such options’ exercise prices were greater than the average market price of our common shares for the period) because their inclusion would be antidilutive. As of October 3, 2021, September 27, 2020 and September 29, 2019, we had no out-of-the-money stock options. Note 16: Commitments and Contingencies Legal Proceedings On April 13, 2010, an organization named Council for Education and Research on Toxics (“Plaintiff”) filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles, against the Company and certain other defendants who manufacture, package, distribute or sell brewed coffee. The lawsuit is Council for Education and Research on Toxics v. Starbucks Corporation, et al. On May 9, 2011, the Plaintiff filed an additional lawsuit in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles, against the Company and additional defendants who manufacture, package, distribute or sell packaged coffee. The lawsuit is Council for Education and Research on Toxics v. Brad Barry LLC, et al. Both cases have since been consolidated and now include nearly eighty defendants, which constitute the great majority of the coffee industry in California. Plaintiff alleges that the Company and the other defendants failed to provide warnings for their coffee products of exposure to the chemical acrylamide as required under California Health and Safety Code section 25249.5, the California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, better known as Proposition 65. Plaintiff seeks equitable relief, including providing warnings to consumers of coffee products, as well as civil penalties in the amount of the statutory maximum of two thousand five hundred dollars per day per violation of Proposition 65. The Plaintiff asserts that every consumed cup of coffee, absent a compliant warning, is equivalent to a violation under Proposition 65. The Company, as part of a joint defense group organized to defend against the lawsuit, disputes the claims of the Plaintiff. Acrylamide is not added to coffee but is present in all coffee in small amounts (parts per billion) as a byproduct of the coffee bean roasting process. The Company has asserted multiple affirmative defenses. Trial of the first phase of the case commenced on September 8, 2014, and was limited to three affirmative defenses shared by all defendants. On September 1, 2015, the trial court issued a final ruling adverse to defendants on all Phase 1 defenses. Trial of the second phase of the case commenced in the fall of 2017. On May 7, 2018, the trial court issued a ruling adverse to defendants on the Phase 2 defense, the Company's last remaining defense to liability. On June 22, 2018, the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (“OEHHA”) proposed a new regulation clarifying that cancer warnings are not required for coffee under Proposition 65. The case was set to proceed to a third phase trial on damages, remedies and attorneys’ fees on October 15, 2018. However, on October 12, 2018, the California Court of Appeal granted the defendants request for a stay of the Phase 3 trial. On June 3, 2019, the Office of Administrative Law approved the coffee exemption regulation. The regulation became effective on October 1, 2019. On June 24, 2019, the Court of Appeal lifted the stay of the litigation. At the status conference on August 25, 2020, the trial judge granted the defendants’ motion for summary judgment, ruling that the coffee exemption regulation is a complete defense to the Plaintiff’s complaint. The Notice of Entry of Judgment from the court was served on October 6, 2020, and the Plaintiff filed a Notice of Appeal on November 20, 2020, and its opening brief in the appeals process on April 9, 2021. Defendants filed their response brief on August 9, 2021, and Plaintiff filed a reply on November 15, 2021. Starbucks believes that the likelihood that the Company will ultimately incur a material loss in connection with this litigation is less than reasonably possible. Accordingly, no loss contingency was recorded for this matter. 78 Table of Contents Starbucks is party to various other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including certain employment litigation cases that have been certified as class or collective actions, but, except as noted above, is not currently a party to any legal proceeding that management believes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of October 3, 2021 and September 27, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 3, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of October 3, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 19, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit and Compliance Committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Income Taxes — Indefinite Reinvestment of Foreign Earnings - Refer to Note 14 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description Under the provisions of ASC 740, Income Taxes, (“ASC 740”), there is a presumption that investments in foreign subsidiaries will be recovered upon sale or through a partial or complete distribution of earnings to the parent entity, and therefore subject the parent entity to additional taxes. If sufficient evidence shows the foreign subsidiary has invested or will invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely, the ASC 740 presumption may be overcome, and no additional taxes shall be accrued. The Company has investments in the profitable operations of certain foreign subsidiaries that may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and/or U.S. federal and state income taxes upon sale or a partial or complete distribution of earnings, incremental to local income taxes already paid. As of October 3, 2021, the Company is partially indefinitely reinvested in certain foreign subsidiaries. The Company has recorded a deferred tax liability of $83 million related to the taxable temporary difference for which it is not indefinitely reinvested. For the remaining $1.8 billion of taxable temporary difference, there could be up to approximately $290 million of unrecognized tax liability. The Company’s assertion of partial indefinite reinvestment for certain foreign subsidiaries requires management to make long-term forecasting assumptions and detailed plans for reinvestment. The most significant assumption supporting the Company’s indefinite reinvestment assertion is the forecast of capital expenditures in international markets. Performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s indefinite reinvestment analysis and capital expenditures forecast required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our income tax specialists. 81 Table of Contents How the Critical Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our principal audit procedures related to management’s indefinite reinvestment analysis and the supporting forecast of capital expenditures for certain foreign subsidiaries, included the following, among others: • We tested the effectiveness of controls related to management’s forecast of capital expenditures. • We performed a retrospective review of management’s historical ability to accurately forecast capital expenditures by comparing actual results to management’s historical forecast. • We inquired of senior executives of the Company to corroborate strategic plans for growth. • We compared the forecasts obtained to support the indefinite reinvestment assertion to: ◦ Historical capital expenditures, including costs per new store opening; ◦ Historical new store growth; and ◦ Historical profitability of new stores by region; and ◦ Forecasts used by the Company for financial reporting purposes in other areas, such as the evaluation of the recoverability of goodwill; and ◦ Internal communications to management and the Board of Directors; and ◦ Forecasted information included in the Company’s press releases, other external communications and analyst reports; and ◦ External publications of expected industry growth. • With the assistance of our tax specialists, we evaluated the appropriateness of management’s analysis under ASC 740 and the sufficiency of the evidence provided by management to support that the Company has the intent and ability to partially indefinitely reinvest the undistributed earnings. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Seattle, Washington November 19, 2021 We have served as the Company's auditor since 1987. 82 Table of Contents Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure Not applicable. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of the end of the period covered by this report (October 3, 2021). There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect internal control over financial reporting. The certifications required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 are filed as exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 , respectively, to this 10-K. Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework , issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. This evaluation included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of October 3, 2021. Our internal control over financial reporting as of October 3, 2021 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein. 83 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Starbucks Corporation Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Starbucks Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of October 3, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 3, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended October 3, 2021, of the Company and our report dated November 19, 2021, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Seattle, Washington November 19, 2021 84 Table of Contents Item 9B.

Business General Starbucks is the premier roaster, marketer and retailer of specialty coffee in the world, operating in 83 markets. Formed in 1985, Starbucks Corporation’s common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol “SBUX.” We purchase and roast high-quality coffees that we sell, along with handcrafted coffee, tea and other beverages and a variety of high-quality food items through company-operated stores. We also sell a variety of coffee and tea products and license our trademarks through other channels such as licensed stores, as well as grocery and foodservice through our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestlé S. A. (“Nestlé”). In addition to our flagship Starbucks Coffee brand, we sell goods and services under the following brands: Teavana, Seattle’s Best Coffee, Evolution Fresh, Ethos, Starbucks Reserve and Princi. Our objective is to maintain Starbucks standing as one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world. To achieve this, we are continuing the disciplined expansion of our global store base, adding stores in both existing, developed markets such as the U.S. and in newer, higher growth markets such as China, as well as optimizing the mix of company-operated and licensed stores around the world. In addition, by leveraging the experience gained through our traditional store model, we continue to offer consumers new coffee and other products in a variety of forms, across new categories, diverse channels and alternative store formats. We also believe our Starbucks Global Social Impact strategy, commitments related to ethically sourcing high-quality coffee, contributing positively to the communities we do business in and being an employer of choice are contributors to our objective. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“10-K” or “Report”) for the fiscal year ended September 27, 2020 (“fiscal 2020”), Starbucks Corporation (together with its subsidiaries) is referred to as “Starbucks,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our.” Segment Financial Information We have three reportable operating segments: 1) Americas, which is inclusive of the U.S., Canada and Latin America; 2) International, which is inclusive of China, Japan, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East and Africa; and 3) Channel Development. Non-reportable operating segments such as Evolution Fresh and unallocated corporate expenses are reported within Corporate and Other. Revenues from our reportable operating segments as a percentage of total net revenues for fiscal 2020 were as follows: Americas (70%), International (22%) and Channel Development (8%). Our Americas and International segments include both company-operated and licensed stores. Our Americas segment is our most mature business and has achieved significant scale. Certain markets within our International operations are in various stages of development and may require more extensive support, relative to their current levels of revenue and operating income, than our Americas operations. Our Channel Development segment includes roasted whole bean and ground coffees, Seattle's Best Coffee ® , Starbucks- and Teavana-branded single-serve products, a variety of ready-to-drink beverages, such as Frappuccino ® , Starbucks Doubleshot ® , Starbucks Refreshers ® beverages and Teavana TM/MC iced tea, and other branded products sold worldwide outside of our company-operated and licensed stores. A large portion of our Channel Development business operates under a licensed model of the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestlé, while our global ready-to-drink businesses operate under collaborative relationships with PepsiCo, Inc., Anheuser-Busch Companies, LLC, Tingyi-Ashi Beverages Holding Co., Ltd., Arla Foods amba and others. Revenue Components We generate the majority of our revenues through company-operated stores and licensed stores. Company-operated and Licensed Store Summary as of September 27, 2020 Americas As a% of Total Americas Stores International As a% of Total International Stores Total As a% of Total Stores Company-operated stores 10,109 55 % 6,528 46 % 16,637 51 % Licensed stores 8,245 45 % 7,778 54 % 16,023 49 % Total 18,354 100 % 14,306 100 % 32,660 100 % The mix of company-operated versus licensed stores in a given market will vary based on several factors, including our ability to access desirable local retail space, the complexity, profitability and expected ultimate size of the market for Starbucks and our ability to leverage the support infrastructure within a geographic region. 2 Table of Contents Company-operated Stores Revenue from company-operated stores accounted for 81% of total net revenues during fiscal 2020. Our retail objective is to be the leading retailer and brand of coffee and tea in each of our target markets by selling the finest quality coffee, tea and related products, as well as complementary food offerings, and by providing each customer with a unique Starbucks Experience . The Starbucks Experience is built upon superior customer service, convenience and a seamless digital experience as well as safe, clean and well-maintained stores that reflect the personalities of the communities in which they operate, thereby building a high degree of customer loyalty. Our strategy for expanding our global retail business is to increase our category share in a disciplined manner, by selectively opening additional stores in new and existing markets, as well as increasing sales in existing stores, to support our long-term strategic objective to maintain Starbucks standing as one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world. Store growth in specific existing markets will vary due to many factors, including expected financial returns, the maturity of the market, economic conditions, consumer behavior and local business practices.

Our ability to vary the size and format of our stores allows us to locate them in or near a variety of settings, including downtown and suburban retail centers, office buildings, university campuses and rural and off-highway locations. We are continuing the expansion of our stores, particularly drive-thru formats that provide a higher degree of access and convenience, and alternative store formats, which are designed to provide a more streamlined customer experience in dense metropolitan areas. Prior to the novel coronavirus outbreak, known as the global pandemic COVID-19, approximately 80% of Starbucks transactions in U.S. company-operated stores were “on-the-go” occasions. This has prompted us to reexamine our U.S. store footprint and evolve our retail presence over time through targeted store renovations, relocations and new stores. We have since introduced a new store format, Starbucks ® Pickup, to enhance the “on-the-go” customer experience and improve operating efficiency across Starbucks ® stores in certain major metropolitan areas in the Americas. New store formats, such as Starbucks Pickup, are suitable for customers who prefer to order ahead and pay through the Starbucks ® Mobile App for pick-up. In our major international markets, we continue to invest in technology and establish partnerships with third parties with relevant expertise to increase digital adoption to provide convenience and elevate the customer experience. In China, the introduction of Starbucks Now TM stores enables a seamless integration of physical and digital customer touchpoints. Orders may be placed in advance through the Starbucks Mobile App or Starbucks Delivers TM and can be conveniently picked up by customers and delivery riders in these express retail format locations. These strategies align closely with rapidly evolving customer preferences, including higher levels of mobile ordering, more contactless pick-up experiences and reduced in-store congestion, all of which naturally allow for greater physical distancing. We believe our continued efforts to transform our store portfolio and elevate technology will enhance the customer experience and position Starbucks for long-term growth. 3 Table of Contents Retail sales mix by product type for company-operated stores: Fiscal Year Ended Sep 27, 2020 Sep 29, 2019 Sep 30, 2018 Beverages 75 % 74 % 74 % Food 20 % 20 % 20 % Packaged and single-serve coffees and teas 1 % 1 % 2 % Other (1) 4 % 5 % 4 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % (1) “Other” primarily consists of sales of serveware and ready-to-drink beverages, among other items. Stored Value Cards and Loyalty Program The Starbucks Card, our branded stored value card program, is designed to provide customers with a convenient payment method, support gifting and increase the frequency of store visits by cardholders, in part through the related Starbucks ® Rewards loyalty program where available, as discussed below. Stored value cards are issued to customers when they initially load them with an account balance. They can be obtained in our company-operated and most licensed stores in North America, China, Japan and many of our markets in our International segment. Stored value cards can also be obtained online, via the Starbucks ® Mobile App and through other U.S. and international retailers. Customers may access their card balances by utilizing their stored value card or the Starbucks ® Mobile App in participating stores. Using the Mobile Order and Pay functionality of the Starbucks ® Mobile App, customers can also place orders in advance for pick-up at certain participating locations in several markets. In nearly all markets, including the U.S. and Canada, customers who register their Starbucks Cards are automatically enrolled in the Starbucks Rewards program. Registered members can receive various benefits depending on factors such as the number of reward points (“Stars”) earned. Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, in addition to using their Starbucks Cards, Starbucks ® Rewards members can earn Stars by paying with cash, credit or debit cards, or selected mobile wallets at company-operated stores in the U.S. and Canada. Refer to Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, for further discussion of our stored value cards and loyalty program. Licensed Stores Revenues from our licensed stores accounted for 10% of total net revenues in fiscal 2020. Licensed stores generally have a lower gross margin and a higher operating margin than company-operated stores. Under the licensed model, Starbucks receives a margin on branded products and supplies sold to the licensed store operator along with a royalty on retail sales. Licensees are responsible for operating costs and capital investments which more than offset the lower revenues we receive under the licensed store model. In our licensed store operations, we leverage the expertise of our local partners and share our operating and store development experience. Licensees provide improved, and at times the only, access to desirable retail space. Most licensees are prominent retailers with in-depth market knowledge and access. As part of these arrangements, we sell coffee, tea, food and related products to licensees for resale to customers and receive royalties and license fees from the licensees. We also sell certain equipment, such as coffee brewers and espresso machines, to our licensees for use in their operations. Employees working in licensed retail locations are required to follow our detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to employees in company-operated stores. In a limited number of international markets, we also use traditional franchising and include these stores in the results of operations from our other licensed stores. 4 Table of Contents Licensed store data for the year-ended September 27, 2020: Stores Open as of Stores Open as of Sep 29, 2019 Opened Closed Transfers Net Sep 27, 2020 Americas: U.S. 6,250 210 (73) — 137 6,387 Mexico 748 15 (11) — 4 752 Latin America 663 32 (33) — (1) 662 Canada 432 24 (12) 12 444 Total Americas 8,093 281 (129) — 152 8,245 International: Korea 1,334 159 (25) — 134 1,468 U.K. 707 55 (29) 4 30 737 Turkey 494 42 (6) — 36 530 Taiwan 480 32 (11) — 21 501 Indonesia 421 37 — — 37 458 Philippines 397 10 (11) — (1) 396 Thailand 392 20 (7) — 13 405 All Other 3,104 265 (86) — 179 3,283 Total International 7,329 620 (175) 4 449 7,778 Total licensed 15,422 901 (304) 4 601 16,023 Other Revenues Other revenues primarily are recorded in our Channel Development segment and include sales of packaged coffee, tea and ready-to-drink beverages to customers outside of our company-operated and licensed stores, as well as royalties received from Nestlé under the Global Coffee Alliance and other collaborative partnerships. Product Supply Starbucks is committed to selling the finest whole bean coffees and coffee beverages. To ensure compliance with our rigorous coffee standards, we control substantially all coffee purchasing, roasting and packaging and the global distribution of coffee used in our operations. We purchase green coffee beans from multiple coffee-producing regions around the world and custom roast them to our exacting standards for our many blends and single origin coffees. The price of coffee is subject to significant volatility. Although most coffee trades in the commodity market, high-altitude arabica coffee of the quality sought by Starbucks tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the “C” coffee commodity price. Both the premium and the commodity price depend upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase. Supply and price can be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, including weather, natural disasters, crop disease, general increase in farm inputs and costs of production, inventory levels and political and economic conditions. Price is also impacted by trading activities in the arabica coffee futures market, including hedge funds and commodity index funds. In addition, green coffee prices have been affected in the past, and may be affected in the future, by the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies. We buy coffee using fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed purchase commitments, depending on market conditions, to secure an adequate supply of quality green coffee. We also utilize forward contracts, futures contracts and collars to hedge ""C"" price exposure under our price-to-be-fixed green coffee contracts and our long-term forecasted coffee demand where underlying fixed price and price-to-be-fixed contracts are not yet available. Total purchase commitments, together with existing inventory, are expected to provide an adequate supply of green coffee through fiscal 2022. We depend upon our relationships with coffee producers, outside trading companies and exporters for our supply of green coffee. We believe, based on relationships established with our suppliers, the risk of non-delivery on such purchase commitments is remote. To help ensure the future supply of high-quality green coffee and to reinforce our leadership role in the coffee industry, Starbucks operates nine farmer support centers, including our China Farmer Support Center located in the Yunnan Province of 5 Table of Contents this high-growth market. All farmer support centers are staffed with agronomists and sustainability experts who work with coffee farming communities to promote best practices in coffee production designed to improve both coffee quality and yields and agronomy support to address climate and other impacts. In addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products, particularly fluid milk, to support the needs of our company-operated stores. We believe, based on relationships established with our dairy suppliers, that the risk of non-delivery of sufficient fluid milk to support our stores is remote. Products other than whole bean coffees and coffee beverages sold in Starbucks ® stores include tea and a number of ready-to-drink beverages that are purchased from several specialty suppliers, usually under long-term supply contracts. Food products, such as pastries, breakfast sandwiches and lunch items, are purchased from national, regional and local sources. We also purchase a broad range of paper and plastic products, such as cups and cutlery, from several companies to support the needs of our retail stores as well as our manufacturing and distribution operations. We believe, based on relationships established with these suppliers and manufacturers, that the risk of non-delivery of sufficient amounts of these items is remote. Competition Our primary competitors for coffee beverage sales are specialty coffee shops. We believe that our customers choose among specialty coffee retailers primarily on the basis of product quality, service and convenience, as well as price. We continue to experience direct competition from large competitors in the quick-service restaurant sector and the ready-to-drink coffee beverage market, in addition to both well-established and start-up companies in many international markets. We also compete with restaurants and other specialty retailers for prime retail locations and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores. Our coffee and tea products sold through our Channel Development segment compete directly against specialty coffees and teas sold through grocery stores, warehouse clubs, specialty retailers, convenience stores and foodservice accounts and compete indirectly against all other coffees and teas on the market. Trademarks, Copyrights, Patents and Domain Names Starbucks owns and has applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and in other countries throughout the world. Some of our trademarks, including Starbucks, the Starbucks logo, Starbucks Reserve, Seattle’s Best Coffee, Teavana and Frappuccino are of material importance. The duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained. We own numerous copyrights for items such as product packaging, promotional materials, in-store graphics and training materials. We also hold patents on certain products, systems and designs. In addition, Starbucks has registered and maintains numerous Internet domain names, including “Starbucks.com,” “Starbucks.net,” “Starbucksreserve.com,” “Seattlesbest.com” and “Teavana.com.” Seasonality and Quarterly Results Our business is subject to moderate seasonal fluctuations, of which our fiscal second quarter typically experiences lower revenues and operating income. However, the COVID-19 outbreak may have an impact on consumer behaviors and customer traffic that may result in temporary changes in the seasonal fluctuations of our business. Additionally, as Starbucks Cards are issued to and loaded by customers during the holiday season, we tend to have higher cash flows from operations during the first quarter of the fiscal year. However, since revenues from Starbucks Cards are recognized upon redemption and not when cash is loaded onto the Card, the impact of seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings is much less pronounced. As a result of moderate seasonal fluctuations, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year. Government Regulation As a company with global operations, we are subject to the laws of the United States and multiple foreign jurisdictions in which we operate and the rules and regulations of various governing bodies, which may differ among jurisdictions. Compliance with these laws, rules and regulation has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations and competitive position as compared to prior periods. 6 Table of Contents Human Capital Management As a company, Starbucks mission is not only to deliver outstanding financial results by offering exceptional and unique products and services, but to also create a strong connection with the communities where we operate. We believe the strength of our workforce is one of the significant contributors to our success as a global brand that leads with purpose. This is largely attributed to our partners (employees) who strive every day to create a welcoming and inclusive environment for our customers. Therefore, one of our core strategies is to invest in and support our partners to differentiate our brand, products and services in the competitive specialty coffee market, including the following areas of focus: Oversight and Management We recognize the diversity of customers, partners and communities, and believe in creating an inclusive and equitable environment that represents a broad spectrum of backgrounds and cultures. Working under these principles, our Partner Resources Organization is tasked with managing employment-related matters, including recruiting and hiring, onboarding and training, compensation planning, performance management and professional development. Our Board of Directors and Board committees provide oversight on certain human capital matters, including our Inclusion and Diversity programs and initiatives. As noted in its charter, our Compensation and Management Development Committee is responsible for periodically reviewing Starbucks partner resource programs and initiatives, including healthcare and other benefits, as well as our management development and succession planning practices and strategies. Our Audit and Compliance Committee works closely with the Risk Management Committee, led by Starbucks cfo and general counsel, to monitor current and emerging labor and human capital management risks and to mitigate exposure to those risks. Furthermore, our Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee annually evaluates the effectiveness of our social responsibility policies, goals and programs, which also include partner-related issues. These reports and recommendations to the Board and its committees are part of the broader framework that guides how Starbucks should attract, retain and develop a workforce that aligns with our values and strategies. We regularly conduct anonymous surveys to seek feedback from our retail and non-retail partners on a variety of topics, including but not limited to, confidence in company leadership, competitiveness of our compensation and benefits package, career growth opportunities and improvements on how we could make our company an employer of choice. The results are shared with our partners and reviewed by senior leadership, who analyze areas of progress or deterioration and prioritize actions and activities in response to this feedback to drive meaningful improvements in partner engagement. Our management and cross-functional teams also work closely to evaluate human capital management issues such as partner retention, workplace safety, harassment and bullying, as well as to implement measures to mitigate these risks. Total Rewards We have demonstrated a history of investing in our workforce by offering competitive salaries and wages. To foster a stronger sense of ownership and align the interests of partners with shareholders, restricted stock units are provided to eligible non-executive partners under our broad-based stock incentive programs. Furthermore, we offer comprehensive, locally relevant and innovative benefits to all eligible partners. In the U.S , our largest and most mature market, these include, among other benefits: • Comprehensive health insurance coverage is offered to partners working an average of 20 hours or more each week. • 100% tuition coverage is provided to partners who earn a bachelor's degree online at Arizona State University through the Starbucks College Achievement Program. • Parental leaves are provided to all new parents for birth, adoption or foster placement. • A Partner and Family Sick Time program is provided and allows partners to accrue paid sick time based on hours worked and use that time for themselves or family members in need of care. • Care@Work benefit provides partners with subsidized child, adult or senior care planning services. This benefit includes up to 20 days of subsidized backup care services through the end of fiscal 2021, in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. • We view mental health as a fundamental part of our humanity and implemented a comprehensive suite of related programs and benefits in fiscal 2020. These include Headspace, an online application that enables guided mediation, Lyra, which provides mental health coaching, and Starbucks Mental Health Fundamental Training, created in partnership with National Council for Behavioral Health, which offers ongoing training to help partners recognize and respond to signs of mental health and substance use issues. Outside of the U.S., we have provided other innovative benefits to help address market-specific needs, such as providing interest-free loans to our U.K. partners to help cover rental deposits, mental health services in Canada, and in China, a monthly housing subsidy for full-time Starbucks baristas and shift supervisor s , as well as comprehensive health insurance coverage for parents of partners. 7 Table of Contents Role-based Support To help our partners succeed in their roles, we emphasize continuous training and development opportunities. These include, but are not limited to, safety and security protocols, updates on new products and service offerings and deployment of technologies. Training provided through our Pour Over sessions include a wide variety of topics such as achievable goal setting, giving and receiving constructive feedback and effective engagement with customers and communities. To help further promote an inclusive culture and to better serve our customers, we encourage U.S.-based partners to enroll in the To Be Welcoming courses we created in partnership with Arizona State University to address different forms of bias and discrimination. Pay Equity To be an employer of choice and maintain the strength of our workforce, we consistently assess the current business environment and labor market to refine our compensation and benefits programs and other resources available to our partners. We previously achieved and currently maintain 100 percent pay equity in the U.S. for women and men and people of all races for partners performing similar work. We have also achieved gender pay equity in China and Canada, two of our largest markets outside of the U.S., and we made a commitment to achieve gender pay equity in all company-operated markets. As of September 27, 2020, Starbucks employed approximately 349,000 people worldwide. In the U.S., Starbucks employed approximately 228,000 people, with approximately 220,000 in company-operated stores and the remainder in corporate support, store development, roasting, manufacturing, warehousing and distribution operations. Approximately 121,000 employees were employed outside of the U.S., with approximately 118,000 in company-operated stores and the remainder in regional support operations. The number of Starbucks partners represented by unions is not significant. We believe our efforts in managing our workforce have been effective, evidenced by a strong Starbucks culture and a good relationship between the company and our partners.

Risk Factors You should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations section and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. If any of the risks and uncertainties described in the cautionary factors described below actually occur or continue to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, the risks below are not the only risks we face and additional risks not currently known to us or that we presently deem immaterial may emerge or become material at 9 Table of Contents any time and may negatively impact our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations or the trading price of our common stock. Risks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions • Our financial condition and results of operations have been and are expected to continue to be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, known as COVID-19, was first reported and was subsequently declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020. To date, this outbreak has surfaced in nearly all regions around the world, and as the pandemic continues to spread, particularly in the United States, businesses as well as federal, state and local governments have implemented significant actions to attempt to mitigate this public health crisis. Our operations have been and will continue to be disrupted to varying degrees in many markets (from limited operations including only drive-thru and delivery to full store closures in some markets). While we cannot predict the duration or scope of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has negatively impacted our business and such impact has been and is expected to continue to be material to our financial results, condition and outlook. The further spread of COVID-19, and the requirements to take action to mitigate the spread of the pandemic, will impact our ability to carry out our business as usual and may materially adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. Even in regions where we have reopened stores, our stores may be subject to modified hours and operations and/or reduced customer traffic. Moreover, certain of those regions, including parts of China and the United States, have suffered a COVID-19 relapse after reopening. If those regions fail to fully contain COVID-19, or if additional regions suffer multiple COVID-19 relapses, any of those markets may not recover quickly or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. As a result, we may incur additional impairment charges to our inventory, store and corporate assets— and our ability to realize the benefits from deferred tax assets may become limited— any of which may have a significant or material impact on our financial results. On March 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”), which among other things, provides employer payroll tax credits for wages paid to employees who are unable to work during the COVID-19 outbreak and options to defer payroll tax payments for a limited period. Based on our evaluation of the CARES Act, we qualify for certain employer payroll tax credits as well as the deferral of payroll tax payments in the future. Additionally, the Canadian government enacted the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (“CEWS”) to help employers offset a portion of their employee wages for a limited period. We elected to treat qualified government subsidies from the U.S., Canada and other governments as offsets to the related operating expenses. There is no guarantee that we will continue to meet the eligibility requirements to participate in any current or future government relief programs or that the benefits will meaningfully offset the lost revenues and incremental costs incurred. Increased volatility or significant disruption of global financial markets due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic could have a negative impact on our ability to access capital markets and other funding sources, on acceptable terms or at all and impede our ability to comply with debt covenants. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the efficacy, scope and duration of actions to limit the spread of COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others. While such actions have been relaxed or rolled back in certain markets, the actions have been reinstated in certain regions that have suffered relapse, and may be reinstated in additional regions as the pandemic continues to evolve. The scope and timing of any such reinstatements are difficult to predict and may materially affect our future operations. • Our financial condition and results of operations are subject to, and may be adversely affected by, a number of other factors, many of which are also largely outside our control. In addition to the COVID-19 pandemic, our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to a number of other factors, many of which are largely outside our control. Any one or more of the factors listed below or described elsewhere in this risk factors section could have a material adverse impact our business, financial condition and/or results of operations: • increases in real estate costs in certain domestic and international markets; • adverse outcomes of litigation; • severe weather or other natural or man-made disasters affecting a large market or several closely located markets that may temporarily but significantly affect our retail business in such markets; and • especially in our large markets, labor discord or disruption, geopolitical events (including escalating U.S.-China tensions), war, terrorism (including incidents targeting us), political instability, acts of public violence, boycotts, increasing anti-American sentiment in certain markets, hostilities and social unrest and other health pandemics that lead to avoidance of public places or restrictions on public gatherings such as in our stores. 10 Table of Contents • Economic conditions in the U.S. and international markets could adversely affect our business and financial results. As a retailer that is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending, our results of operations are sensitive to changes in or uncertainty about macro-economic conditions. Our customers may have or in the future have less money for discretionary purchases and may stop or reduce their purchases of our products or switch to Starbucks or competitors' lower-priced products as a result of various factors, including job losses, inflation, higher taxes, reduced access to credit, changes in federal economic policy and recent international trade disputes. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we may experience a reduction and/or increased volatility in demand for our products, which may be caused by, among other things: store closures or modified operating hours and business model, reduced customer traffic due to illness, quarantine or government or self-imposed restrictions placed on our stores' operations and changes in consumer spending behaviors (e.g. continued practice of social distancing, decrease in consumer confidence in general macroeconomic conditions and a decrease in consumer discretionary spending). Decreases in customer traffic and/or average value per transaction without a corresponding decrease in costs would put downward pressure on margins and would negatively impact our financial results. There is also a risk that if negative economic conditions or uncertainty, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, persist for a long period of time or worsen, consumers may make long-lasting changes to their discretionary purchasing behavior, including less frequent discretionary purchases on a more permanent basis or there may be a general downturn in the restaurant industry. • Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance and fluctuations in the stock market as a whole will likely adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock. Failure to meet market expectations going forward, particularly with respect to net revenues, operating margins, earnings per share, comparable store sales growth, operating cash flows and shareholder returns, will likely result in a decline and/or increased volatility in the market price of our stock. In addition, price and volume fluctuations in the stock market as a whole may affect the market price of our stock in ways that may be unrelated to our financial performance. Risks Related to Brand Relevance and Brand Execution • Our success depends substantially on the value of our brands and failure to preserve their value could have a negative impact on our financial results. We believe we have built an excellent reputation globally for the quality of our products, for delivery of a consistently positive consumer experience and for our global social impact programs. The Starbucks brand is recognized throughout the world, and we have received high ratings in global brand value studies. To be successful in the future, particularly outside of the U.S. where the Starbucks brand and our other brands are less well-known, we believe we must preserve, grow and leverage the value of our brands across all sales channels. Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities. Business incidents, whether isolated or recurring and whether originating from us or our business partners, that erode consumer trust can significantly reduce brand value, potentially trigger boycotts of our stores or result in civil or criminal liability and can have a negative impact on our financial results. Such incidents include actual or perceived breaches of privacy or violations of domestic or international privacy laws, contaminated food, product recalls, store employees or other food handlers infected with communicable diseases, such as COVID-19, or other potential incidents discussed in this risk factors section. The impact of such incidents may be exacerbated if they receive considerable publicity, including rapidly through social or digital media (including for malicious reasons) or result in litigation. Consumer demand for our products and our brand equity could diminish significantly if we, our employees, licensees or other business partners fail to preserve the quality of our products, act or are perceived to act in an unethical, illegal, racially-biased, unequal or socially irresponsible manner, including with respect to the sourcing, content or sale of our products, service and treatment of customers at Starbucks stores, or the use of customer data for general or direct marketing or other purposes. Additionally, if we fail to comply with laws and regulations, publicly take controversial positions or actions or fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience in each of our markets, including by failing to invest in the right balance of wages and benefits to attract and retain employees that represent the brand well or foster an inclusive and diverse environment, our brand value may be diminished. 11 Table of Contents • If our business partners and third-party providers do not satisfactorily fulfill their responsibilities and commitments, it could damage our brand and our financial results could suffer. Our global business strategy, including our plans for new stores, branded products and other initiatives, relies significantly on a variety of business partners, including licensee and joint venture relationships, third-party manufacturers, distributors and retailers, particularly for our entire global Channel Development business. Licensees, retailers and foodservice operators are often authorized to use our logos and provide branded food, beverage and other products directly to customers. We believe our customers expect the same quality of service regardless of whether they visit a licensed or company-operated store, so we provide training and support to, and monitor the operations of, certain of these licensees and other business partners. However, the product quality and service they deliver may still be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control. We do not have direct control over our business partners, including in their adherence to additional sanitation protocols and guidelines as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and may not have visibility into their practices. We also source our food, beverage and other products from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners and in certain cases such products are produced or sourced by our licensees directly. And although foodservice operators are authorized to use our logos and provide branded products as part of their foodservice business, we do not monitor the quality of non-Starbucks products served in those locations. Additionally, inconsistent uses of our brand and other of our intellectual property assets, as well as failure to protect our intellectual property, can erode consumer trust and our brand value and have a material negative impact on our financial results. • Incidents involving food or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, adulteration, contamination or mislabeling, whether or not accurate, as well as adverse public or medical opinions about the health effects of consuming our products, could harm our business. Instances or reports, whether true or not, of unclean water supply or food-safety issues, such as food or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, adulteration, contamination or mislabeling, either during growing, manufacturing, packaging, storing or preparation, have in the past severely injured the reputations of companies in the food and beverage processing, grocery and quick-service restaurant sectors. Any report linking us to such instances could severely hurt our sales and could possibly lead to product liability claims, litigation (including class actions) and/or temporary store closures. Clean water is critical to the preparation of coffee, tea and other beverages, as well as ice for our cold beverages, and our ability to ensure a clean water and ice supply to our stores can be limited, particularly in some international locations. We are also continuing to incorporate more products in our food and beverage lineup that require freezing or refrigeration, which increases the risk of food safety related incidents if correct temperatures are not maintained due to mechanical malfunction or human error. We also face risk by relying on third-party food suppliers to provide and transport ingredients and finished products to our stores. We monitor the operations of certain of these business partners, but the product quality and service they deliver may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control and it may be difficult to detect contamination or other defect in these products. Furthermore, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there are stricter health regulations and guidelines and increased public concern over food safety standards and controls. Potential food safety incidents, whether at our stores or involving our business partners, could lead to wide public exposure, which could materially harm our business. Additionally, we are evolving our product lineup to include more local or smaller suppliers for some of our products who may not have as rigorous quality and safety systems and protocols as larger or more national suppliers, especially in light of the heightened safety protocols as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, instances of food or beverage-safety issues, even those involving solely the restaurants or stores of competitors or of suppliers or distributors (regardless of whether we use or have used those suppliers or distributors), could, by resulting in negative publicity about us or the foodservice industry in general, adversely affect our sales on a regional or global basis. A decrease in customer traffic as a result of food-safety concerns or negative publicity, or as a result of a temporary closure of any of our stores, product recalls, viral-contaminated food or beverage claims or other food or beverage-safety claims or litigation, could materially harm our business and results of operations. • We may not be successful in implementing important strategic initiatives or effectively managing growth, which may have an adverse impact on our business and financial results. There is no assurance that we will be able to implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations or that they will generate expected returns, which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results. These strategic initiatives are designed to create growth, improve our results of operations and drive long-term shareholder value, and include: • being an employer of choice and investing in employees to deliver a superior customer experience; • building our leadership position around coffee; 12 Table of Contents • driving convenience, brand engagement and digital relationships through our mobile, loyalty, delivery and digital capabilities both domestically and internationally; • simplifying store administrative tasks to allow store partners to better engage with customers; • increasing the scale of the Starbucks store footprint with disciplined global expansion and introducing flexible and unique store formats, including the accelerated development of alternative store formats (such as Starbucks ® Pickup stores, Starbucks Now stores and curbside pickup) in light of the COVID-19 pandemic; • adjusting rapidly to changing customer preferences and behaviors in light of the COVID-19 pandemic; • moving to a more licensed store model in some markets and a more company-owned model in other markets; • creating new occasions in stores across all dayparts with new product offerings, including our growing lunch food and beverage product lineup; • continuing the global growth of our Channel Development business through our supply, distribution and licensing agreements with Nestlé and other Channel Development business partners; • delivering continued growth in our cold beverage business, including our tea business through the Teavana brand in our Starbucks ® retail stores and other channels and internationally; and • reducing our operating costs, particularly general and administrative expenses. In addition to other factors listed in this risk factors section, factors that may adversely affect the successful implementation of these initiatives, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results, include the following: • imposition of additional taxes by jurisdictions, such as on certain types of beverages or based on number of employees; • construction cost increases associated with new store openings and remodeling of existing stores; delays in store openings for reasons beyond our control or a lack of desirable real estate locations available for lease at reasonable rates, either of which could keep us from meeting annual store opening targets in the U.S. and internationally; • governmental regulations or other health guidelines concerning operations of stores due to the COVID-19 pandemic; • not successfully scaling our supply chain infrastructure as our product offerings increase and as we continue to expand, including our emphasis on a broad range of high-quality food offerings; and • the deterioration in our credit ratings, which could limit the availability of additional financing and increase the cost of obtaining financing to fund our initiatives. Effectively managing growth can be challenging, particularly as we expand into new markets internationally where we must balance the need for flexibility and a degree of autonomy for local management against the need for consistency with our goals, philosophy and standards. If we are not successful in implementing our strategic initiatives, such as large acquisitions and integrations, we may be required to evaluate whether certain assets, including goodwill and other intangibles, have become impaired. In the event we record an impairment charge, it could have a material impact on our financial results. • Evolving consumer preferences and tastes may adversely affect our business. Our continued success depends on our ability to retain and convert customers. Our financial results could be adversely affected by a shift in consumer spending away from outside-the-home food and beverages (such as the disruption caused by online commerce that results in reduced foot traffic to “brick & mortar” retail stores); lack of customer acceptance of new products (including due to price increases necessary to cover the costs of new products or higher input costs), brands (such as the global expansion of the Starbucks brand) and platforms (such as features of our mobile technology, changes in our loyalty rewards programs and our delivery services initiatives); or customers reducing their demand for our current offerings as new products are introduced. In addition, some of our products contain caffeine, dairy products, sugar and other compounds and allergens, the health effects of which are the subject of public and regulatory scrutiny, including the suggestion of linkages to a variety of adverse health effects. Particularly in the U.S., there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks, including obesity, as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food and beverage products. While we have a variety of beverage and food items, including items that are coffee-free and have reduced calories, an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in our products, whether accurate or not, imposition of additional taxes on certain types of food and beverage components, or negative publicity or litigation arising from certain health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our beverages and food products and could materially harm our business and results of operations. Furthermore, our financial results have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in a disruption of customer routines, changes to employer “work- 13 Table of Contents from-home” policies, reduced business and recreational travel and changes in consumer behavior and the ability or willingness to spend discretionary income on our products. Risks Related to Cybersecurity and Data Privacy • The unauthorized access, use, theft or destruction of customer or employee personal, financial or other data or of Starbucks proprietary or confidential information that is stored in our information systems or by third parties on our behalf could impact our reputation and brand and expose us to potential liability and loss of revenues. Many of our information technology systems (and those of our licensees and other third-party business partners, whether cloud-based or hosted in proprietary servers), including those used for our point-of-sale, web and mobile platforms, online and mobile payment systems, delivery services and rewards programs and administrative functions, contain personal, financial or other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and employees. Many of our information technology systems also contain Starbucks proprietary and other confidential information related to our business, such as business plans, product development initiatives and designs. Similar to many other retail companies and because of the prominence of our brand, we are consistently subject to attempts to compromise our information technology systems. Similar to other companies, the number and frequency of these attempts varies from year to year but could be exacerbated to some extent by an increase in our digital operations in our efforts to comply with state and local mandates in response to COVID-19. To the extent we or a third party were to experience a material breach of our or such third parties' information technology systems that result in the unauthorized access, theft, use, destruction or other compromises of customers' or employees' data or confidential information of the Company stored in such systems, including through cyber-attacks or other external or internal methods, it could result in a material loss of revenues from the potential adverse impact to our reputation and brand, our ability to retain or attract new customers and the potential disruption to our business and plans. Such security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable U.S. and international privacy and other laws, and subject us to private consumer, business partner, or securities litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings, any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability. For example, the European Union adopted a new regulation that became effective in May 2018, called the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data, including its use, protection and transfer and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves. Failure to meet the GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of annual worldwide revenue. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on certain individuals and associations. Additionally, the California Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), which was enacted in June 2018 and came into effect on January 1, 2020, provides a new private right of action for data breaches and requires companies that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices and allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties. Our reputation and brand and our ability to attract new customers could also be adversely impacted if we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to properly respond to security breaches of our or third party’s information technology systems. Such failure to properly respond could also result in similar exposure to liability. Compliance with the GDPR, the CCPA and other current and future applicable international and U.S. privacy, cybersecurity and related laws can be costly and time-consuming. Significant capital investments and other expenditures could also be required to remedy cybersecurity problems and prevent future breaches, including costs associated with additional security technologies, personnel, experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached. These costs, which could be material, could adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred and may not meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to breach our information technology systems. Media or other reports of existing or perceived security vulnerabilities in our systems or those of our third-party business partners or service providers can also adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially impact our business. Additionally, the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyber-attacks and breach information technology systems, as well as the sources and targets of these attacks, change frequently and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time. We continue to make significant investments in technology, third-party services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyber-attacks and to prevent or minimize breaches of our information technology systems or data loss, but these security measures cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches or data loss. • We rely heavily on information technology in our operations and growth initiatives, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate and grow our business and could adversely affect our financial results. We rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations for numerous purposes including for administrative functions, point-of-sale processing and payment in our stores and online, management of our supply chain, Starbucks Cards, online business, delivery services, mobile technology, including mobile payments and ordering apps, reloads and loyalty functionality and various other processes and transactions, and many of these systems are interdependent on one another for their functionality. Additionally, the success of several of our initiatives to drive growth, including our ability to increase digital 14 Table of Contents relationships with our customers to drive incremental traffic and spend, is highly dependent on our technology systems. Furthermore, due to social distancing measures put in place as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have accelerated the transformation of our store portfolio by expanding convenience-led formats, which depend heavily on our mobile ordering capabilities. We also rely on third-party providers and platforms for some of these information technology systems and support. Additionally, our systems hardware, software and services provided by third-party service providers are not fully redundant within a market or across our markets. Although we have operational safeguards in place, they may not be effective in preventing the failure of these systems or platforms to operate effectively and be available. Such failures may be caused by various factors, including power outages, catastrophic events, physical theft, computer and network failures, inadequate or ineffective redundancy, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or platforms, flaws in third-party software or services, errors or improper use by our employees or third party service providers, or a breach in the security of these systems or platforms, including through cyber-attacks such as those that result in the blockage of our or our third-party business partners’ or service providers’ systems and platforms and those discussed in more detail in this risk factors section. If our incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective manner they could result in an interruption in our operations and could cause material negative impacts to our product availability and sales, the efficiency of our operations and our financial results. In addition, remediation of any problems with our systems could result in significant, unplanned expenses. Risks Related to Labor and Supply Chain • Our reliance on key business partners may adversely affect our business and operations. The growth of our business relies on the ability of our licensee partners to implement our growth platforms and product innovations as well as on the degree to which we are able to enter into, maintain, develop and negotiate appropriate terms and conditions of, and enforce, commercial and other agreements and the performance of our business partners under such agreements. Our international joint venture partners or licensees may face capital constraints or other factors that may limit the speed at which they are able to expand and develop in a certain market. Our Channel Development business is heavily reliant on Nestlé, which acquired the right to sell and distribute our packaged goods and foodservice products to retailers and operators, with few exceptions. If Nestlé fails to perform its distribution and marketing commitments under our agreements and/or fails to support, protect and grow our brand in Channel Development, our Channel Development business could be adversely impacted for a period of time, present long-term challenges to our brand, limit our ability to grow our Channel Development business and have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results. Additionally, the growth of our Channel Development business is in part dependent on the level of discretionary support provided by our retail and licensed store businesses. There are generally a relatively small number of licensee partners operating in specific markets. If they are not able to access sufficient funds or financing, or are otherwise unable or unwilling to successfully operate and grow their businesses it could have a material adverse effect on our results in the markets. Our business partners may be materially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and may not have sufficient financial support and capital to remain financially solvent and may not have the ability to meet their development goals and targets. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our financial results have been and could continue to be adversely affected by the disruption to the operations of our business partners, including licensee and joint venture relationships, third-party manufacturers, distributors and retailers, through the effects of business and facilities closures, reductions in operating hours, social, economic, political or labor instability in affected areas, transportation delays, travel restrictions and changes in operating procedures, including for additional cleaning and safety protocols. • Increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities or decreases in the availability of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results. The availability and prices of coffee beans and other commodities are subject to significant volatility. We purchase, roast and sell high-quality whole bean arabica coffee beans and related coffee products. The high-quality arabica coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the “C” price. This premium depends upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and the amount of the premium can vary significantly. Increases in the “C” coffee commodity price increase the price of high-quality arabica coffee and also impact our ability to enter into fixed-price purchase commitments. We frequently enter into supply contracts whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore price, at which the base “C” coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established. The supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, such as weather (including the potential effects of climate change), natural disasters, crop disease, general increase in farm inputs and costs of production, inventory levels, political and economic conditions and the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies. Speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices. Because of the significance of 15 Table of Contents coffee beans to our operations, combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities, increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. In addition, if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or to a worldwide or regional shortage, we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee, which could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. We also purchase significant amounts of dairy products, particularly fluid milk, to support the needs of our company-operated retail stores. Additionally, and although less significant to our operations than coffee or dairy, other commodities, including but not limited to tea and those related to food and beverage inputs, such as cocoa, produce, baking ingredients, meats, eggs and energy, as well as the processing of these inputs, are important to our operations. Increases in the cost of dairy products and other commodities, or lack of availability, whether due to supply shortages, delays or interruptions in processing, or otherwise, especially in international markets, could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. • Interruption of our supply chain could affect our ability to produce or deliver our products and could negatively impact our business and profitability. Any material interruption in our supply chain, such as material interruption of roasted coffee supply due to the casualty loss of any of our roasting plants, interruptions in service by our third-party logistic service providers or common carriers that ship goods within our distribution channels, trade restrictions, such as increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes or customs restrictions, pandemics, social or labor unrest, natural disasters or political disputes and military conflicts that cause a material disruption in our supply chain could have a negative material impact on our business and our profitability. Additionally, our food, beverage and other products are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners in our supply chain operations, and in certain cases are produced or sourced by our licensees directly. We rely on these suppliers to provide high quality products and to comply with applicable laws. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge as we increase our fresh and prepared food offerings, especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the U.S. and from countries or regions with diminished infrastructure, developing or failing economies or which are experiencing political instability or social unrest. For certain products, we may rely on one or very few suppliers. A supplier's failure to meet our standards, provide products in a timely and efficient manner, or comply with applicable laws is beyond our control. These issues could have a material negative impact on our business and profitability. • Changes in the availability of and the cost of labor could adversely affect our business. Our business could be adversely impacted by increases in labor costs, including wages and benefits, which, in a retail business such as ours, are two of our most significant costs, both domestically and internationally, including those increases triggered by regulatory actions regarding wages, scheduling and benefits; increased health care and workers’ compensation insurance costs; increased wages and costs of other benefits necessary to attract and retain high quality employees with the right skill sets and increased wages, benefits and costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The growth of our business can make it increasingly difficult to locate and hire sufficient numbers of key employees, to maintain an effective system of internal controls for a globally dispersed enterprise and to train employees worldwide to deliver a consistently high-quality product and customer experience, which could materially harm our business and results of operations. Furthermore, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we could experience a shortage of labor for store positions as concern over exposure to COVID-19 and other factors could decrease the pool of available qualified talent for key functions. In addition, our wages and benefits programs, combined with the challenging conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic, may be insufficient to attract and retain the best talent. • The loss of key personnel or difficulties recruiting and retaining qualified personnel could adversely impact our business and financial results. Much of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of senior management personnel. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key senior management personnel could harm our business. Our success also depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of our retail store employees on whom we rely to give customers a superior in-store experience and elevate our brand. Accordingly, our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain high quality management personnel and other employees to work in and manage our stores, both domestically and internationally. Our ability to attract and retain both corporate and retail personnel is also acutely impacted in certain international and domestic markets where the competition for a relatively small number of qualified employees is intense or in markets where large high-tech companies are able to offer more competitive salaries and benefits. Additionally, there is intense competition for qualified technology systems developers necessary to develop and implement new technologies for our growth initiatives, including increasing our digital relationships with customers. If we are unable to recruit, retain and motivate employees sufficiently to maintain our current business and support our projected growth, our business and financial performance may be adversely affected. 16 Table of Contents Risks Related to Competition • We face intense competition in each of our channels and markets, which could lead to reduced profitability. The specialty coffee market is intensely competitive, including with respect to product quality, innovation, service, convenience, such as delivery service and mobile ordering, and price, and we face significant and increasing competition in all these areas in each of our channels and markets. Accordingly, we do not have leadership positions in all channels and markets. In the U.S., the ongoing focus by large competitors in the quick-service restaurant sector on selling high-quality specialty coffee beverages could lead to decreases in customer traffic to Starbucks ® stores and/or average value per transaction adversely affecting our sales and results of operations. Similarly, continued competition from well-established competitors, or competition from large new entrants or well-funded smaller companies in our domestic and international markets could hinder growth and adversely affect our sales and results of operations in those markets. Many small competitors also continue to open coffee specialty stores in many of our markets across the world, which in the aggregate may also lead to significant decreases of customer traffic to our stores in those markets. Increased competition globally in packaged coffee and tea and single-serve and ready-to-drink coffee beverage markets, including from new and large entrants to this market, could adversely affect the profitability of the Channel Development segment. Furthermore, declines in general consumer demand for specialty coffee products for any reason, including due to consumer preference for other products, flattening demand for our products, changed customer daily routines or traffic to stores as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, or changed customer spending behaviors due to challenging economic conditions, could have a negative effect on our business. Risks Related to Operating a Global Business • We are highly dependent on the financial performance of our Americas operating segment. Our financial performance is highly dependent on our Americas operating segment, as it comprised approximately 70% of consolidated total net revenues in fiscal 2020. If the Americas operating segment revenue trends slow or decline, or does not successfully recover in the post COVID-19 environment, especially in our U.S. market, our other segments may be unable to make up any significant shortfall and our business and financial results could be adversely affected. And because the Americas segment is relatively mature and produces the large majority of our operating cash flows, such a slowdown or decline could result in reduced cash flows for funding the expansion of our international businesses and other initiatives and for returning cash to shareholders. • We are increasingly dependent on the success of certain international markets in order to achieve our growth targets. Our future growth increasingly depends on the growth and sustained profitability of certain international markets. Some or all of our international market business units (“MBUs”), which we generally define by the countries in which they operate, may not be successful in their operations or in achieving expected growth, which ultimately requires achieving consistent, stable net revenues and earnings. The performance of these international operations may be adversely affected by economic downturns in one or more of the countries in which our large MBUs operate. A decline in performance of one or more of our significant international MBUs could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results. The International segment is a significant profit center driving our global returns, along with our Americas segment. In particular, our China MBU contributes meaningfully to both consolidated and International net revenues and operating income. China is currently our fastest growing market, our second largest market overall and 100% company-owned. Due to the significance of our China market for our profit and growth, we are exposed to risks in China, including the risks mentioned elsewhere and the following: • the effects of current U.S.-China relations, including rounds of tariff increases and retaliations and increasing restrictive regulations, potential boycotts and increasing anti-Americanism; • escalating U.S.-China tension and increasing political sensitivities in China; • the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related governmental regulations and restrictions on our operations in China; • entry of new competitors to the specialty coffee market in China; • changes in economic conditions in China and potential negative effects to the growth of its middle class, wages, labor, inflation discretionary spending and real estate and supply chain costs; • ongoing government regulatory reform, including relating to public health, food safety, tariffs and tax, sustainability, bringing uncertainty and inconsistent interpretations, which may be contrary to ours, as well as potential significant increases in compliance costs; and • food-safety related matters, including compliance with food-safety regulations and ability to ensure product quality and safety. 17 Table of Contents Additionally, some factors that will be critical to the success of our international operations overall are different than those affecting our U.S. stores and licensees. Tastes naturally vary by region, and consumers in some MBUs may not embrace our products to the same extent as consumers in the U.S. or other international markets. Occupancy costs and store operating expenses can be higher internationally than in the U.S. due to higher rents for prime store locations or costs of compliance with country-specific regulatory requirements. Because many of our international operations are in an early phase of development, operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues are often higher compared to more developed operations. • We face risks as a global business that could adversely affect our financial performance. We operate in over 80 markets globally. Our international operations are also subject to additional inherent risks of conducting business abroad, such as: • foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, or requirements to transact in specific currencies; • changes or uncertainties in economic, legal, regulatory, social and political conditions in our markets, as well as negative effects on U.S. businesses due to increasing anti-American sentiment in certain markets; • interpretation and application of laws and regulations, including tax, tariffs, labor, merchandise, anti-bribery and privacy laws and regulations; • uncertainties and effects of the implementation of the United Kingdom's referendum to withdraw membership from the European Union (referred to as “Brexit”), including financial, legal, tax and trade implications; • restrictive actions of foreign or U.S. governmental authorities affecting trade and foreign investment, especially during periods of heightened tension between the U.S. and such foreign governmental authorities, including protective measures such as export and customs duties and tariffs, government intervention favoring local competitors and restrictions on the level of foreign ownership; • import or other business licensing requirements; • the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights; • limitations on the repatriation of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions due to current or new U.S. and international regulations; • in developing economies, the growth rate in the portion of the population achieving sufficient levels of disposable income may not be as fast as we forecast; • difficulty in staffing, developing and managing foreign operations and supply chain logistics, including ensuring the consistency of product quality and service, due to governmental actions affecting supply chain logistics, distance, language and cultural differences, as well as challenges in recruiting and retaining high quality employees in local markets; • local laws that make it more expensive and complex to negotiate with, retain or terminate employees; • local regulations, health guidelines and safety protocols related to the COVID-19 pandemic affecting our store operations; and • delays in store openings for reasons beyond our control, competition with locally relevant competitors or a lack of desirable real estate locations available for lease at reasonable rates, any of which could keep us from meeting annual store opening targets and, in turn, negatively impact net revenues, operating income and earnings per share. Moreover, many of the foregoing risks are particularly acute in developing countries, which are important to our long-term growth prospects. Risks Related to Governmental and Regulatory Changes • Failure to comply with applicable laws and changing legal and regulatory requirements could harm our business and financial results. Our policies and procedures are designed to comply with all applicable laws, accounting and reporting requirements, tax rules and other regulations and requirements, including those imposed by the SEC, Nasdaq and foreign countries, as well as applicable trade, labor, healthcare, food and beverage, sanitation, safety, environmental, labeling, anti-bribery and corruption and merchandise laws. Changes in applicable environmental regulations, including increased or additional regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, to discourage the use of plastic or to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use, may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures, incremental investments and other financial obligations for us and our business partners, which could affect our profitability. Furthermore, due to the COVID-19 18 Table of Contents pandemic, we are subject to additional domestic and foreign governmental regulations and health guidelines, as well as any other voluntary safety protocols. In addition, our business is subject to complex and rapidly evolving U.S. and international laws and regulations regarding data privacy and data protection, and companies are under increased regulatory scrutiny relating to these matters. The Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are also interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of data. The interpretation and application of existing laws and regulations regarding data privacy and data protection are in flux and authorities around the world are considering a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals in this area. Current and future data privacy and data protection laws and regulations (including the GDPR and the CCPA, discussed in more detail in this risk factors section, and other applicable international and U.S. privacy laws), or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may limit our ability to collect and use data, require us to otherwise modify our data processing practices and policies or result in the possibility of fines, litigation or orders, which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The burdens imposed by these and other laws and regulations that may be enacted, or new interpretations of existing and future laws and regulations, may also require us to incur substantial costs in reaching compliance in a manner adverse to our business. In addition, the European Commission in July 2016 and the Swiss Government in January 2017 approved the EU-U.S. and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks, respectively, which are designed to allow U.S. companies that self-certify to the U.S. Department of Commerce and publicly commit to comply with the Privacy Shield requirements to freely import personal data from the EU and Switzerland. However, these frameworks face a number of legal challenges and their validity remains subject to legal, regulatory and political developments in both Europe and the U.S. The EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework approved by the European Commission, which is relied upon for transfers of personal data outside the European Economic Area could be invalidated by the Court of Justice of the European Union. The potential invalidation of this mechanism could have a significant adverse impact on our ability to process and transfer personal data outside of the European Economic Area. The complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance are both increasing due to additional or changing legal and regulatory requirements, our ongoing expansion into new markets and new channels and the fact that foreign laws occasionally conflict with domestic laws. In addition to potential damage to our reputation and brand, failure by us or our business partners to comply with the various applicable laws and regulations, as well as changes in laws and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied, may result in litigation, civil and criminal liability, damages, fines and penalties, increased cost of regulatory compliance and restatements of our financial statements and have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. All references to store counts, including data for new store openings, are reported net of related store closures, unless otherwise noted. Overview Starbucks results for fiscal 2020 reflect the challenges our business faced with the COVID-19 pandemic, which severely impacted our results, particularly during the second and third fiscal quarters. Consolidated revenues declined 11% to $23.5 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to $26.5 billion in fiscal 2019 driven by temporary closures of a significant number of our company-operated and licensed stores, as well as modified business operations and reduced customer traffic. We gradually reopened our stores and, since then, have seen sequential improvements in comparable store sales in both our Americas and International segments as transaction volumes continue to climb, reflecting the resilience of our business model and the strength of our brand. Comparable store sales for the Americas segment declined by 12% for fiscal 2020, primarily due to the temporary store closures, reduced customer traffic and shortened store hours. The most negative impacts occurred during the third quarter of fiscal 2020. Most company-operated and licensed stores were re-opened as of early May, and over 60% of company-operated stores in the U.S. provided limited seating by the end of the fiscal year. To help protect the health and welfare of our partners, we incurred incremental labor costs, including paying the wages and benefits to partners who were either unable or uncomfortable working from mid-March through May, a temporary wage increase for partners who continued working during this period and additional benefits to furloughed or separated partners resulting from reduced store hours. The incremental wages incurred were partially offset by qualified tax credits provided by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) and the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (“CEWS”). In June 2020, we announced a plan to optimize our North America store portfolio, primarily in dense, metropolitan markets, by blending store formats to better cater to changing customer tastes and preferences. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we closed approximately 100 stores in the U.S. and Canada, and we expect to close an additional 700 stores in those markets over the next 18 months. This reflects an additional 200 store closures than the initial announcement estimate of 600 stores. Costs incurred related to the restructuring efforts are recorded as restructuring and impairments on our consolidated statement of earnings and will continue to be recorded in accordance with the anticipated timeline of store closures. For the International segment, comparable store sales declined by 19% for fiscal 2020, mostly due to the 31% and 37% reduction in comparable store sales during the second and third fiscal quarters of 2020, respectively. Company-operated stores in the China market began re-opening in the fiscal second quarter, and nearly all company-operated stores were open by the end of the fiscal third quarter. To support our international licensees in their recovery efforts, we extended more flexible development and financial terms, including waiving royalty payments during the fiscal third quarter. Revenue for our Channel Development segment declined $68 million, or 3%, when compared with fiscal 2019. This is largely due to the lapping of Global Coffee Alliance transition-related activities, including higher inventory sales in the prior year as Nestlé prepared to fulfill customer orders. These are partially offset by the continued growth of the Global Coffee Alliance during fiscal 2020. Throughout the second half of fiscal 2020, we experienced initial business recovery as our stores gradually reopened under modified operations to meet public health guidelines and evolving customer behaviors and expectations. As of September 27, 2020, nearly all of our company-operated and licensed stores were re-opened. Those that have remained closed are located in travel or transportation hubs as well as central business districts. Our global business is recovering steadily, with China approaching comparable store sales recovery and the U.S. demonstrating continued upward momentum in sales and profitability. Our Channel Development segment continues to grow category share as customers adjust to their at-home routines. In fiscal 2021, we expect lower revenues for the segment as we transitioned our single-serve coffee business to a more royalty-based model. We do not expect the change to have a material impact on our earnings. However, the change is anticipated to have an accretive impact on operating margin for the segment. We continue to invest in technologies and innovations to elevate the customer and partner experience and to drive long-term growth. By reimagining our store formats, we are moving swiftly to adapt to new customer behaviors. Absent significant COVID-19 relapses or global economic disruptions, and based on the current trend of our retail business recovery and our focused efforts to expand contactless customer experiences, digital capabilities and beverage innovation, we believe we are well positioned to regain the positive business momentum we had demonstrated prior to the pandemic. Financial Highlights • Total net revenues decreased 11% to $23.5 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to $26.5 billion in fiscal 2019. 25 Table of Contents • Consolidated operating income decreased to $1.6 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to operating income of $4.1 billion in fiscal 2019. Fiscal 2020 operating margin was 6.6% compared to 15.4% in fiscal 2019. Operating margin contraction was primarily driven by sales deleverage and additional costs incurred attributable to COVID-19, including catastrophe pay and enhanced pay programs for retail store partners, net of benefits provided by government subsidies. Higher restructuring activities related to our Americas store portfolio optimization and investments to support key business partners also contributed. These decreases were partially offset by sales leverage realized in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 prior to the onset of COVID-19 impacts and supply chain efficiencies. • Earnings per share (“EPS”) for fiscal 2020 decreased to $0.79, compared to EPS of $2.92 in fiscal 2019. The decrease was primarily driven by the adverse impacts of COVID-19, including lower revenues due to temporary store closures, reduced customer traffic and modified operations, as well as incremental labor expenses and restructuring costs. • Capital expenditures were $1.5 billion in fiscal 2020 compared to $1.8 billion in fiscal 2019 primarily due to a pause in new store openings due to COVID-19. • We returned $3.6 billion to our shareholders in fiscal 2020 through share repurchases and dividends compared to $12.0 billion in fiscal 2019. We temporarily suspended our share repurchase program in March 2020.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — FISCAL 2020 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2019 Consolidated results of operations (in millions) : Revenues Fiscal Year Ended Sep 27, 2020 Sep 29, 2019 % Change Net revenues: Company-operated stores $ 19,164.6 $ 21,544.4 (11.0) % Licensed stores 2,327.1 2,875.0 (19.1) Other 2,026.3 2,089.2 (3.0) Total net revenues $ 23,518.0 $ 26,508.6 (11.3) % Total net revenues decreased $3.0 billion, or 11%, over fiscal 2019, primarily due to lower revenues from company-operated stores ($2.4 billion). The decline in company-operated store revenue was due to a 14% decrease in comparable store sales ($2.9 billion), attributable to a 22% decrease in comparable transactions, partially offset by a 10% increase in average ticket. Also contributing to the decrease were the conversions of our retail businesses in Thailand, France and the Netherlands to fully licensed markets during fiscal 2019 ($204 million). Partially offsetting these decreases were the incremental revenues from 806 net new Starbucks ® company-operated store openings, or a 5% increase, over the past 12 months ($718 million). Licensed stores revenue declined by $548 million, driven by lower product and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees. Other revenues decreased $63 million, primarily due to the lapping of a higher volume of transition activities related to the Global Coffee Alliance and the Tazo brand sale, partially offset by higher sales from the growth of the Global Coffee Alliance. 26 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Fiscal Year Ended Sep 27, 2020 Sep 29, 2019 Sep 27, 2020 Sep 29, 2019 As a % of Total Net Revenues Product and distribution costs $ 7,694.9 $ 8,526.9 32.7 % 32.2 % Store operating expenses 10,764.0 10,493.6 45.8 39.6 Other operating expenses 430.3 371.0 1.8 1.4 Depreciation and amortization expenses 1,431.3 1,377.3 6.1 5.2 General and administrative expenses 1,679.6 1,824.1 7.1 6.9 Restructuring and impairments 278.7 135.8 1.2 0.5 Total operating expenses 22,278.8 22,728.7 94.7 85.7 Income from equity investees 322.5 298.0 1.4 1.1 Operating income $ 1,561.7 $ 4,077.9 6.6 % 15.4 % Store operating expenses as a % of related revenues 56.2 % 48.7 % Product and distribution costs as a percentage of total net revenues increased 50 basis points, primarily due to sales deleverage attributable to COVID-19 impacts, which included inventory write-offs and product waste (approximately 10 basis points), partially offset by supply chain efficiencies (approximately 60 basis points). Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 620 basis points. Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues increased 750 basis points, primarily due to sales deleverage attributable to COVID-19 impacts, which included catastrophe pay and enhanced pay programs for retail partners, net of benefits provided by temporary subsidies from the U.S. and certain foreign governments (approximately 150 basis points). Other operating expenses increased $59 million, primarily due to incremental costs to develop and grow the Global Coffee Alliance. Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 90 basis points, primarily due to sales deleverage. General and administrative expenses decreased $145 million, primarily driven by lower performance-based compensation ($63 million), lapping of the 2018 U.S stock award granted in fiscal 2018, which was funded by savings from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017 (“Tax Act”) and vested in fiscal 2019 ($61 million), and lapping of the 2019 Starbucks Leadership Experience in Chicago ($52 million), partially offset by incremental strategic investments in technology. Restructuring and impairment expenses increased $143 million, primarily due to higher asset impairment related to our North America store portfolio optimization ($136 million), higher lease-related costs associated with the closure of certain company-operated stores ($28 million) and intangible asset impairment related to changes in our branding and marketing strategies ($22 million). Partially offsetting theses increases were lower severance costs ($38 million) and lapping the impairment related to our Switzerland retail market ($10 million). Income from equity investees increased $25 million, primarily due to higher income from our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture and growth in our South Korea joint venture. The combination of these changes resulted in an overall decrease in operating margin of 880 basis points in fiscal 2020 when compared to fiscal 2019. 27 Table of Contents Other Income and Expenses Fiscal Year Ended Sep 27, 2020 Sep 29, 2019 Sep 27, 2020 Sep 29, 2019 As a % of Total Net Revenues Operating income $ 1,561.7 $ 4,077.9 6.6 % 15.4 % Net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations — 622.8 — 2.3 Interest income and other, net 39.7 96.5 0.2 0.4 Interest expense (437.0) (331.0) (1.9) (1.2) Earnings before income taxes 1,164.4 4,466.2 5.0 16.8 Income tax expense 239.7 871.6 1.0 3.3 Net earnings including noncontrolling interests 924.7 3,594.6 3.9 13.6 Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests (3.6) (4.6) — — Net earnings attributable to Starbucks $ 928.3 $ 3,599.2 3.9 % 13.6 % Effective tax rate including noncontrolling interests 20.6 % 19.5 % Net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations decreased $623 million due to lapping the sale of retail operations in Thailand, France and the Netherlands in fiscal 2019. Interest income and other, net decreased $57 million, primarily due to lower interest rates and lapping the gain on the sale of a non-operating asset. Interest expense increased $106 million primarily due to additional interest incurred on long-term debt issued in March 2020 and May 2020. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2020 was 20.6% compared to 19.5% for fiscal 2019. The increase was primarily due to the valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets of certain international jurisdictions (approximately 980 basis points). This unfavorable impact was partially offset by lower pre-tax earnings including the foreign rate differential on our jurisdictional mix of earnings (approximately 340 basis points), stock-based compensation excess tax benefits in relation to pre-tax earnings (approximately 250 basis points), remeasurement of deferred tax assets due to enacted corporate rate change (approximately 220 basis points) and the impact of changes in indefinite reinvestment assertions for certain foreign subsidiaries in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 (approximately 170 basis points).

Also contributing were lower product and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($354 million). These decreases were partially offset by 134 net new Starbucks ® company-operated stores, or a 1% increase, over the past 12 months ($436 million). Operating Margin Americas operating income for fiscal 2020 decreased 52% to $1.8 billion, compared to $3.8 billion in fiscal 2019. Operating margin decreased 960 basis points to 11.1%, primarily due to sales deleverage attributed to reduced labor productivity and additional costs incurred as a result of COVID-19, mainly catastrophe pay and enhanced pay programs for retail store partners incurred primarily during the fiscal third quarter, net of benefits provided by the CARES Act and CEWS (approximately 180 basis points). Higher restructuring expenses relating to our North America portfolio optimization (approximately 130 basis points) also contributed to the decrease. Partially offsetting these decreases were sales leverage realized prior to the onset of COVID-19 and pricing increases. 29 Table of Contents International Fiscal Year Ended Sep 27, 2020 Sep 29, 2019 Sep 27, 2020 Sep 29, 2019 As a % of International Total Net Revenues Net revenues: Company-operated stores $ 4,385.8 $ 5,256.2 85.2 % 84.9 % Licensed stores 734.2 917.0 14.3 14.8 Other 27.6 17.5 0.5 0.3 Total net revenues 5,147.6 6,190.7 100.0 100.0 Product and distribution costs 1,682.0 1,894.9 32.7 30.6 Store operating expenses 2,276.0 2,428.5 44.2 39.2 Other operating expenses 141.3 116.4 2.7 1.9 Depreciation and amortization expenses 518.4 511.5 10.1 8.3 General and administrative expenses 279.4 317.9 5.4 5.1 Restructuring and impairments (1.2) 59.2 — 1.0 Total operating expenses 4,895.9 5,328.4 95.1 86.1 Income from equity investees 102.3 102.4 2.0 1.7 Operating income $ 354.0 $ 964.7 6.9 % 15.6 % Re venues International total net revenues for fiscal 2020 decreased $1.0 billion, or 17%, primarily due to a 19% decrease in comparable store sales ($931 million) driven by a 23% decrease in transactions, partially offset by a 5% increase in average ticket. Also contributing were lower product sales and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from licensees ($199 million) and the conversions of our retail businesses in Thailand, France and the Netherlands to fully licensed markets during fiscal 2019 ($186 million). These decreases were partially offset by 672 net new Starbucks ® company-operated stores, or an 11% increase, over the past 12 months ($282 million). Operating Margin International operating income for fiscal 2020 decreased 63% to $354 million, compared to $965 million in fiscal 2019. Operating margin decreased 870 basis points to 6.9%, primarily driven by sales deleverage concentrated in the second and third quarters of fiscal 2020 attributable to COVID-19, including continued partner wages and benefits as well as occupancy costs. Royalty relief granted to licensees during the third fiscal quarter also contributed to the decline (approximately 80 basis points). 30 Table of Contents Channel Development Fiscal Year Ended Sep 27, 2020 Sep 29, 2019 Sep 27, 2020 Sep 29, 2019 As a % of Channel Development Total Net Revenues Net revenues $ 1,925.0 $ 1,992.6 Product and distribution costs 1,338.1 1,390.0 69.5 69.8 Other operating expenses 108.2 76.2 5.6 3.8 Depreciation and amortization expenses 1.2 13.0 0.1 0.7 General and administrative expenses 10.5 11.5 0.5 0.6 Total operating expenses 1,458.0 1,490.7 75.7 74.8 Income from equity investees 220.2 195.6 11.4 9.8 Operating income $ 687.2 $ 697.5 35.7 % 35.0 % Revenues Channel Development total net revenues for fiscal 2020 decreased $68 million, or 3% compared to fiscal 2019, primarily due to the lapping of higher transition activities related to the Global Coffee Alliance ($115 million) and product sales to Unilever as a result of the sale and transition of the Tazo brand ($34 million). These were partially offset by the expansion of the Global Coffee A lliance ($70 million), as at-home coffee consumption grew while the Foodservice business experienced softening due to COVID-19. Operating Margin Channel Development operating income for fiscal 2020 decreased 1% to $687 million, compared to $698 million in fiscal 2019. Operating margin increased 70 basis points to 35.7%, primarily due to the transfer of certain single-serve products to Nestlé as part of the Global Coffee Alliance (approximately 150 basis points), strong performance from our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture (approximately 80 basis points) and lapping the correction of amortization expense (approximately 60 basis points) in the prior year, partially offset by certain transition items related to the Global Coffee Alliance (approximately 190 basis points). 31 Table of Contents Corporate and Other Fiscal Year Ended Sep 27, 2020 Sep 29, 2019 % Change Net revenues: Other $ 66.2 $ 66.3 (0.2) % Total net revenues 66.2 66.3 (0.2) Product and distribution costs 63.3 67.3 (5.9) Store operating expenses — 0.3 nm Other operating expenses 14.0 18.6 (24.7) Depreciation and amortization expenses 149.7 156.7 (4.5) General and administrative expenses 1,121.7 1,170.8 (4.2) Restructuring and impairments 22.3 19.7 13.2 Total operating expenses 1,371.0 1,433.4 (4.4) Operating loss $ (1,304.8) $ (1,367.1) (4.6) % Corporate and Other primarily consists of our unallocated corporate expenses and Evolution Fresh. Unallocated corporate expenses include corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments. Corporate and Other operating loss decreased to $1.3 billion for fiscal 2020, or 5%, compared to $1.4 billion in fiscal 2019. This decrease was primarily driven by lower performance-based compensation and lapping of the 2018 U.S stock award granted in fiscal 2018, which was funded by savings from the Tax Act and vested in fiscal 2019, partially offset by incremental strategic investments in technology. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2018 Consolidated results of operations (in millions) : Revenues Fiscal Year Ended Sep 29, 2019 Sep 30, 2018 % Change Net revenues: Company-operated stores $ 21,544.4 $ 19,690.3 9.4 % Licensed stores 2,875.0 2,652.2 8.4 Other 2,089.2 2,377.0 (12.1) Total net revenues $ 26,508.6 $ 24,719.5 7.2 % Total net revenues increased $1.8 billion, or 7%, over fiscal 2018, primarily driven by higher revenues from company-operated stores ($1.9 billion). The growth in company-operated store revenues was driven by incremental revenues from 947 net new Starbucks ® company-operated store openings over the past 12 months ($957 million) and a 5% increase in comparable store sales ($879 million), attributable to a 3% increase in average ticket and a 2% increase in comparable transactions. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation ($189 million) and the conversion of our Thailand, France and the Netherlands retail businesses to fully licensed markets during fiscal 2019 ($161 million). Licensed store revenue growth also contributed to the increase in total net revenues ($223 million), primarily due to higher product and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($228 million), largely due to the opening of 992 net new Starbucks ® licensed stores over the past 12 months, and the conversion of our Thailand, France and the Netherlands retail businesses to fully licensed markets ($35 million), partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation ($41 million). Other revenues decreased $288 million, primarily driven by the licensing of our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestlé. Partially offsetting this decrease was growth in product revenue, primarily premium single-serve products, in connection with the Global Coffee Alliance. 32 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Fiscal Year Ended Sep 29, 2019 Sep 30, 2018 Sep 29, 2019 Sep 30, 2018 As a % of Total Net Revenues Product and distribution costs $ 8,526.9 $ 7,930.7 32.2 % 32.1 % Store operating expenses 10,493.6 9,472.2 39.6 38.3 Other operating expenses 371.0 554.9 1.4 2.2 Depreciation and amortization expenses 1,377.3 1,247.0 5.2 5.0 General and administrative expenses 1,824.1 1,708.2 6.9 6.9 Restructuring and impairments 135.8 224.4 0.5 0.9 Total operating expenses 22,728.7 21,137.4 85.7 85.5 Income from equity investees 298.0 301.2 1.1 1.2 Operating income $ 4,077.9 $ 3,883.3 15.4 % 15.7 % Store operating expenses as a % of related revenues 48.7 % 48.1 % Product and distribution costs as a percentage of total net revenues increased 10 basis points, primarily due to licensing our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestlé (approximately 80 basis points), partially offset by cost savings initiatives (approximately 70 basis points) and leverage on product and distribution costs, largely driven by price increases. Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 130 basis points. Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues increased 60 basis points, primarily driven by investments in our store partners that are funded by savings from the Tax Act and growth in wages and benefits (approximately 120 basis points), largely in the Americas segment, partially offset by sales leverage driven by price increases and the impact of the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance on stored value card breakage. Other operating expenses decreased $184 million, primarily due to cost savings related to licensing our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestlé ($176 million) and lapping prior year costs associated with the establishment of the Global Coffee Alliance ($34 million), including business taxes associated with the up-front prepaid royalty from Nestlé and headcount-related costs, primarily relating to employee bonus and retention costs. Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 20 basis points, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in East China (approximately 20 basis points). General and administrative expenses increased $116 million, primarily driven by higher performance-based compensation ($89 million) and the 2019 Starbucks Leadership Experience in Chicago, heavily concentrated in our fiscal fourth quarter ($52 million). Restructuring and impairment expenses decreased $89 million, primarily due to lower restructuring and impairment costs related to Teavana TM/MC retail store closures ($128 million) and lower impairments related to our Switzerland retail market ($27 million), partially offset by higher exit costs associated with the closure of certain Starbucks ® company-operated stores ($32 million) and severance costs ($25 million). Income from equity investees decreased $3 million, primarily due to the impact of our ownership changes in East China. This decrease was partially offset by improved comparable store sales from our joint venture in South Korea and higher income from our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture. The combination of these changes resulted in an overall decrease in operating margin of 30 basis points in fiscal 2019 when compared to fiscal 2018. 33 Table of Contents Other Income and Expenses Fiscal Year Ended Sep 29, 2019 Sep 30, 2018 Sep 29, 2019 Sep 30, 2018 As a % of Total Net Revenues Operating income $ 4,077.9 $ 3,883.3 15.4 % 15.7 % Gain resulting from acquisition of joint venture — 1,376.4 — 5.6 Net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations 622.8 499.2 2.3 2.0 Interest income and other, net 96.5 191.4 0.4 0.8 Interest expense (331.0) (170.3) (1.2) (0.7) Earnings before income taxes 4,466.2 5,780.0 16.8 23.4 Income tax expense 871.6 1,262.0 3.3 5.1 Net earnings including noncontrolling interests 3,594.6 4,518.0 13.6 18.3 Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (4.6) (0.3) — — Net earnings attributable to Starbucks $ 3,599.2 $ 4,518.3 13.6 % 18.3 % Effective tax rate including noncontrolling interests 19.5 % 21.8 % Gain resulting from acquisition of joint venture in fiscal 2018 was due to remeasuring our preexisting 50% ownership interest in our East China joint venture to fair value upon acquisition. Net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations was primarily due to the sale of our Thailand, France and the Netherlands retail operations in fiscal 2019. The gain in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the sale of our Tazo brand and Taiwan joint venture, partially offset by the net loss from the sale of our Brazil retail operations in fiscal 2018. Interest income and other, net decreased $95 million, primarily due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance on a prospective basis, which required estimated breakage on unredeemed store value cards to be recorded as revenue. We recorded stored value card breakage in interest income and other, net in the prior year. Interest expense increased $161 million primarily due to additional interest incurred on long-term debt issued in November 2017, March 2018, August 2018 and May 2019. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 19.5% compared to 21.8% for fiscal 2018. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the lower corporate tax rate as a result of the Tax Act (approximately 350 basis points), lapping prior year's transition tax on our accumulated undistributed foreign earnings and remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities (approximately 300 basis points), higher stock-based compensation excess tax benefit (approximately 140 basis points), the release of income tax reserves related to the settlement of a U.S. tax examination and the expiration of statute of limitations (approximately 130 basis points) and the tax impacts of the gain on the sale of our Thailand retail operations (approximately 130 basis points). These favorable impacts were partially offset by the lapping of prior year's gain on the purchase of our East China joint venture that was not subject to income tax (approximately 580 basis points) and the impact of changes in indefinite reinvestment assertions for certain foreign subsidiaries during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 (approximately 170 basis points).

Also contributing were higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($144 million), primarily resulting from comparable store sales growth and the opening of 323 net new Starbucks ® licensed stores, or 4% increase, over the past 12 months and the impact of the adoption of revenue recognition guidance on stored value card breakage ($119 million). Operating Margin Americas operating income for fiscal 2019 increased 9% to $3.8 billion, compared to $3.5 billion in fiscal 2018. Operating margin decreased 10 basis points to 20.7%, primarily driven by higher partner investments, largely funded by savings from the Tax Act, growth in wages and benefits (approximately 130 basis points) and to a much lesser extent, investments in labor hours heavily concentrated in our fiscal fourth quarter. Partially offsetting these were cost savings initiatives, primarily in product and distribution costs (approximately 90 basis points), the impact of the adoption of revenue recognition guidance on stored value card breakage (approximately 50 basis points) and sales leverage. 35 Table of Contents International Fiscal Year Ended Sep 29, 2019 Sep 30, 2018 Sep 29, 2019 Sep 30, 2018 As a % of International Total Net Revenues Net revenues: Company-operated stores $ 5,256.2 $ 4,702.1 84.9 % 84.7 % Licensed stores 917.0 837.0 14.8 15.1 Other 17.5 12.1 0.3 0.2 Total net revenues 6,190.7 5,551.2 100.0 100.0 Product and distribution costs 1,894.9 1,709.4 30.6 30.8 Store operating expenses 2,428.5 2,182.3 39.2 39.3 Other operating expenses 116.4 98.9 1.9 1.8 Depreciation and amortization expenses 511.5 447.6 8.3 8.1 General and administrative expenses 317.9 302.5 5.1 5.4 Restructuring and impairments 59.2 55.1 1.0 1.0 Total operating expenses 5,328.4 4,795.8 86.1 86.4 Income from equity investees 102.4 117.4 1.7 2.1 Operating income $ 964.7 $ 872.8 15.6 % 15.7 % Discussion of our International segment results below reflects the impact of fully consolidating our East China business from an equity method joint venture to a company-operated market since the acquisition date of December 31, 2017. Under the joint venture model, we recognized royalties and product sales within revenue and related product and distribution costs as well as our proportionate share of East China's net earnings, which resulted in a higher margin business. Under the company-operated ownership model, East China’s operating results are reflected in most income statement lines of this segment. Revenues International total net revenues for fiscal 2019 increased $640 million, or 12%%, primarily driven by 665 net new Starbucks ® company-operated stores, or a 12% increase, over the past 12 months ($377 million), the ownership change in East China ($280 million) and a 3% increase in comparable store sales ($135 million). Also contributing were increased product sales to and royalty revenues from licensees ($84 million), primarily resulting from opening of 669 net new Starbucks ® licensed stores, or an 11% increase, over the past 12 months and the impact of the adoption of revenue recognition guidance on stored value card breakage ($20 million). These increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation ($183 million) and the conversion of our Thailand, France and the Netherlands retail businesses to fully licensed markets ($126 million). Operating Margin International operating income for fiscal 2019 increased 11% to $965 million, compared to $873 million in fiscal 2018. Operating margin decreased 10 basis points to 15.6%, primarily driven by strategic investments to support growth in China (approximately 80 basis points) and growth in wages and benefits (approximately 70 basis points), primarily offset by cost savings initiatives (approximately 80 basis points) and labor efficiencies (approximately 70 basis points). 36 Table of Contents Channel Development Fiscal Year Ended Sep 29, 2019 Sep 30, 2018 Sep 29, 2019 Sep 30, 2018 As a % of Channel Development Total Net Revenues Total net revenues $ 1,992.6 $ 2,297.3 Product and distribution costs 1,390.0 1,252.3 69.8 54.5 Other operating expenses 76.2 286.5 3.8 12.5 Depreciation and amortization expenses 13.0 1.3 0.7 0.1 General and administrative expenses 11.5 13.9 0.6 0.6 Total operating expenses 1,490.7 1,554.0 74.8 67.6 Income from equity investees 195.6 183.8 9.8 8.0 Operating income $ 697.5 $ 927.1 35.0 % 40.4 % Our Channel Development segment results reflect the impact of the licensing of our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestlé late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, which we lapped late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Our collaborative business relationships for our global ready-to-drink products and the associated revenues remain unchanged due to the Global Coffee Alliance. Revenues Channel Development net revenues for fiscal 2019 decreased $305 million, or 13%, when compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by licensing our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestlé ($329 million), offset by growth in product revenue, primarily premium single-serve products, in connection with our Global Coffee Alliance ($25 million).

Operating margin decreased 540 basis points to 35.0%, primarily driven by licensing our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestlé (approximately 640 basis points), partially offset by lapping prior year costs associated with the establishment of the Global Coffee Alliance (approximately 140 basis points), including business taxes associated with the up-front prepaid royalty and headcount-related costs, primarily related to employee bonus and retention costs. 37 Table of Contents Corporate and Other Fiscal Year Ended Sep 29, 2019 Sep 30, 2018 % Change Net revenues: Company-operated stores $ — $ 66.7 (100.0) % Licensed stores — 1.2 (100.0) Other 66.3 54.5 21.7 Total net revenues 66.3 122.4 (45.8) Product and distribution costs 67.3 84.9 (20.7) Store operating expenses 0.3 41.3 (99.3) Other operating expenses 18.6 18.3 1.6 Depreciation and amortization expenses 156.7 157.1 (0.3) General and administrative expenses 1,170.8 1,086.7 7.7 Restructuring and impairments 19.7 135.9 (85.5) Total operating expenses 1,433.4 1,524.2 (6.0) Operating loss $ (1,367.1) $ (1,401.8) (2.5) % Corporate and Other primarily consists of our unallocated corporate expenses, as well as Evolution Fresh and the legacy operations of the Teavana retail business, which substantially ceased during fiscal 2018. Unallocated corporate expenses include corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash and Investment Overview Our cash and investments were $4.8 billion and $3.0 billion as of September 27, 2020 and September 29, 2019, respectively. In fiscal 2020, cash and investments increased by $1.8 billion primarily due to the issuance of short-term and long-term debt as well as lower share repurchases following the temporary suspension of our share repurchase program in March 2020. These liquidity increases offset lower retail cash inflows due to temporary store closures and modified operations resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. We actively manage our cash and investments in order to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, make acquisitions and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases. Our investment portfolio primarily includes highly liquid available-for-sale securities, including corporate debt securities, government treasury securities (domestic and foreign) and commercial paper. As of September 27, 2020, approximately $2.0 billion of cash was held in foreign subsidiaries. Borrowing capacity Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Our total contractual borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes was $2.7 billion as of the end of fiscal 2020 when combining the unused commercial paper program and credit facilities discussed below, less outstanding borrowing. Revolving Lines of Credit Our $2.0 billion unsecured 5-year revolving credit facility (“the 2018 credit facility”), of which $150 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit, is currently set to mature on October 25, 2022. We have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $500 million. Borrowings under the credit facility are subject to terms defined within the 2018 credit facility and will bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR, and, for U.S. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate, in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on the better of (i) the Company's long-term credit ratings assigned by Moody's and Standard & Poor's rating agencies and (ii) the Company's fixed charge coverage ratio, pursuant to a pricing grid set forth in the five-year credit agreement. The current applicable margin is 1.100% for Eurocurrency Rate Loans and 0.000% (nil) for Base Rate Loans. The 2018 credit facility is available for general corporate purposes. As of September 27, 2020, we had no borrowings under the 2018 credit facility. Our $1.0 billion unsecured 364-day credit facility (the “364-day credit facility”), of which no amount may be used for issuances of letters of credit, is currently set to mature on September 22, 2021. We have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $500 million. Borrowings under the credit facility are subject to terms defined within the 364-day credit facility and will bear interest at a variable rate based on 38 Table of Contents LIBOR, and, for U.S. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate, in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on the better of (i) the Company's long-term credit ratings assigned by Moody's and Standard & Poor's rating agencies and (ii) the Company's fixed charge coverage ratio, pursuant to a pricing grid set forth in the 364-day credit agreement. The applicable margin is 1.150% for Eurocurrency Rate Loans and 0.150% for Base Rate Loans. The 364-day credit facility is available for general corporate purposes. As of September 27, 2020, we had no borrowings under the 364-day credit facility. Due to the financial impacts from COVID-19, we reached an agreement with our lenders to amend the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant for our combined $3.0 billion revolving lines of credit, through the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021. Commercial Paper Under our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion, with individual maturities that may vary but not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. Amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program are required to be backstopped by available commitments under the 2018 and 364-day credit facilities discussed above. The proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper program may be used for working capital needs, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, business expansion, payment of cash dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. As of September 27, 2020, we had borrowings of $296.5 million outstanding, net of unamortized discount, under our commercial paper program, of which a majority will mature during the second quarter of fiscal 2021. Credit Facilities in Japan Additionally, we hold Japanese yen-denominated credit facilities which are available for working capital needs and capital expenditures within our Japanese market. During the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we expanded our ¥1 billion unsecured credit facility to ¥5 billion, or $47.4 million, as of September 27, 2020. This facility is currently set to mature on December 31, 2020. Borrowings under the credit facility are subject to terms defined within the facility and will bear interest at a variable rate based on TIBOR plus an applicable margin of 0.400%. Additionally during the third quarter, we expanded our ¥2 billion unsecured credit facility to ¥10 billion, or $94.9 million, as of September 27, 2020. This facility is currently set to mature on March 26, 2021. Borrowings under the credit facility are subject to terms defined within the facility and will bear interest at a variable rate based on TIBOR plus 0.300%. As of September 27, 2020, we had $142.3 million of borrowings outstanding under these credit facilities. In October 2020, we entered into a new ¥10 billion unsecured facility, or approximately $95 million as of October 29, 2020. This facility is set to mature on October 29, 2021. Borrowings under the credit facility are subject to terms defined within the facility and will bear interest at a variable rate based on TIBOR plus an applicable margin of 0.350%. Long-Term Debt On May 7, 2020, we issued long-term debt in an underwritten registered public offering, which consisted of $500 million of 1.300% Senior Notes (the“2022 notes”) due May 2022, $1.25 billion of 2.550% Senior Notes (the “2030 notes”) due November 2030 and $1.25 billion of 3.500% Senior Notes (the “2050 notes”) due November 2050. We are using the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes and for future repayments of outstanding indebtedness. Interest on the 2022 notes is payable semi-annually on May 7 and November 7, commencing on November 7, 2020. Interest on the 2030 notes and the 2050 notes is payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15, commencing on November 15, 2020. On March 12, 2020, we issued long-term debt in an underwritten registered public offering, which consisted of $500 million of 2.000% Senior Notes (the “2027 notes”) due March 2027, $750 million of 2.250% Senior Notes (the “2030 notes”) due March 2030 and $500 million of 3.350% Senior Notes (the “2050 notes”) due March 2050. We are using the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of outstanding borrowings under our commercial paper program. We may temporarily invest funds that are not immediately needed for these purposes in short-term investments, including marketable securities. Interest on the 2027 notes, the 2030 notes and the 2050 notes is payable semi-annually on March 12 and September 12, commencing on September 12, 2020. See Note 9 , Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for details of the components of our long-term debt. Our ability to incur new liens and conduct sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties is subject to compliance with terms of the indentures under which the Senior Notes were issued. As of September 27, 2020, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. Use of Cash We expect to use our available cash and investments, including, but not limited to, additional potential future borrowings under the credit facilities, commercial paper program and the issuance of debt to support and invest in our core businesses, including 39 Table of Contents investing in new ways to serve our customers and supporting our store partners, repaying maturing debts, as well as returning cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and discretionary share repurchases and investing in new business opportunities related to our core and developing businesses. Further, we may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our investees. We may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business in support of our “Growth at Scale” agenda. Acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our investees. Any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy. We believe that net future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and investments both domestically and internationally combined with our ability to leverage our balance sheet through the issuance of debt will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses as well as shareholder distributions for the foreseeable future. Significant new joint ventures, acquisitions and/or other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding. We have borrowed funds and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates; however, additional borrowings would result in increased interest expense in the future. In this regard, we may incur additional debt, within targeted levels, as part of our plans to fund our capital programs, including cash returns to shareholders through future dividends and discretionary share repurchases. To further strengthen our liquidity in the near term, we currently expect the suspension of share repurchases to continue through the end of fiscal 2021. If necessary, we may pursue additional sources of financing, including both short-term and long-term borrowings and debt issuances. We regularly review our cash positions and our determination of indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings. In the event we determine that all or a portion of such foreign earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested, we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes, which could be material. We do not anticipate the need for repatriated funds to the U.S. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs. See Note 14 , Income Taxes, for further discussion. During fiscal 2020, we entered into a new $500 million unsecured 364-day term-loan facility (“the 2020 term-loan facility”) which we drew on and subsequently repaid within the fiscal year. The 2020 term-loan facility was originally set to mature on March 19, 2021. During each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2019, we declared a cash dividend to shareholders of $0.36 per share. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 and each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2020, we declared a cash dividend of $0.41 per share. Dividends are paid in the quarter following the declaration date. Cash returned to shareholders through dividends in fiscal 2020 and 2019 totaled $1.9 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. Subsequent to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we declared a cash dividend of $0.45 per share to be paid on November 27, 2020 with an expected payout of approximately $527.9 million. As of the date of this report, we do not expect to reduce our quarterly dividend as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. In September 2018, we entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements (“ASR agreements”) with third-party financial institutions totaling $5.0 billion, effective October 1, 2018. We made a $5.0 billion up-front payment to the financial institutions and received an initial delivery of 72.0 million shares of our common stock. In March 2019, we received an additional 4.9 million shares upon the completion of the program based on a volume-weighted average share price (less discount) of $65.03. Additionally, in March 2019, we entered into ASR agreements with third-party financial institutions totaling $2.0 billion, effective March 22, 2019. We made a $2.0 billion up-front payment to the financial institutions and received an initial delivery of 22.2 million shares of our common stock. In June 2019, we received an additional 3.9 million shares upon the completion of the program based on a volume-weighted average share price (less discount) of $76.50. Outside of the ASR agreements noted above, we repurchased 36.6 million shares of common stock for $3.1 billion on the open market during the fiscal year ended September 29, 2019. In total, we repurchased 139.6 million shares at a total cost of $10.1 billion for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2019. Our Board of Directors approved an increase of 120 million and 40 million shares to our ongoing share repurchase program during the fiscal first quarter of 2019 and fiscal second quarter of 2020, respectively. We temporarily suspended our share repurchase program in March 2020. Prior to the suspension, we repurchased 20.3 million shares of common stock for $1.7 billion on the open market during the year ended September 27, 2020. As of September 27, 2020, 48.9 million shares remained available for repurchase under current authorizations. The existing share repurchase program remains authorized by the Board of Directors. The suspension of the share repurchases is currently expected to continue through fiscal 2021, and we may resume share repurchases in the future at any time, depending upon operating results, our capital needs and other factors. Other than normal operating expenses, cash requirements for fiscal 2021 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for investments in our new and existing stores and our supply chain and corporate facilities. Total capital expenditures for fiscal 2021 are expected to be approximately $1.9 billion. 40 Table of Contents Cash Flows Cash provided by operating activities was $1.6 billion for fiscal 2020, compared to $5.0 billion for fiscal 2019. The change was primarily due to temporary retail store closures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. federal tax payment related to the Nestlé transaction and the timing of other tax payments and refunds. Cash used in investing activities totaled $1.7 billion for fiscal 2020, compared to $1.0 billion for fiscal 2019. The change was primarily driven by lapping proceeds from the divestiture of certain operations related to the conversions of our retail businesses in Thailand, France and the Netherlands to fully licensed markets during 2019 and an increase in purchase of investments in fiscal 2020. This was partially offset by lower capital expenditures for new and existing stores. Cash provided by financing activities for fiscal 2020 totaled $1.7 billion, compared to cash used in financing activities of $10.1 billion for fiscal 2019. The change was primarily due to higher repurchases of our common stock under accelerated share repurchase agreements in fiscal 2019 and higher proceeds from issuance of long-term debt in fiscal 2020. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and borrowings as of September 27, 2020, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods ( in millions ): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations (1) Total Less than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years More than 5 Years Operating lease obligations (2) $ 10,089.6 $ 1,528.1 $ 2,668.7 $ 2,112.6 $ 3,780.2 Debt obligations Principal payments 16,445.2 1,688.8 2,000.0 2,806.4 9,950.0 Interest payments 7,140.5 501.2 893.4 793.5 4,952.4 Purchase obligations (3) 1,237.1 750.3 423.4 63.4 — Other obligations (4) 498.9 101.0 71.5 115.9 210.5 Total $ 35,411.3 $ 4,569.4 $ 6,057.0 $ 5,891.8 $ 18,893.1 (1) We have excluded long-term gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties of $137.5 million from the amounts presented as the timing of these obligations is uncertain. (2) Amounts include direct lease obligations, excluding any taxes, insurance and other related expenses. (3) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on Starbucks and that specify all significant terms. Green coffee purchase commitments comprise 93% of total purchase obligations. (4) Other obligations include other long-term liabilities primarily consisting of the Tax Act transition tax, asset retirement obligations, Valor Siren Ventures I L.P. (VSV) investment and hedging instruments. Starbucks currently expects to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Off-balance sheet arrangements relate to purchase commitments detailed in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. COMMODITY PRICES, AVAILABILITY AND GENERAL RISK CONDITIONS Commodity price risk represents Starbucks primary market risk, generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products, among other items. We purchase, roast and sell high-quality arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. In addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our company-operated stores. The price and availability of these commodities directly impacts our results of operations, and we expect commodity prices, particularly coffee, to impact future results of operations. For additional details see Product Supply in Item 1 , as well as Risk Factors in Item 1A of this 10-K. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT Market risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity security prices and interest rates. We manage our exposure to various market-based risks according to a market price risk management policy. Under this policy, market-based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies, such as entering into hedging transactions. The market price risk management policy governs how hedging instruments may be used to mitigate 41 Table of Contents risk. Risk limits are set annually and prohibit speculative trading activity. We also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk, which we consider to be low. We use interest rate swap agreements and treasury locks to primarily hedge against changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances and cross-currency swaps and foreign exchange debt instruments to hedge against changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt and foreign exchange exposure of net investments in Japan. Excluding interest rate hedging instruments, cross currency swaps and foreign currency debt, hedging instruments generally do not have maturities in excess of three years. Refer to Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 3 , Derivative Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion of our hedging instruments. The sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited, point-in-time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed. The actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses. Commodity Price Risk We purchase commodity inputs, primarily coffee, dairy products, diesel, cocoa, sugar and other commodities, that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results. We use a combination of pricing features embedded within supply contracts, such as fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed contracts for coffee purchases, and financial derivatives to manage our commodity price risk exposure. The following table summarizes the potential impact as of September 27, 2020 to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income (“OCI”) from changes in commodity prices. The information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items (in millions) : Increase/(Decrease) to Net Earnings Increase/(Decrease) to OCI 10% Increase in Underlying Rate 10% Decrease in Underlying Rate 10% Increase in Underlying Rate 10% Decrease in Underlying Rate Commodity hedges $ 1 $ (1) $ 13 $ (13) Foreign Currency Exchange Risk The majority of our revenue, expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the U.S., we have transactions in other currencies, primarily the Chinese renminbi, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, British pound, South Korean won and euro. To reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations, we enter into derivative instruments to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated intercompany royalty payments, inventory purchases, intercompany borrowing and lending activities and certain other transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity that enters into the arrangements, as well as the translation risk of certain balance sheet items. The volatility in the foreign exchange market may lead to significant fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates and adversely impact our financial results in the case of weakening foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. See Note 3 , Derivative Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion. The following table summarizes the potential impact as of September 27, 2020 to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due to a change in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign exchange rates. The information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items ( in millions ): Increase/(Decrease) to Net Earnings Increase/(Decrease) to OCI 10% Increase in Underlying Rate 10% Decrease in Underlying Rate 10% Increase in Underlying Rate 10% Decrease in Underlying Rate Foreign currency hedges $ 37 $ (37) $ 164 $ (164) Equity Security Price Risk We have minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds and equity exchange-traded funds within our marketable equity securities portfolio. Marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value and approximates a portion of our liability under our Management Deferred Compensation Plan (“MDCP”). Gains and losses from the portfolio and the change in our MDCP liability are recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings. We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of September 27, 2020 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments. 42 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk Long-term Debt We utilize short-term and long-term financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage our overall interest expense related to our existing fixed-rate debt, as well as to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances. See Note 3 , Derivative Financial Instruments and Note 9 , Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion of our interest rate hedge agreements and details of the components of our long-term debt, respectively, as of September 27, 2020. The following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates as of September 27, 2020 on the fair value of Starbucks debt (in millions) : Change in Fair Value Fair Value 100 Basis Point Increase in Underlying Rate 100 Basis Point Decrease in Underlying Rate Long-term debt (1) $ 17,500 $ 1,294 $ (1,294) (1) Amount disclosed is net of $23 million change in the fair value of our designated interest rate swap. Refer to Note 3 , Derivative Financial Instruments, for additional information on our interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge. Available-for-Sale Debt Securities Our available-for-sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of investment-grade debt securities. The primary objective of these investments is to preserve capital and liquidity. Available-for-sale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. We do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our investments. We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our available-for-sale securities as of September 27, 2020 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain, especially in light of the current economic environment due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity. We consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. During the past five fiscal years, we have not made any material changes to the accounting methodologies used to assess the areas discussed below, unless noted otherwise. 43 Table of Contents Property, Plant and Equipment and Other Finite-Lived Assets We evaluate property, plant and equipment, operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and other finite-lived assets for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. When evaluating for impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis and is depreciated over the asset's remaining useful life. Long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For company-operated store assets, the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level, which is inclusive of property, plant and equipment and lease ROU assets. The fair value of a store’s assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. For other long-lived assets, fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances, which may include discounted cash flows, comparable transactions, or comparable company analyses. Our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values. Key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values include projected revenue growth and operating expenses, as well as forecasting asset useful lives and selecting an appropriate discount rate. For company-operated stores, estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider the store’s historical performance, the local market economics and the business environment impacting the store’s performance. The discount rate is selected based on what we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store. These estimates are subjective and our ability to realize future cash flows and asset fair values is affected by factors such as ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets, changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance. In each of the three fiscal years prior to fiscal 2020, our business has operated at levels of growth and profitability that have not required material numbers of our store assets to be reviewed for potential impairment. Given the substantial reduction in our revenues and cash flows as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, primarily in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, along with our announced restructuring plans to close up to 800 of our company-operated stores in the U.S. and Canada in the next 18 months, we identified triggering events that required us to assess the need for potential impairment charges for a larger number of company-operated stores in fiscal 2020 than in prior years. As a result of these activities, we recorded store impairment charges of $298.9 million in fiscal 2020, of which $239.3 million was included in restructuring and impairment expenses on our consolidated statement of earnings. The magnitude of these charges was not particularly sensitive to variations in fair value inputs, as the majority of charges recorded were the result of full impairments of stores identified for closure, based on factors such as the format and location of the store or its current operating performance. Excluding stores in areas impacted by our restructuring plans, our company-operated store portfolio is projecting a return to pre-COVID-19 levels of operations and cash flow recoverability within the next 12 months. However, irrespective of the above, our expectations of business recovery trends may vary materially in future periods based on the pace of global and market-specific recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. As of September 27, 2020, we had identified 405 stores in the U.S. and Canada for closure under our restructuring plans. We expect to potentially identify up to another 395 stores for closure. We expect total future restructuring costs, which are attributable to our Americas segment, to range from approximately $260 million to $400 million. These restructuring costs include accelerated amortization or impairments of ROU assets due to planned store closures prior to the end of contractual lease terms ($150 million to $190 million), store asset impairment and disposal costs not previously recorded as part of our ongoing store impairment process ($100 million to $190 million) and the remaining amount relates to employee termination costs. Our estimates of future restructuring costs are based on actual costs incurred for recently closed stores of similar profile under the restructuring plans. As we have previously recorded impairment charges in fiscal 2020 for stores that may be identified for closure under our plans, and because store closure decisions are still subject to change, the final costs associated with these store closures may be different from the initial estimates. These costs will depend on the asset carrying value and remaining lease term for each store identified. Future restructuring costs are expected to be incurred over the next 18 months as stores are specifically identified for closure or, in the case of lease exit costs, when the stores cease operations. Asset impairment charges are discussed in Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets We evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate impairment may exist. When evaluating these assets for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair 44 Table of Contents value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit using discounted cash flows or a combination of discounted cash flow and market approaches. When assessing goodwill for impairment, our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment for an individual reporting unit in a given year is influenced by a number of factors, inclusive of the carrying value of the reporting unit's goodwill, the significance of the excess of the reporting unit's estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date, the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments and the date of acquisition. If we perform a quantitative assessment of an individual reporting unit’s goodwill, our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment when estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, including projected revenue growth and operating expenses related to existing businesses, product innovation and new store concepts, as well as utilizing valuation multiples of similar publicly traded companies and selecting an appropriate discount rate. Estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering the reporting unit’s past performance and forecasted growth, including assumptions regarding business recovery post COVID-19, strategic initiatives, local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit’s performance. The discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital for a market participant to operate the reporting unit in the region. These estimates, as well as the selection of comparable companies and valuation multiples used in the market approaches are highly subjective, and our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion. Our goodwill impairment assessments were not significantly altered as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to believe the fair value of each of our reporting units is significantly in excess of its carrying value, and absent a sustained multi-year global decline in our business in key markets such as the U.S. and China, we do not anticipate incurring significant goodwill impairment in the next 12 months. When assessing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, where we perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate if changes in events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that impairment may exist. If we do not perform a qualitative impairment assessment or if changes in events and circumstances indicate that a quantitative assessment should be performed, management is required to calculate the fair value of the intangible asset group. The fair value calculation includes estimates of revenue growth, which are based on past performance and internal projections for the intangible asset group's forecasted growth, including assumptions regarding business recovery post COVID-19, and royalty rates, which are adjusted for our particular facts and circumstances. The discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital that reflects the risk profile of the related business. These estimates are highly subjective, and our ability to achieve the forecasted cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion. During fiscal 2020, we recorded a charge of $22.1 million relating to the impairment of an indefinite-lived intangible asset due to changes in branding and marketing strategy. The amount of charge taken was not materially impacted by our choice of fair value assumptions, and we do not anticipate recording significant impairment charges in the next 12 months. Definite-lived intangible asset impairment charges are discussed in Note 8 , Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. Income Taxes We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. We routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and results of operations. In projecting future taxable income, we consider historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. Our assumptions regarding future taxable income are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income/(loss). During fiscal 2020, we recorded valuation allowances of $56.5 million to reduce our deferred tax asset balance as of the beginning of the fiscal year relating to certain foreign jurisdictions not expected to generate enough future income to offset accumulated losses. Absent a sustained multi-year global decline in our business in key markets such as the U.S., China and Japan, we do not anticipate incurring significant additional valuation allowances against our remaining deferred tax assets as of September 27, 2020 in the next 12 months. In addition, our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include review of our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions. We evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit only if it is 45 Table of Contents more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of our position. For uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold, we record a related liability. We adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available. As discussed in Note 1 4 , Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, there is a reasonable possibility that our unrecognized tax benefit liability will be adjusted within 12 months due to the expiration of a statute of limitations and/or resolution of examinations with taxing authorities. We have generated income in certain foreign jurisdictions that may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes. We regularly review our plans for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings. These plans have been unaltered as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. While we do not expect to repatriate cash to the U.S. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs, if these amounts were distributed to the U.S., in the form of dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes, which could be material. Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. Deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation, the status of various income tax audits and our particular facts and circumstances. Although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results, including forecasted COVID-19 business recovery, could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected.

Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business We purchase and roast high-quality coffees that we sell, along with handcrafted coffee and tea beverages and a variety of fresh and prepared food items, through our company-operated stores. We also sell a variety of coffee and tea products and license our trademarks through other channels such as licensed stores, grocery and foodservice. The grocery and foodservice business is primarily through our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestlé established in August 2018. In this 10-K, Starbucks Corporation (together with its subsidiaries) is referred to as “Starbucks,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our.” Certain prior period information on the consolidated statements of cash flows has been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. In the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we renamed the “cost of sales” caption on our consolidated statement of earnings to “product and distribution costs,” which more accurately reflects the substance of costs classified within this line item. There were no classification or other changes made in conjunction with the new caption. We have three reportable operating segments: 1) Americas, which is inclusive of the U.S., Canada and Latin America; 2) International, which is inclusive of China/Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East and Africa; and 3) Channel Development. Non-reportable operating segments such as Evolution Fresh and unallocated corporate expenses are reported within Corporate and Other. Principles of Consolidation Our consolidated financial statements reflect the financial position and operating results of Starbucks, including wholly-owned subsidiaries and investees that we control. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Fiscal Year End Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. Fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 included 52 weeks. Estimates and Assumptions Preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Examples include, but are not limited to, estimates for inventory reserves, asset and goodwill impairments, assumptions underlying self-insurance reserves, income from unredeemed stored value cards, stock-based compensation forfeiture rates, future asset retirement obligations and the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements. Actual results and outcomes may differ from these estimates and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties, including uncertainty in the current economic environment due to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”). Restructuring In the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we announced a plan to optimize our North America store portfolio, primarily in dense metropolitan markets by blending store formats to better cater to changing customer tastes and preferences. As of September 27, 2020, we expect the total number of closures to be approximately 800 stores in the U.S. and Canada, reflecting an additional 200 store closures than the initial estimate of 600 stores. As of September 27, 2020, we identified 405 stores for closure under our restructuring plans, and as a result we recorded approximately $ 254.7 million to restructuring and impairments on our consolidated statement of earnings. Of this total, $ 151.6 million related to the impairment of store assets for which either a triggering event occurred and the assets were determined not to be recoverable or the store was permanently closed. An additional $ 87.7 million was primarily associated with accelerated amortization or impairments of right-of-use (“ROU”) lease assets due to planned store closures prior to the end of contractual lease terms. For impaired store asset groups, we estimated the fair values using an income approach incorporating internal projections of revenue growth and operating expenses that are considered Level 3 fair value measurements, as well as applicable discount rates and market lease rates. The application of these projections and fair value measurements did not have a significant impact on our final impairment decisions given that we plan to fully exit the majority of these identified stores in the next 3 to 6 months. The remaining $ 15.4 million related to employee termination costs. We expect total future restructuring costs, which are attributable to our Americas segment, to range from approximately $ 260 million to $ 400 million. These restructuring costs include accelerated amortization or impairments of ROU assets due to 53 Table of Contents planned store closures prior to the end of contractual lease terms ($ 150 million to $ 190 million), store impairment and disposal costs not previously recorded as part of our ongoing store impairment process ($ 100 million to $ 190 million) and the remaining amount relates to employee termination costs. As we have previously recorded impairment charges in fiscal 2020 for stores that may be identified for closure under our plans, and because store closure decisions are still subject to change, the final costs associated with these store closures may be different from the initial estimates. These costs will depend on the asset carrying value and remaining lease term of the specific stores identified. Future restructuring costs are expected to be incurred over the next 18 months as stores are specifically identified for closure or, in the case of lease exit costs, when the stores either cease operations or when a reduced lease term due to early termination is reasonably certain. As of September 27, 2020, restructuring liabilities totaling $ 80.0 million were included in current and non-current operating lease liability for the remaining outstanding rent liabilities due to landlords. The associated expense was recognized in fiscal 2020 for these stores that were either closed or reasonably certain to close in fiscal 2021. Additionally, $ 15.2 million was included in accrued payroll and benefits for employee termination costs on the consolidated balance sheets. Cash payments were immaterial for fiscal 2020. Cash and Cash Equivalents We consider all highly liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase, as well as credit card receivables for sales to customers in our company-operated stores that generally settle within two to five business days, to be cash equivalents. We maintain cash and cash equivalent balances with financial institutions that exceed federally-insured limits. We have not experienced any losses related to these balances, and we believe credit risk to be minimal. Our cash management system provides for the funding of all major bank disbursement accounts on a daily basis as checks are presented for payment. Under this system, outstanding checks are in excess of the cash balances at certain banks, which creates book overdrafts. Book overdrafts are presented as a current liability in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Investments Available-for-sale Debt Securities Our short-term and long-term investments consist primarily of investment-grade debt securities, all of which are classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair value, and unrealized holding gains and losses are recorded, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Available-for-sale securities with remaining maturities of less than one year and those identified by management at the time of purchase to be used to fund operations within one year are classified as short-term. All other available-for-sale securities are classified as long-term. We evaluate our available-for-sale securities for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. Unrealized losses are charged against net earnings when a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary. We review several factors to determine whether a loss is other than temporary, such as the length and extent of the fair value decline, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and whether we have the intent to sell or will more likely than not be required to sell before the securities' anticipated recovery, which may be at maturity. Realized gains and losses are accounted for using the specific identification method. Purchases and sales are recorded on a trade date basis. Marketable Equity Securities We also have a marketable equity securities portfolio, which is comprised of marketable equity mutual funds and equity exchange-traded funds. Marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value and approximates a portion of our liability under our Management Deferred Compensation Plan (“MDCP”). Gains or losses from the portfolio and the change in our MDCP liability are recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings. Equity Investments Equity investments are accounted under the equity method if we are able to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. Our share of the earnings or losses as reported by the investees is classified as income from equity investees on our consolidated statements of earnings. The investments are evaluated for impairment annually and when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. We account for equity investments for which we do not have significant influence and without readily determinable fair values at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments as permitted by the measurement alternative. Investments for which the measurement alternative has been elected are assessed for impairment quarterly, or if a triggering event indicates impairment may be present. Any adjustments as a result of price changes or impairments are recorded in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. 54 Table of Contents Fair Value Fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability (exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants. For assets and liabilities recorded or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis, we determine fair value based on the following: Level 1: The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. For equity and U.S. government treasury securities and commodity futures contracts, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets to determine fair value. Level 2: When quoted prices in active markets for identical assets are not available, we determine the fair value of our available-for-sale securities and our over-the-counter forward contracts, collars and swaps based upon factors such as the quoted market price of similar assets or a discounted cash flow model using readily observable market data, which may include interest rate curves and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities, depending on the nature of the investment. The fair value of our long-term debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates offered to us for debt of the same remaining maturities. Level 3: We determine the fair value of our auction rate securities using an internally-developed valuation model, using inputs that include interest rate curves, credit and liquidity spreads and effective maturity. Assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis may include items such as property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, equity and other investments and other assets. We determine the fair value of these items using Level 3 inputs, as described in the related sections below. Derivative Instruments We manage our exposure to various risks within our consolidated financial statements according to a market price risk management policy. Under this policy, we may engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments to hedge interest rates, commodity prices and foreign currency-denominated revenue streams, inventory purchases, assets and liabilities and investments in certain foreign operations. In order to manage our exposure to these risks, we use various types of derivative instruments including forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, collars and swaps. Forward contracts and commodity futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a predetermined future date and at a predetermined rate or price. A collar is a strategy that uses a combination of a purchased call option and a sold put option with equal premiums to hedge a portion of anticipated cash flows, or to limit possible gains or losses on an underlying asset or liability to a specific range. A swap agreement is a contract between two parties to exchange cash flows based on specified underlying notional amounts, assets and/or indices. We do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes. We record all derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value and typically do not offset derivative assets and liabilities. Excluding interest rate hedging instruments, cross-currency swaps and foreign currency debt hedging instruments, we generally do not enter into derivative instruments with maturities longer than three years. However, we are allowed to net settle transactions with respective counterparties for certain derivative contracts, inclusive of interest rate swaps and foreign currency forwards, with a single, net amount payable by one party to the other. We also enter into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. As of September 27, 2020, cash collateral held under collateral security arrangements was $ 34.9 million and is included in other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. Cash collateral was immaterial as of September 29, 2019. The potential effects of netting arrangements with our derivative contracts, excluding the effects of collateral, would not have had a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets. By using these derivative instruments, we expose ourselves to potential credit risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. We minimize this credit risk by entering into transactions with carefully selected, credit-worthy counterparties and distribute contracts among several financial institutions to reduce the concentration of credit risk. Cash Flow Hedges For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the derivative's gain or loss is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) on our consolidated balance sheets. The gain or loss is subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged exposure affects net earnings, in the same line item as the underlying hedged item on our consolidated statements of earnings. Cash flow hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the inception of each hedge. Cash flows from hedging transactions are classified in the same categories as the cash flows from the respective hedged items. For de-designated cash flow hedges in which the transactions are no longer likely to occur, the related accumulated derivative gains or losses are recognized in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings based on the nature of the underlying transaction. 55 Table of Contents Net Investment Hedges For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a net investment hedge, the derivative's, or qualifying non-derivative instrument’s gain or loss is reported as a component of OCI and recorded in AOCI. The gain or loss will be subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. Fair Value Hedges For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the changes in fair value of the derivative instrument and the offsetting changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item due to changes in the hedged risk are recorded in interest income and other, net or interest expense on our consolidated statements of earnings. Derivatives Not Designated As Hedging Instruments We also enter into certain foreign currency forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, collars and swaps that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. The changes in the fair values of these contracts are immediately recognized in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. Normal Purchase Normal Sale We enter into fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed green coffee purchase commitments, which are described further in Note 5 , Inventories. For both fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed purchase commitments, we expect to take delivery of green coffee and to utilize the coffee in a reasonable period of time in the ordinary course of business. Since these types of purchase commitments qualify for the normal purchase normal sale exemption, they are not recorded as derivative instruments on our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 3 , Derivative Financial Instruments, and Note 5 , Inventories, for further discussion of our derivative instruments and green coffee purchase commitments. Receivables, net of Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Our receivables are mainly comprised of receivables for product and equipment sales to and royalties from our licensees, as well as receivables from our Global Coffee Alliance and other Channel Development customers. Our allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based on historical experience, customer credit risk and application of the specific identification method. During fiscal 2020, we also assessed incremental risks due to COVID-19 on our licensees' financial viability. For the year ended September 27, 2020, we did not observe a significant deterioration of our receivable portfolio that required a significant increase in bad debt expense. To assist our international licensed partners with their efforts to recover from the impact of COVID-19, we provided a short-term payment extension for their outstanding receivables as of the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2020 and offered longer-term payment extensions to help certain licensees dedicate their capital to further develop stores and build the brand as the business recovers. During the third quarter of fiscal 2020, we waived royalty payments from our international licensees and did not recognize royalty revenues associated with these accounts. We do not believe the terms and forms of these financial relief actions changed our revenue recognition policy or had a significant impact on future collectability. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we resumed normal royalty billings and collections. As of September 27, 2020 and September 29, 2019, our allowance for doubtful accounts was $ 27.1 million and $ 6.7 million, respectively. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (primarily moving average cost) or net realizable value. We record inventory reserves for obsolete and slow-moving inventory and for estimated shrinkage between physical inventory counts. Inventory reserves are based on inventory obsolescence trends, historical experience and application of the specific identification method. As of September 27, 2020 and September 29, 2019, inventory reserves were $ 48.4 million and $ 33.7 million , respectively. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes all direct costs necessary to acquire and prepare assets for use, including internal labor and overhead in some cases. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of the assets, generally ranging from 2 to 15 years for equipment and 30 to 40 years for buildings. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the related lease life, generally 10 years. For leases with renewal periods at our option, we generally use the original lease term, excluding renewal option periods, to determine estimated useful lives. If failure to exercise a renewal option imposes an economic penalty to us, we may determine at the inception of the lease that renewal is reasonably assured and include the renewal option period in the determination of the appropriate estimated useful lives. The portion of depreciation expense related to production and distribution facilities is included in product and distribution costs on our consolidated statements of earnings. The costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed when incurred, while expenditures for refurbishments and improvements that significantly add to the productive capacity or extend the useful life of 56 Table of Contents an asset are capitalized. When assets are disposed of, whether through retirement or sale, the net gain or loss is recognized in net earnings. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell. We evaluate property, plant and equipment for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. When evaluating for impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The fair value of the asset is estimated using a discounted cash flow model based on forecasted future revenues and operating costs, using internal projections. Property, plant and equipment assets and ROU assets related to the store lease are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For company-operated store assets, the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level. We recognized net disposition charges of $ 84.9 million, $ 64.6 million and $ 32.8 million in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Additionally, we recognized net impairment charges of $ 210.0 million, $ 43.4 million and $ 42.8 million in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Of the total net impairment charges, $ 134.6 million, $ 7.1 million and $ 37.0 million in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, were restructuring related and recorded in restructuring and impairment expenses. For fiscal 2020, we evaluated initial COVID-19 business recovery trends and their estimated impacts on future revenue growth and profitability for assessing impairment of our company-operated retail store and related operating lease right-of-use assets. As a result, we recorded $ 59.6 million of impairment losses within store operating expenses on our consolidated statement of earnings during the year ended September 27, 2020. Unless it is restructuring related, the nature of the underlying asset that is impaired or disposed of will determine the operating expense line on which the related impact is recorded on our consolidated statements of earnings. Leases The majority of our leases are operating leases for our company-operated retail store locations. We also lease, among other things, roasting, distribution and warehouse facilities and office space for corporate administrative purposes. We categorize leases as either operating or finance leases at the commencement date of the lease. Operating lease agreements may contain tenant improvement allowances, rent holidays, rent escalation clauses and/or contingent rent provisions. We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for together as a single lease component for all underlying classes of assets. We recognize a ROU asset and lease liability for each operating and finance lease with a contractual term greater than 12 months at the time of lease inception. We do not record leases with an initial term of 12 months or less on our consolidated balance sheet but continue to record rent expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Our leases often include options to extend or terminate at our sole discretion, which are included in the determination of lease term when they are reasonably certain to be exercised. Our lease liability represents the present value of future lease payments over the lease term. Given our policy election to combine lease and non-lease components, we also consider fixed common area maintenance (“CAM”) part of our fixed future lease payments; therefore, fixed CAM is also included in our lease liability. We cannot determine the interest rate implicit in each of our leases. Therefore, we use market and term-specific incremental borrowing rates. Our incremental borrowing rate for a lease is the rate of interest we expect to pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments under similar terms. Because we do not borrow on a collateralized basis, we consider a combination of factors, including our credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate, the risk profile and funding cost of the specific geographic market of the lease, the lease term and the effect of adjusting the rate to reflect consideration of collateral. Our credit-adjusted risk-free rate takes into consideration interest rates we pay on our unsecured long-term bonds as well as quoted interest rates obtained from financial institutions. Total lease costs recorded as rent and other occupancy costs include fixed operating lease costs, variable lease costs and short-term lease costs. Most of our real estate leases require we pay certain expenses, such as CAM costs, real estate taxes and other executory costs, of which the fixed portion is included in operating lease costs. We recognize operating lease costs on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In addition to the above costs, variable lease costs also include amounts based on a percentage of gross sales in excess of specified levels and are recognized when probable and are not included in determining the present value of our lease liability. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. A significant majority of our leases are related to our company-operated stores, and their related costs are recorded within store operating expenses. The ROU asset is measured at the initial amount of the lease liability adjusted for lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, initial direct costs and any tenant improvement allowances received. For operating leases, ROU assets are 57 Table of Contents reduced over the lease term by the recognized straight-line lease expense less the amount of accretion of the lease liability determined using the effective interest method. For finance leases, ROU assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the leased asset or the lease term. Interest expense on each finance lease liability is recognized utilizing the effective interest method. ROU assets are tested for impairment in the same manner as long-lived assets. Additionally, we monitor for events or changes in circumstances that may require a reassessment of one of our leases and determine if a remeasurement is required. During fiscal 2020, we received $ 27.6 million of COVID-19-related rent concessions for stores in our International segment generally correlating with the temporary period our stores were closed. Consistent with updated guidance from the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) in April 2020, we elected to treat COVID-19-related rent concessions as variable rent. Rent concessions were recognized as an offset to our rent expense within store operating expenses on our consolidated statement of earnings. See Note 10 , Leases, for additional details. Additionally, for the year ended September 27, 2020, we recorded $ 87.7 million in accelerated amortization and impairment of ROU assets for stores identified for closure under the restructuring of our Americas store portfolio, which were recorded in restructuring and impairments on the consolidated statement of earnings. Goodwill We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change, such as material deterioration in performance or a significant number of store closures, that would indicate that impairment may exist. When evaluating goodwill for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. Fair value is typically calculated using a discounted cash flow model. For certain reporting units, where deemed appropriate, we may also utilize a market approach for estimating fair value. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value. As part of our ongoing operations, we may close certain stores within a reporting unit containing goodwill due to underperformance of the store or inability to renew our lease, among other reasons. We may abandon certain assets associated with a closed store, including leasehold improvements and other non-transferable assets. When a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business is to be disposed of, goodwill associated with the business is included in the carrying amount of the business in determining any loss on disposal. Our evaluation of whether the portion of a reporting unit being disposed of constitutes a business occurs on the date of abandonment. Although an operating store meets the accounting definition of a business prior to abandonment, it does not constitute a business on the closure date because the remaining assets on that date do not constitute an integrated set of activities (substantive processes) and assets that are capable of being managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. As a result, when closing individual stores, we do not include goodwill in the calculation of any loss on disposal of the related assets. We recorded no goodwill impairment during fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2019 and 2018, we recorded goodwill impairment of $ 10.5 million and $ 37.6 million, respectively. See Note 8 , Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill, for further information. Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets include finite-lived intangible assets, which mainly consist of acquired and reacquired rights, trade secrets, licensing agreements, contract-based patents and copyrights. These assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment using a similar methodology to our property, plant and equipment, as described above. Indefinite-lived intangibles, which consist primarily of trade names and trademarks, are tested for impairment annually during the third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that impairment may exist. When evaluating other intangible assets for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an intangible asset group is impaired. If we do not perform the qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset group exceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset group. Fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the intangible asset group and is typically calculated using an income approach, such as a relief-from-royalty model. If the carrying amount of the intangible asset group exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value. In addition, we continuously monitor and may revise our intangible asset useful lives if and when facts and circumstances change. We recorded other intangible asset impairment charges of $ 22.1 million during fiscal 2020. There were no significant other intangible asset impairment charges recorded during fiscal 2019 and 2018. See Note 8 , Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill, for further information. 58 Table of Contents Insurance Reserves We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance treaty, to provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks, including workers’ compensation, healthcare benefits, general liability, property insurance and director and officers’ liability insurance. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by us are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographics, exposure and severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Revenue Recognition Consolidated revenues are presented net of intercompany eliminations for wholly-owned subsidiaries and investees controlled by us and for product sales to and royalty and other fees from licensees accounted for under the equity method. Additionally, consolidated revenues are recognized net of any discounts, returns, allowances and sales incentives, including coupon redemptions and rebates. Company-operated Store Revenues Company-operated store revenues are recognized when payment is tendered at the point of sale as the performance obligation has been satisfied. Company-operated store revenues are reported excluding sales, use or other transaction taxes that are collected from customers and remitted to taxing authorities. Licensed Store Revenues Licensed store revenues consist of product and equipment sales, royalties and other fees paid by licensees using the Starbucks brand. Sales of coffee, tea, food and related products are generally recognized upon shipment to licensees, depending on contract terms. Shipping charges billed to licensees are also recognized as revenue, and the related shipping costs are included in product and distribution costs on our consolidated statements of earnings. We consider pre-opening services, including site evaluation and selection, store architectural/design and development and operational training, to be performance obligations that are separate from the license to operate under the Starbucks brand. These services provide distinct value to our licensees, including business and industry insight and knowledge that transfers value apart from the license. Revenues associated with pre-opening services are recognized upon completion of the related performance obligations, generally when a store is opened. Royalty revenues are recognized based upon a percentage of reported sales, and other continuing fees, such as marketing and service fees, are recognized as the performance obligations are met. Stored Value Cards Stored value cards can be activated through various channels, including at our company-operated and most licensed store locations, online at Starbucks.com or via mobile devices held by our customers and at certain other third-party websites and locations, such as grocery stores, although they cannot be reloaded at these third-party websites or locations. Amounts loaded onto stored value cards are initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue upon redemption. Historically, the majority of stored value cards are redeemed within one year. In many of our company-owned markets, including the U.S., our stored value cards do not have an expiration date nor do we charge service fees that cause a decrement to customer balances. Based on historical redemption rates, a portion of stored value cards is not expected to be redeemed and will be recognized as breakage over time in proportion to stored value card redemptions. The redemption rates are based on historical redemption patterns for each market, including the timing and business channel in which the card was activated or reloaded, and remittance to government agencies under unclaimed property laws, if applicable. Breakage is recognized as company-operated stores and licensed stores revenue within the consolidated statement of earnings beginning in fiscal 2019 in accordance with the revenue recognition guidance that we adopted prospectively during fiscal 2019. For the fiscal years ended September 27, 2020 and September 29, 2019, we recognized breakage revenue of $ 130.3 million and $ 125.1 million in company-operated store revenues and $ 14.3 million and $ 15.7 million in licensed store revenues, respectively. Prior to the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance, breakage was recorded using the remote method and recorded in interest income and other, net. In fiscal 2018, we recognized breakage income of $ 155.9 million. 59 Table of Contents Loyalty Program Customers in the U.S., Canada and certain other countries who register their Starbucks Card are automatically enrolled in the Starbucks ® Rewards program, which is primarily a spend-based loyalty program. They earn loyalty points (“Stars”) with each purchase at participating Starbucks ® stores and when making purchases with the Starbucks-branded credit and debit cards. Beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, in addition to using their Starbucks Cards, Starbucks ® Rewards members can earn Stars by paying with cash, credit or debit cards, or selected mobile wallets at company-operated stores in the U.S. and Canada. After accumulating a certain number of Stars, the customer earns a reward that can be redeemed for free product that, regardless of where the related Stars were earned within that country, will be honored at company-operated stores and certain participating licensed store locations in that same country. We defer revenue associated with the estimated selling price of Stars earned by Starbucks ® Rewards members towards free product as each Star is earned and a corresponding liability is established in deferred revenue. This deferral is based on the estimated value of the product for which the reward is expected to be redeemed, net of estimated unredeemed Stars. Stars generally expire after six months. When a customer redeems an earned reward, we recognize revenue for the redeemed product and reduce the related deferred revenue. The revenue recognition guidance that we adopted prospectively during fiscal 2019, did not impact the timing or total revenue recognized related to the loyalty program. Other Revenues Other revenues primarily include royalty revenues, sales of packaged coffee, tea and a variety of ready-to-drink beverages and single-serve coffee and tea products to customers outside of our company-operated and licensed stores. Sales of these products are generally recognized upon shipment to customers, depending on contract terms. Beginning in late fiscal 2018, other revenues also include product sales to and licensing revenue from Nestlé related to our Global Coffee Alliance. Product sales to Nestlé are generally recognized when the product is shipped whereas royalty revenues are recognized based on a percentage of reported sales. The adoption of the revenue recognition guidance discussed above did not impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized related to other revenues. Deferred Revenues Our deferred revenue primarily consists of the up-front prepaid royalty from Nestlé, for which we have continuing performance obligations to support the Global Coffee Alliance, and our unredeemed stored value card liability and unredeemed Stars associated with our loyalty program. See Note 11 , Deferred Revenue, for further information. Disaggregation of Revenues Revenues disaggregated by segment, product type and geographic area are disclosed in Note 17 , Segment Reporting. Product and Distribution Costs Product and distribution costs primarily consist of raw materials, purchased goods and packaging costs as well as operational costs of our supply chain organization, such as wages and benefits, occupancy costs and depreciation expenses, in support of sourcing, procuring, manufacturing, warehousing and transportation activities of products sold at our company-operated and licensed stores as well as through Channel Development and our other businesses. Also included are inventory and supply chain asset impairment costs. Store Operating Expenses Store operating expenses consist of costs incurred in our company-operated stores, primarily wages and benefits related to store partners (employees), occupancy costs and other costs that directly support the operation and sales-related activities of those stores. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses primarily consist of wages and benefits, professional service fees and occupancy costs for corporate headquarter and regional offices that support our corporate functions, including technology, finance, legal and partner (employee) resources . Advertising We expense most advertising costs as they are incurred, except for certain production costs that are expensed the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expenses totaled $ 258.8 million, $ 245.7 million and $ 260.3 million in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 60 Table of Contents Government Subsidies On March 27, 2020, the U.S. government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”), which among other things, provides employer payroll tax credits for wages paid to employees who are unable to work during the COVID-19 outbreak and options to defer payroll tax payments for a limited period. Based on our evaluation of the CARES Act, we qualify for certain employer payroll tax credits as well as the deferral of payroll tax payments in the future. Additionally, the Canadian government enacted the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (“CEWS”) to help employers offset a portion of their employee wages for a limited period. We elected to treat qualified government subsidies from the U.S., Canada and other governments as offsets to the related operating expenses. During fiscal 2020, the qualified payroll credits reduced our store operating expenses by $ 349.6 million on our consolidated statement of earnings. After netting the qualified U.S. payroll tax credits against our payroll tax payable, we recorded $ 155.1 million within prepaid expenses and other current assets as of September 27, 2020. As of September 27, 2020, deferred payroll tax payments of $ 151.0 million were included in other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Store Preopening Expenses Costs incurred in connection with the start-up and promotion of new company-operated store openings are expensed as incurred. Asset Retirement Obligations We recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations (“ARO”) when such obligations are incurred. Our AROs are primarily associated with leasehold improvements, which, at the end of a lease, we are contractually obligated to remove in order to comply with the lease agreement. At the inception of a lease with such conditions, we record an ARO liability and a corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation. We estimate the liability using a number of assumptions, including store closing costs, cost inflation rates and discount rates, and accrete the liability to its projected future value over time. The capitalized asset is depreciated using the same depreciation convention as leasehold improvement assets. Upon satisfaction of the ARO conditions, any difference between the recorded ARO liability and the actual retirement costs incurred is recognized as a gain or loss in store operating expense on our consolidated statements of earnings. As of September 27, 2020 and September 29, 2019, our net ARO assets included in property, plant and equipment were $ 30.7 million and $ 23.5 million, respectively, and our net ARO liabilities included in other long-term liabilities were $ 111.0 million and $ 95.5 million, respectively. Stock-based Compensation We maintain several equity incentive plans under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) or stock appreciation rights to employees, non-employee directors and consultants. We also have an employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”). RSUs issued by us are equivalent to nonvested shares under the applicable accounting guidance. We record stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of stock awards at the grant date and recognize the expense over the related service period following a graded vesting expense schedule. Expense for performance-based RSUs is recognized when it is probable the performance goal will be achieved. Performance goals are determined by the Board of Directors and may include measures such as earnings per share, operating income and return on invested capital. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model. The assumptions used to calculate the fair value of options granted are evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect market conditions and our historical experience. The fair value of RSUs is based on the closing price of Starbucks common stock on the award date, less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. If applicable, our total shareholder return relative to our peer group is incorporated into the underlying assumptions used to calculate grant date fair value. Compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award, and only for those awards expected to vest, with forfeitures estimated at the date of grant based on our historical experience and future expectations. Foreign Currency Translation Our international operations generally use their local currency as their functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Income and expense accounts are translated at the average monthly exchange rates during the year. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of OCI and recorded in AOCI on our consolidated balance sheets. Income Taxes We compute income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred income taxes are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which 61 Table of Contents we expect the temporary differences to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred taxes is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdictions from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies and results of recent operations. If we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes. In addition, our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include review of our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions. We evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of our position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. For uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold, we record a related liability. We adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available. Starbucks recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense on our consolidated statements of earnings. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax balances on our consolidated balance sheets. Global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) provisions are applied, providing an incremental tax on foreign income. We have made a policy election to classify taxes due under the GILTI provision as a current period expense. Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock and the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period, calculated using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and RSUs. Performance-based RSUs are considered dilutive when the related performance criterion has been met. Common Stock Share Repurchases We may repurchase shares of Starbucks common stock under a program authorized by our Board of Directors, including pursuant to a contract, instruction or written plan meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under applicable Washington State law, shares repurchased are retired and not displayed separately as treasury stock on the financial statements. Instead, the par value of repurchased shares is deducted from common stock and the excess repurchase price over par value is deducted from additional paid-in capital and from retained earnings. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we adopted the new guidance from the FASB on simplifying the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles. The guidance was adopted on a prospective basis and had no material impact on the consolidated financial statements. On September 30, 2019, we adopted the new guidance from the FASB on the recognition and measurement of leases utilizing the modified retrospective approach. As a result, the prior period information reported under the previous lease guidance has not been restated. As permitted under the new FASB lease guidance, we elected the package of practical expedients, which allowed us to retain our prior conclusions regarding lease identification, classification and initial direct costs. For our lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, we elected the practical expedient to account for these as a single lease component for all underlying classes of assets. For our adoption, we did not elect to use hindsight for our existing leases. Additionally, for short-term leases with an initial lease term of 12 months or less and with purchase options we are reasonably certain will not be exercised, we elected to not record right-of-use assets or corresponding lease obligations on our consolidated balance sheet. We will continue to record rent expense for each short-term lease on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The new FASB lease guidance had a material impact on our consolidated balance sheet; however, it did not have a material impact on our consolidated statement of earnings. The most material impact was the recognition of right-of-use assets of 62 Table of Contents $ 8.4 billion upon adoption, with corresponding lease liabilities of $ 9.0 billion relating to our operating leases. Existing deferred rent and tenant improvement allowances of approximately $ 568.0 million, previously recorded within other long-term liabilities, were recorded as an offset to our gross operating lease right-of-use assets. Additionally, pursuant to the transition guidance, we derecognized build-to-suit lease assets, previously recorded in property, plant and equipment, net, along with the corresponding liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2019. Accordingly, these leases have been recorded as operating leases as of the adoption date and are now included in operating lease, right-of-use assets and operating lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. As of the adoption date, accumulated deficit within shareholder's equity on our consolidated balance sheet decreased by $ 17.3 million, primarily related to the derecognition of build-to-suit leasing arrangements. In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we adopted the new guidance from the FASB on the reclassification of certain tax effects from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”) which permits entities to reclassify the stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) from AOCI to retained earnings. The guidance was adopted prospectively with no material impact on the consolidated financial statements as of September 27, 2020. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In March 2020, the FASB issued guidance related to reference rate reform. The pronouncement provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the current guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting to ease the financial reporting burden related to the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. The guidance was effective upon issuance and generally can be applied to applicable contract modifications through December 31, 2022. We are currently evaluating the impact of the transition from LIBOR to alternative reference rates but do not expect a significant impact to our consolidated financial statements. In June 2016, the FASB issued guidance replacing the incurred loss impairment methodology with a new methodology that reflects Current Expected Credit Losses on financial assets, including receivables and available-for-sale securities. The new methodology requires entities to estimate and recognize expected credit losses each reporting period. The guidance will be applied under the modified retrospective approach and will be effective at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2021. We do not expect a material impact to our consolidated financial statements upon adoption. Note 2: Acquisitions, Divestitures and Strategic Alliance Fiscal 2019 In the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we sold our company-operated retail business in Thailand to Coffee Concepts Thailand, a joint-venture between Maxim's Caterers Limited and F&N Retail Connection Co. Ltd, converting this operation to a fully licensed market. This transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $ 601.9 million, which was included in net gains resulting from divestiture of certain operations on our consolidated statements of earnings. In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we sold our company-operated retail businesses in France and the Netherlands to Alsea, S.A.B. de C.V. converting these operations to fully licensed markets. These transactions did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Fiscal 2018 We entered into an agreement on May 6, 2018 to establish the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestlé. On August 26, 2018, Nestlé licensed the rights to market, sell and distribute Starbucks consumer packaged goods and foodservice products in authorized channels. We received an up-front payment of approximately $ 7 billion consisting primarily of prepaid royalties which was recorded to current and long-term deferred revenue. See Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for the accounting treatment. Also see Note 11 , Deferred Revenue. On March 23, 2018, we sold our company-operated retail store assets and operations in Brazil to SouthRock, converting these operations to a fully licensed market. This transaction did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. On December 31, 2017, we acquired the remaining 50 % interest of our East China joint venture (“East China”) from President Chain Store (Hong Kong) Holding Ltd. and Kai Yu (BVI) collectively, “Uni-President Group” or “UPG”, for approximately $ 1.4 billion. Approximately $ 90.5 million of pre-existing liabilities owed by East China to Starbucks were effectively settled upon the acquisition. Acquiring the remaining interest of East China, which at the time operated over 1,400 stores in the Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces, built on the Company's ongoing investment in China. The estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on valuation and analysis performed by management. Concurrently with the purchase of our East China joint venture, we sold our 50 % interest in President Starbucks Coffee Taiwan Limited, our joint venture operations in Taiwan, to UPG for approximately $ 181.2 million. The transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $ 156.6 million which was included in net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations on our consolidated statements of earnings. 63 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the preliminary allocation of the total consideration to the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of December 31, 2017 , which are reported within our International segment (in millions) : Consideration: Cash paid for UPG 50% equity interest $ 1,440.8 Fair value of our pre-existing 50% equity interest 1,440.8 Settlement of pre-existing liabilities 90.5 Total consideration $ 2,972.1 Fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed: Cash and cash equivalents $ 129.5 Accounts receivable 14.3 Inventories 16.1 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 20.6 Property, plant and equipment 254.1 Other long-term assets 44.6 Other intangible assets 818.0 Goodwill 2,164.1 Total assets acquired $ 3,461.3 Accounts payable 34.7 Accrued liabilities 187.7 Stored value card liability 21.7 Other long-term liabilities 245.1 Total liabilities assumed 489.2 Total consideration $ 2,972.1 As a result of this acquisition, we remeasured the carrying value of our preexisting 50 % equity method investment to fair value, which resulted in a total gain of $ 1.4 billion that is not subject to income tax, and was presented as gain resulting from acquisition of joint venture on our consolidated statements of earnings. The fair value of $ 1.4 billion was calculated using an income approach, which was based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represents a fair value measurement categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows included projected revenue growth and operating expenses, as well as the selection of an appropriate discount rate. Estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses were based on internal projections and considered the historical performance of stores, local market economics and the business environments impacting store performance. The discount rate applied was based on East China's weighted-average cost of capital and included company-specific and size risk premiums. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed are reported within our International segment. Other current and long-term assets acquired primarily include lease deposits and prepaid rent. Accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities assumed primarily include deferred income tax, dividend payable, accrued payroll, income tax payable and accrued occupancy costs. The definite-lived intangibles primarily relate to reacquired rights to operate stores exclusively in East China. The reacquired rights of $ 798.0 million represent the fair value calculated over the remaining original contractual period and will be amortized on a straight-line basis through September 2022. Amortization expense for these definite-lived intangible assets was $ 160.6 million and $ 163.8 million for fiscal 2020 and 2019, respectively. The estimated future amortization expense is approximately $ 157.8 million and $ 154.4 million in fiscal 2021 and 2022, respectively. Goodwill represents the intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition and primarily includes the acquired customer base, the acquired workforce including store partners in the region that have strong relationships with these customers and the existing geographic retail and online presence. The entire balance was allocated to the International segment and is not deductible for income tax purposes. Due to foreign currency translation, the balance of goodwill related to the acquisition decreased $ 102.8 million since the date of acquisition to $ 2.1 billion as of September 27, 2020. We began consolidating East China's results of operations and cash flows into our consolidated financial statements after December 31, 2017. For the year ended September 30, 2018, East China's revenue included in our consolidated statements of earnings was $ 903.0 million. For the year ended September 30, 2018, East China's net earnings included in our consolidated statements of earnings was $ 73.1 million. 64 Table of Contents The following table provides the supplemental pro forma revenue and net earnings of the combined entity had the acquisition date of East China been October 3, 2016, the first day of our first quarter of fiscal 2017, rather than the end of our first quarter of fiscal 2018 (in millions) : Year Ended Sep 30, 2018 Revenue $ 24,990.4 Net earnings attributable to Starbucks 3,196.8 The amounts in the supplemental pro forma earnings for the periods presented above fully eliminate intercompany transactions, apply our accounting policies and reflect adjustments for additional occupancy costs as well as depreciation and amortization that would have been charged assuming the same fair value adjustments to leases, property, plant and equipment and acquired intangibles had been applied on October 3, 2016. These pro forma results are unaudited and are not necessarily indicative of results of operations that would have occurred had the acquisition actually closed in the prior period or indicative of the results of operations for any future period. During the year ended September 30, 2018, we incurred approximately $ 3.6 million of acquisition-related costs, such as regulatory, legal and advisory fees, which were recorded in general and administrative expenses. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we sold the assets associated with our Tazo brand including Tazo ® signature recipes, intellectual property and inventory to Unilever for a total of $ 383.8 million. The transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $ 347.9 million, which was included in the net gain from divestiture of certain operations on our consolidated statements of earnings. Results from Tazo operations prior to the sale were reported primarily in Channel Development. Note 3: Derivative Financial Instruments Interest Rates From time to time, we enter into designated cash flow hedges to manage the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates. We enter into interest rate swap agreements and treasury locks, which are synthetic forward sales of U.S. treasury securities settled in cash based upon the difference between an agreed-upon treasury rate and the prevailing treasury rate at settlement. These agreements are cash settled at the time of the pricing of the related debt. Each derivative agreement's gain or loss is recorded in AOCI and is subsequently reclassified to interest expense over the life of the related debt. To hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap agreements, which are designated as fair value hedges. The changes in fair values of these derivative instruments and the offsetting changes in fair values of the underlying hedged debt due to changes in the relevant benchmark interest rates are recorded in interest expense. Refer to Note 9 , Debt, for additional information on our long-term debt. Foreign Currency To reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations, we enter into forward and swap contracts to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated intercompany royalty payments, inventory purchases and intercompany borrowing and lending activities. The resulting gains and losses from these derivatives are recorded in AOCI and subsequently reclassified to revenue, product and distribution costs, or interest income and other, net, respectively, when the hedged exposures affect net earnings. From time to time, we may enter into financial instruments, including, but not limited to, forward and swap contracts or foreign currency-denominated debt, to hedge the currency exposure of our net investments in certain international operations. The resulting gains and losses from these derivatives are recorded in AOCI and are subsequently reclassified to net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. Foreign currency forward and swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments are used to mitigate the foreign exchange risk of certain other balance sheet items. Gains and losses from these derivatives are largely offset by the financial impact of translating foreign currency-denominated payables and receivables; these gains and losses are recorded in interest income and other, net. Commodities Depending on market conditions, we may enter into coffee forward contracts, futures contracts and collars to hedge anticipated cash flows under our price-to-be-fixed green coffee contracts, which are described further in Note 5 , Inventories, or our longer-dated forecasted coffee demand where underlying fixed price and price-to-be-fixed contracts are not yet available. The resulting gains and losses are recorded in AOCI and are subsequently reclassified to product and distribution costs when the hedged exposure affects net earnings. 65 Table of Contents Depending on market conditions, we may also enter into dairy forward contracts and futures contracts to hedge a portion of anticipated cash flows under our dairy purchase contracts and our forecasted dairy demand. The resulting gains or losses are recorded in AOCI and are subsequently reclassified to product and distribution costs when the hedged exposure affects net earnings. Cash flow hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the inception of each hedge. Cash flows from hedging transactions are classified in the same categories as the cash flows from the respective hedged items. For de-designated cash flow hedges in which the underlying transactions are no longer probable of occurring, the related accumulated derivative gains or losses are recognized in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. During the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2020, we de-designated certain cash flow hedges due to the global COVID-19 impacts, resulting in the release of an insignificant net gain from AOCI to our consolidated statement of earnings. We continue to believe forecasted exposures relating to our other designated cash flow hedges are probable of occurring. To mitigate the price uncertainty of a portion of our future purchases, including diesel fuel and other commodities, we enter into swap contracts, futures and collars that are not designated as hedging instruments. The resulting gains and losses are recorded in interest income and other, net to help offset price fluctuations on our beverage, food, packaging and transportation costs, which are included in product and distribution costs on our consolidated statements of earnings.

Available-for-sale Debt Securities Long-term investments generally mature within 4 years. Proceeds from sales of securities were $ 177.4 million, $ 291.1 million and $ 459.0 million for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Realized gains and losses were not material for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018. Gross unrealized holding gains and losses were not material as of September 27, 2020 and September 29, 2019. Marketable Equity Securities Marketable equity securities include equity mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. Our marketable equity securities portfolio approximates a portion of our liability under our MDCP, a defined contribution plan. Our MDCP liability was $ 91.4 million and $ 92.1 million as of September 27, 2020 and September 29, 2019, respectively. The changes in net unrealized holding gains and losses in the marketable equity securities portfolio included in earnings for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018 were not material. Gross unrealized holding gains and losses on marketable equity securities were not material as of September 27, 2020 and September 29, 2019. Derivative Assets and Liabilities Derivative assets and liabilities include foreign currency forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, collars and swaps, which are described further in Note 3 , Derivative Financial Instruments. 70 Table of Contents Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include items such as property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, equity and other investments and other assets. These assets are measured at fair value if determined to be impaired. Impairment of property, plant and equipment and ROU assets is included in Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Other than the impairments discussed in Note 8 , Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill, and the aforementioned fair value adjustments, there were no other material fair value adjustments during fiscal 2020 and 2019. Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments The estimated fair value of our long-term debt based on the quoted market price (Level 2) is included at Note 9 , Debt. Note 5: Inventories (in millions) Sep 27, 2020 Sep 29, 2019 Coffee: Unroasted $ 664.7 $ 656.5 Roasted 223.5 276.5 Other merchandise held for sale 293.9 288.0 Packaging and other supplies 369.3 308.4 Total $ 1,551.4 $ 1,529.4 Other merchandise held for sale includes, among other items, serveware, food and tea. Inventory levels vary due to seasonality, commodity market supply and price fluctuations. As of September 27, 2020, we had committed to purchasing green coffee totaling $ 687 million under fixed-price contracts and an estimated $ 458 million under price-to-be-fixed contracts. A portion of our price-to-be-fixed contacts are effectively fixed through the use of futures. See Note 3 , Derivative Financial Instruments for further discussion. Price-to-be-fixed contracts are purchase commitments whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore the price, at which the base “C” coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established. For most contracts, either Starbucks or the seller has the option to “fix” the base “C” coffee commodity price prior to the delivery date. For other contracts, Starbucks and the seller may agree upon pricing parameters determined by the base “C” coffee commodity price. Until prices are fixed, we estimate the total cost of these purchase commitments. We believe, based on relationships established with our suppliers in the past and continuous monitoring of the business environment, the risk of non-delivery on these purchase commitments is remote. During fiscal 2020, we wrote off approximately $ 50 million of inventory in the second quarter that was expiring or expected to expire due to COVID-19 related store closures, primarily perishable food and beverage ingredients located at our stores, distribution centers and suppliers. This was included in product and distribution costs on our consolidated statement of earnings. We did not record significant write-offs related to COVID-19 during the second half of the fiscal year. Note 6: Equity Investments (in millions) Sep 27, 2020 Sep 29, 2019 Equity method investments $ 426.4 $ 336.1 Other investments 52.3 59.9 Total $ 478.7 $ 396.0 Equity Method Investments As of September 27, 2020, we had 50 % ownership interests in Starbucks Coffee Korea Co., Ltd. and Tata Starbucks Limited (India). These international entities operate licensed Starbucks ® retail stores. We also license the rights to produce and distribute Starbucks-branded p roducts to our 50 % owned joint venture, The North American Coffee Partnership with the Pepsi-Cola Company, which develops and distributes bottled Starbucks ® beverages, including Frappuccino ® coffee drinks, Starbucks Doubleshot ® espresso drinks, Starbucks Refreshers ® beverages, Starbucks ® Iced Espresso Classics and Starbucks ® Iced Coffee. Our share of income and losses from our equity method investments is included in income from equity investees on our consolidated statements of earnings. Also included in this line item is our proportionate share of gross profit resulting from coffee and other product sales to, and royalty and license fee revenues generated from, equity investees. Revenues generated from these entities were $ 123.9 million, $ 130.7 million and $ 112.8 million in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Related 71 Table of Contents product and distribution costs were $ 79.8 million, $ 73.2 million and $ 71.5 million in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of September 27, 2020 and September 29, 2019, there were $ 28.7 million and $ 35.5 million of accounts receivable from equity investees, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets, primarily related to product sales and royalty revenues. Other Investments We have equity interests in entities that develop and operate Starbucks licensed stores in several global markets, as well as in companies that support our strategic initiatives. We do not have significant influence over these entities and their fair values are not readily determinable. Therefore, we elected to measure these investments at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairment.

The results of our analysis indicated significant excess fair values over carrying values across the different reporting units, and therefore no goodwill impairment was recorded. Due to changes in branding and marketing strategy, certain indefinite-lived intangible assets became definite-lived. As a result, approximately $ 105.5 million was reclassified primarily into Trade names, trademarks and patents within the Finite-Lived Intangible Assets table below. We estimated the fair values of these assets under an income approach with an average remaining useful life of approximately five years. The analysis indicated that the fair value of one of the assets exceeded its carrying value. As a result, we recorded a charge of $ 22.1 million to restructuring and impairments on our consolidated statement of earnings during the third quarter of fiscal 2020. For our remaining intangible assets, our analysis did not indicate further impairment.

Note 9: Debt Revolving Credit Facility Our $ 2.0 billion unsecured 5-year revolving credit facility (the “2018 credit facility”) and our $ 1.0 billion unsecured 364-Day credit facility (the “364-day credit facility”) are available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases. The 2018 credit facility, of which $ 150 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit, is currently set to mature on October 25, 2022 . We have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $ 500 million. Borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR, and, for U.S. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on the better of (i) the Company's long-term credit ratings assigned by Moody's and Standard & Poor's rating agencies and (ii) the Company's fixed charge coverage ratio, pursuant to a pricing grid set forth in the five-year credit agreement. The current applicable margin is 1.100 % for Eurocurrency Rate Loans and 0.000 % (nil) for Base Rate Loans. The 364-day credit facility, of which no amount may be used for issuances of letters of credit, has been extended to mature on September 22, 2021 .

The applicable margin is 1.150 % for Eurocurrency Rate Loans and 0.150 % for Base Rate Loans. Both credit facilities contain provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which measures our ability to cover financing expenses. As of September 27, 2020, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. No amounts were outstanding under our 2018 credit facility or our 364-day credit facility as of September 27, 2020. Short-term Debt Under our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $ 3.0 billion, with individual maturities that may vary but not exceed 397 days from the date of issue.

The proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper program may be used for working capital needs, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, business expansion, payment of cash dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. As of September 27, 2020, we had $ 296.5 million borrowings outstanding under the program, net of unamortized discount, of which a majority matures in the second quarter of fiscal 2021.

The up-front payment of approximately $ 7 billion was recorded as deferred revenue as we have continuing performance obligations to support the Global Coffee Alliance, including providing Nestlé access to certain intellectual properties and products for future resale. The up-front payment will be recognized as other revenue on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life of the arrangement of 40 years for the ongoing access to the licenses within the contractual territories. Our obligations to maintain the Starbucks brand and other intellectual properties are generally constant throughout the term of the arrangement. Therefore, a ratable recognition pattern is reflective of how we satisfy our performance obligations.

Note 13: Employee Stock and Benefit Plans We maintain several equity incentive plans under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) or stock appreciation rights to employees, non-employee directors and consultants. We issue new shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options and the vesting of RSUs. We also have an employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”). As of September 27, 2020, there were 46.5 million shares of common stock available for issuance pursuant to future equity-based compensation awards and 11.9 million shares available for issuance under our ESPP. 81 Table of Contents Stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements (in millions) : Fiscal Year Ended Sep 27, 2020 Sep 29, 2019 Sep 30, 2018 Options $ 7.5 $ 20.0 $ 28.0 RSUs 241.0 288.0 222.3 Total stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings $ 248.5 $ 308.0 $ 250.3 Total related tax benefit $ 47.8 $ 59.3 $ 62.4 Total capitalized stock-based compensation included in net property, plant and equipment on the consolidated balance sheets $ 3.6 $ 3.4 $ 3.5 Stock Option Plans We provide stock options as a form of employee compensation, which are primarily time-vested. The majority of time-vested options become exercisable in four equal installments beginning a year from the grant date and generally expire 10 years from the grant date. Options granted to non-employee directors generally vest immediately or one year from grant. All outstanding stock options are non-qualified stock options. The fair value of stock option awards was estimated at the grant date with the following weighted average assumptions for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018: Stock Options Granted During the Period Fiscal Year Ended 2020 2019 2018 Expected term (in years) 7.8 4.1 3.6 Expected stock price volatility 27.3 % 21.6 % 20.5 % Risk-free interest rate 1.2 % 2.9 % 2.1 % Expected dividend yield 2.9 % 2.1 % 2.2 % Weighted average grant price $ 56.33 $ 67.33 $ 56.56 Estimated fair value per option granted $ 11.30 $ 11.06 $ 7.32 The expected term of the options represents the estimated period of time until exercise and is based on historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior. Expected stock price volatility is based on a combination of historical volatility of our stock and the one-year implied volatility of Starbucks traded options, for the related vesting periods. The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term. The dividend yield assumption is based on our anticipated cash dividend payouts. The amounts shown above for the estimated fair value per option granted are before the estimated effect of forfeitures, which reduce the amount of expense recorded in the consolidated statements of earnings.

As of September 27, 2020, total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to nonvested options was approximately $ 1 million, before income taxes, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.0 year. The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $ 236 million, $ 466 million and 82 Table of Contents $ 236 million during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The total fair value of options vested was $ 25 million, $ 31 million and $ 53 million during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. RSUs We have both time-vested and performance-based RSUs. Time-vested RSUs are awarded to eligible employees and entitle the grantee to receive shares of common stock at the end of a vesting period, subject solely to the employee’s continuing employment. The time-vested RSUs either vest in two or four equal annual installments beginning a year from the grant date. Our performance-based RSUs are awarded to eligible employees and entitle the grantee to receive shares of common stock if we achieve specified performance goals during the performance period and the grantee remains employed through the vesting period. RSU transactions for the year ended September 27, 2020 (in millions, except per share and contractual life amounts) : Number of Shares Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value per Share Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life (Years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value Nonvested, September 29, 2019 8.9 $ 62.56 1.1 $ 788 Granted 4.0 81.96 Vested ( 3.5 ) 59.97 Forfeited/canceled ( 1.1 ) 71.88 Nonvested, September 27, 2020 8.3 74.23 1.1 699 For fiscal 2019 and 2018, the weighted average fair value per RSU granted was $ 68.14 and $ 56.48 , respectively. As of September 27, 2020, total unrecogniz ed stock-based compensation expense related to nonvested RSUs, net of estimated forfeitures, was approximately $ 134 million, before income taxes, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.9 years. The total fair value of RSUs vested was $ 211 million, $ 255 million and $ 166 million during fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. ESPP Our ESPP allows eligible employees to contribute up to 10 % of their base earnings toward the quarterly purchase of our common stock, subject to an annual maximum dollar amount. The purchase price is 95 % of the fair market value of the stock on the last business day of the quarterly offering period. The number of shares issued under our ESPP was 0.5 million in fiscal 2020. Deferred Compensation Plan We have a Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors under which non-employee directors may, for any fiscal year, irrevocably elect to defer receipt of shares of common stock the director would have received upon vesting of restricted stock units. The number of deferred shares outstanding related to deferrals made under this plan is not material. Defined Contribution Plans We maintain voluntary defined contribution plans, both qualified and non-qualified, covering eligible employees as defined in the plan documents. Participating employees may elect to defer and contribute a portion of their eligible compensation to the plans up to limits stated in the plan documents, not to exceed the dollar amounts set by applicable laws. Our matching contributions to all U.S. and non-U.S. plans were $ 132.7 million, $ 122.1 million and $ 111.7 million in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Uncertain Tax Positions As of September 27, 2020, we had $ 123.7 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits of which $ 103.0 million, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. We recognized an expense of $ 3.0 million, a benefit of $ 2.8 million and a benefit of $ 0.5 million of interest and penalties in income tax expense, prior to the benefit of the federal tax deduction, for fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. As of September 27, 2020 and September 29, 2019, we had accrued interest and penalties of $ 13.0 million and $ 10.0 million, respectively, within our consolidated balance sheets.

We are no longer subject to U.S. federal examination for years prior to fiscal 2017. 85 Table of Contents We are no longer subject to U.S. state and local examinations for years prior to fiscal 2011. We are no longer subject to examination in any material international markets prior to 2015. It is reasonably possible that up to $ 39 million of the Company's gross unrecognized tax benefits may be recognized by the end of fiscal 2021 for reasons such as a lapse of the statute of limitations or resolution of examinations with tax authorities. Note 15: Earnings per Share Calculation of net earnings per common share (“EPS”) — basic and diluted (in millions, except EPS) : Fiscal Year Ended Sep 27, 2020 Sep 29, 2019 Sep 30, 2018 Net earnings attributable to Starbucks $ 928.3 $ 3,599.2 $ 4,518.3 Weighted average common shares outstanding (for basic calculation) 1,172.8 1,221.2 1,382.7 Dilutive effect of outstanding common stock options and RSUs 9.0 12.0 11.9 Weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding (for diluted calculation) 1,181.8 1,233.2 1,394.6 EPS — basic $ 0.79 $ 2.95 $ 3.27 EPS — diluted $ 0.79 $ 2.92 $ 3.24 Potential dilutive shares consist of the incremental common shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options (both vested and non-vested) and unvested RSUs, calculated using the treasury stock method. The calculation of dilutive shares outstanding excludes out-of-the-money stock options (i.e., such options’ exercise prices were greater than the average market price of our common shares for the period) because their inclusion would have been antidilutive. As of September 27, 2020 and September 29, 2019, we had no out-of-the-money stock options compared to 14.1 million as of September 30, 2018. Note 16: Commitments and Contingencies Legal Proceedings On April 13, 2010, an organization named Council for Education and Research on Toxics (“Plaintiff”) filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles, against the Company and certain other defendants who manufacture, package, distribute or sell brewed coffee. The lawsuit is Council for Education and Research on Toxics v. Starbucks Corporation, et al . On May 9, 2011, the Plaintiff filed an additional lawsuit in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles, against the Company and additional defendants who manufacture, package, distribute or sell packaged coffee. The lawsuit is Council for Education and Research on Toxics v. Brad Barry LLC, et al .. Both cases have since been consolidated and now include nearly eighty defendants, which constitute the great majority of the coffee industry in California. Plaintiff alleges that the Company and the other defendants failed to provide warnings for their coffee products of exposure to the chemical acrylamide as required under California Health and Safety Code section 25249.5, the California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, better known as Proposition 65. Plaintiff seeks equitable relief, including providing warnings to consumers of coffee products, as well as civil penalties in the amount of the statutory maximum of two thousand five hundred dollars per day per violation of Proposition 65. The Plaintiff asserts that every consumed cup of coffee, absent a compliant warning, is equivalent to a violation under Proposition 65. The Company, as part of a joint defense group organized to defend against the lawsuit, disputes the claims of the Plaintiff. Acrylamide is not added to coffee but is present in all coffee in small amounts (parts per billion) as a byproduct of the coffee bean roasting process. The Company has asserted multiple affirmative defenses. Trial of the first phase of the case commenced on September 8, 2014, and was limited to three affirmative defenses shared by all defendants. On September 1, 2015, the trial court issued a final ruling adverse to defendants on all Phase 1 defenses. Trial of the second phase of the case commenced in the fall of 2017. On May 7, 2018, the trial court issued a ruling adverse to defendants on the Phase 2 defense, the Company's last remaining defense to liability. On June 22, 2018, the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) proposed a new regulation clarifying that cancer warnings are not required for coffee under Proposition 65. The case was set to proceed to a third phase trial on damages, remedies and attorneys' fees on October 15, 2018. However, on October 12, 2018, the California Court of Appeal granted the defendants request for a stay of the Phase 3 trial. On June 3, 2019, the Office of Administrative Law (OAL) approved the coffee exemption regulation. The regulation will be effective on October 1, 2019. On June 24, 2019, the Court of Appeal lifted the stay of the litigation. At the status conference on August 25, 2020, the trial judge granted the defendants’ motion for summary judgment, ruling that the coffee exemption regulation is a complete defense to the Plaintiff’s complaint. The Notice of Entry of Judgment from the court was served on October 6, 2020. The plaintiff has not yet filed a Notice of Appeal. Starbucks believes that the likelihood that the Company will ultimately incur a loss in connection with this litigation is less than reasonably possible. Accordingly, no loss contingency was recorded for this matter. 86 Table of Contents Starbucks is party to various other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including certain employment litigation cases that have been certified as class or collective actions, but, except as noted above, is not currently a party to any legal proceeding that management believes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Note 17: Segment Reporting Segment information is prepared on the same basis that our ceo, who is our Chief Operating Decision Maker, manages the segments, evaluates financial results and makes key operating decisions. We have three reportable operating segments: 1) Americas, which is inclusive of the U.S., Canada and Latin America; 2) International, which is inclusive of China, Japan, Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East and Africa; and 3) Channel Development. Americas and International operations sell coffee and other beverages, complementary food, packaged coffees, single-serve coffee products and a focused selection of merchandise through company-operated stores and licensed stores. Our Americas segment is our most mature business and has achieved significant scale. Channel Development revenues include packaged coffee sales, tea and ready-to-drink beverages to customers outside of our company-operated and licensed stores. Historically revenues have included domestic and international sales of our packaged coffee, tea and ready-to-drink products to grocery, warehouse club and specialty retail stores and through institutional foodservice companies which serviced businesses. Since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, most of our Channel Development revenues are from product sales to and royalty revenues from Nestlé. The collaborative business relationships for ready-to-drink products and the associated revenues remain unchanged due to the Global Coffee Alliance.

Revenues are shown based on the geographic location of our customers. Revenues from countries other than the U.S. and China consist primarily of revenues from Japan, Canada and the U.K., which together account for approximately 78 % of net revenues from other countries for fiscal 2020. Management evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net revenues and operating income. The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. 87 Table of Contents Operating income represents earnings before other income and expenses and income taxes. The identifiable assets by segment disclosed in this note are those assets specifically identifiable within each segment and include cash and cash equivalents, ROU assets, net property, plant and equipment, equity and cost investments, goodwill and other intangible assets.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 27, 2020 and September 29, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 27, 2020, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 27, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 12, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Changes in Accounting Principle As discussed in Notes 1 and 10 to the financial statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for leases effective September 30, 2019, due to adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) No. 842, Leases. The Company adopted the new lease standard using the transition method provided in Accounting Standards Updated (ASU) No. 2018-11 such that prior period amounts are not adjusted and continue to be reported in accordance with ASC 840, Leases. The adoption of the new leasing standard is also communicated as a critical audit matter below. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Leases — Incremental Borrowing Rate Used in Adoption of ASC 842 - Refer to Notes 1 and 10 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description The Company adopted the provisions of ASC 842, Leases, as of September 30, 2019. In doing so, the Company recorded lease liabilities for the present value of its leases of $9.0 billion and corresponding right-of-use (ROU) assets of $8.4 billion. The Company has disclosed the impact of adoption in Note 1 to its 2020 financial statements. In determining the lease liabilities and ROU assets, the Company derived market and term-specific incremental borrowing rates (IBRs) to calculate the present value of its lease payments. The determination of an IBR for each lease, requires management to consider a combination of factors, including its credit-adjusted risk-free interest rate, the risk profile and funding cost of the specific geographic market of the lease, the lease term and the effect of adjusting the rate to reflect consideration of collateral. 89 Table of Contents Given the company-specific factors and judgments in the model used by management to develop the IBRs for its leases at adoption, the auditing of the IBRs involved a high degree of auditor judgment, including the need to involve our fair value specialists. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the IBRs used in the adoption of ASC 842, which thereby determined the adoption disclosed in the September 27, 2020 financial statements, included the following, among others: • We tested the effectiveness of controls over the determination and calculation of the IBRs. • With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the methods and assumptions used by management to estimate the IBRs and tested the inputs used by management to develop the IBRs. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Seattle, Washington November 12, 2020 We have served as the Company's auditor since 1987. 90 Table of Contents Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure Not applicable. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of the end of the period covered by this report (September 27, 2020). There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect internal control over financial reporting. The certifications required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 are filed as exhibits 31. 1 and 31.2 , respectively, to this 10-K. Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework , issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. This evaluation included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 27, 2020. Our internal control over financial reporting as of September 27, 2020 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein. 91 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Starbucks Corporation Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Starbucks Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of September 27, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 27, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended September 27, 2020, of the Company and our report dated November 12, 2020, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements and included an explanatory paragraph relating to the Company’s adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) No. 842, Leases. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Seattle, Washington November 12, 2020 92 Table of Contents Item 9B.

Business General Starbucks is the premier roaster, marketer and retailer of specialty coffee in the world, operating in 81 markets. Formed in 1985, Starbucks Corporation’s common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market (“NASDAQ”) under the symbol “SBUX.” We purchase and roast high-quality coffees that we sell, along with handcrafted coffee, tea and other beverages and a variety of high-quality food items through company-operated stores. We also sell a variety of coffee and tea products and license our trademarks through other channels such as licensed stores, as well as grocery and foodservice through our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestlé S. A. (""Nestlé""). In addition to our flagship Starbucks Coffee brand, we sell goods and services under the following brands: Teavana, Seattle’s Best Coffee, Evolution Fresh, Ethos, Starbucks Reserve and Princi. Our objective is to maintain Starbucks standing as one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world. To achieve this, we are continuing the disciplined expansion of our global store base, adding stores in both existing, developed markets such as the U.S., and in newer, higher growth markets such as China, as well as optimizing the mix of company-operated and licensed stores around the world. In addition, by leveraging the experience gained through our traditional store model, we continue to offer consumers new coffee and other products in a variety of forms, across new categories, diverse channels and alternative store formats. We also believe our Starbucks Global Social Impact strategy, commitments related to ethically sourcing high-quality coffee, contributing positively to the communities we do business in and being an employer of choice are contributors to our objective. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“10-K” or “Report”) for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2019 (“fiscal 2019 ”), Starbucks Corporation (together with its subsidiaries) is referred to as “Starbucks,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our.” Segment Financial Information Segment information is prepared on the same basis that our management reviews financial information for operational decision-making purposes. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we realigned Starbucks operating segment reporting structure to better reflect the cumulative effect of our streamlining efforts. Specifically, our previous China/Asia Pacific (""CAP"") segment and Europe, Middle East, and Africa (""EMEA"") segment have been combined into one International segment. Concurrently, results of Siren Retail, a non-reportable operating segment consisting of Starbucks Reserve TM Roastery & Tasting Rooms, certain stores under the Starbucks Reserve brand and Princi operations, which were previously included within Corporate and Other, are now reported within the Americas and International segments based on the geographical location of the operations. We have three reportable operating segments: 1) Americas, which is inclusive of the U.S., Canada, and Latin America; 2) International, which is inclusive of China, Japan, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East, and Africa; and 3) Channel Development. Non-reportable operating segments such as Evolution Fresh and unallocated corporate expenses are reported within Corporate and Other. Revenues from our reportable operating segments as a percentage of total net revenues for fiscal 2019 were as follows: Americas ( 69% ), International ( 23% ) and Channel Development ( 8% ). Our Americas and International segments include both company-operated and licensed stores. Our Americas segment is our most mature business and has achieved significant scale. Certain markets within our International operations are either in various stages of development or undergoing transformations of their business models. Therefore, they may require a more extensive support organization, relative to their current levels of revenue and operating income, than our Americas operations. Our Channel Development segment includes roasted whole bean and ground coffees, Seattle's Best Coffee ® , Starbucks- and Teavana-branded single-serve products, a variety of ready-to-drink beverages, such as Frappuccino ® , Starbucks Doubleshot ® , Starbucks Refreshers ® beverages and Teavana TM/MC iced tea, and other branded products sold worldwide outside of our company-operated and licensed stores. Historically our consumer packaged goods (""CPG"") have been sold directly to grocery, warehouse club and specialty retail stores and through institutional foodservice companies. With the establishment of the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestlé, a large portion of our Channel Development business transitioned to a licensed model in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Our collaborative relationships with PepsiCo, Inc., Anheuser-Busch InBev, Tingyi Holding Corp., Arla Foods and others for our global ready-to-drink beverage businesses in this segment are excluded from the Global Coffee Alliance. 2 Table of Contents Revenue Components We generate the majority of our revenues through company-operated stores and licensed stores. Company-operated and Licensed Store Summary as of September 29, 2019 Americas As a% of Total Americas Stores International As a% of Total International Stores Total As a% of Total Stores Company-operated stores 9,974 55 % 5,860 44 % 15,834 51 % Licensed stores 8,093 45 % 7,329 56 % 15,422 49 % Total 18,067 100 % 13,189 100 % 31,256 100 % The mix of company-operated versus licensed stores in a given market will vary based on several factors, including our ability to access desirable local retail space, the complexity, profitability and expected ultimate size of the market for Starbucks and our ability to leverage the support infrastructure within a geographic region. Company-operated Stores Revenue from company-operated stores accounted for 81% of total net revenues during fiscal 2019 . Our retail objective is to be the leading retailer and brand of coffee and tea in each of our target markets by selling the finest quality coffee, tea and related products, as well as complementary food offerings, and by providing each customer with a unique Starbucks Experience . The Starbucks Experience is built upon superior customer service and a seamless digital experience as well as clean and well-maintained stores that reflect the personalities of the communities in which they operate, thereby building a high degree of customer loyalty. Our strategy for expanding our global retail business is to increase our market share in a disciplined manner, by selectively opening additional stores in new and existing markets, as well as increasing sales in existing stores, to support our long-term strategic objective to maintain Starbucks standing as one of the most recognized and respected brands in the world. Store growth in specific existing markets will vary due to many factors, including expected financial returns, the maturity of the market, economic conditions, consumer behavior and local business practices.

Our ability to vary the size and format of our stores allows us to locate them in or near a variety of settings, including downtown and suburban retail centers, office buildings, university campuses and in select rural and off-highway locations. We are continuing the expansion of our stores, particularly Drive Thru formats that provide a higher degree of access and convenience, and alternative store formats, which are focused on an elevated Starbucks Experience for our customers.

Stored Value Cards and Loyalty Program The Starbucks Card, our branded stored value card program, is designed to provide customers with a convenient payment method, support gifting and increase the frequency of store visits by cardholders, in part through the related Starbucks ® Rewards loyalty program where available, as discussed below. Stored value cards are issued to customers when they initially load them with an account balance. They can be obtained in our company-operated and most licensed stores in North America, China, Japan, and many of our markets in our International segment. Stored value cards can also be obtained on-line, via the Starbucks ® Mobile App, and through other U.S. and international retailers. Customers may access their card balances by utilizing their stored value card or the Starbucks ® Mobile App in participating stores. Using the Mobile Order and Pay functionality of the Starbucks ® Mobile App, customers can also place orders in advance for pick-up at certain participating locations in several markets. In nearly all markets, including the U.S. and Canada, customers who register their Starbucks Cards are automatically enrolled in the Starbucks Rewards program. Registered members can receive various benefits depending on factors such as the number of reward points (“Stars”) earned. Refer to Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, for further discussion of our stored value cards and loyalty program. Licensed Stores Revenues from our licensed stores accounted for 11% of total net revenues in fiscal 2019 . Licensed stores generally have a lower gross margin and a higher operating margin than company-operated stores. Under the licensed model, Starbucks receives a margin on branded products and supplies sold to the licensed store operator along with a royalty on retail sales. Licensees are responsible for operating costs and capital investments which more than offset the lower revenues we receive under the licensed store model. In our licensed store operations, we leverage the expertise of our local partners and share our operating and store development experience. Licensees provide improved, and at times the only, access to desirable retail space. Most licensees are prominent retailers with in-depth market knowledge and access. As part of these arrangements, we sell coffee, tea, food and related products to licensees for resale to customers and receive royalties and license fees from the licensees. We also sell certain equipment, such as coffee brewers and espresso machines, to our licensees for use in their operations. Employees working in licensed retail locations are required to follow our detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to employees in company-operated stores. In a limited number of international markets, we also use traditional franchising and include these stores in the results of operations from our other licensed stores. 4 Table of Contents Licensed store data for the year-ended September 29, 2019 : Stores Open as of Stores Open as of Sep 30, 2018 Opened Closed Transfers Net Sep 29, 2019 Americas: U.S. 6,031 318 (99 ) — 219 6,250 Mexico 708 49 (9 ) — 40 748 Latin America 622 45 (4 ) — 41 663 Canada 409 34 (11 ) — 23 432 Total Americas 7,770 446 (123 ) — 323 8,093 International (1) : Korea 1,231 128 (25 ) — 103 1,334 U.K. 653 60 (6 ) — 54 707 Turkey 453 47 (6 ) — 41 494 Taiwan 458 35 (13 ) — 22 480 Indonesia 365 56 — — 56 421 Philippines 360 39 (2 ) — 37 397 Thailand — 15 — 377 392 392 All Other 2,681 396 (55 ) 82 423 3,104 Total International 6,201 776 (107 ) 459 1,128 7,329 Corporate and Other: Teavana 12 — (12 ) — (12 ) — Total Corporate and Other 12 — (12 ) — (12 ) — Total licensed 13,983 1,222 (242 ) 459 1,439 15,422 (1) International store data includes the transfer of 377 company-operated stores in Thailand to licensed stores as a result of the sale of operations late in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, and the transfer of 82 company-operated stores in France and the Netherlands to licensed stores as a result of the sales of operations in the second quarter of fiscal 2019. Other Revenues Other revenues primarily are recorded in our Channel Development segment and include sales of packaged coffee, tea and ready-to-drink beverages to customers outside of our company-operated and licensed stores. Historically, revenues have included domestic and international sales of our packaged coffee, tea and ready-to-drink products to grocery, warehouse club and specialty retail stores and through institutional foodservice companies. With the establishment of the Global Coffee Alliance in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, other revenues include product sales to and licensing revenue from Nestlé under this arrangement and the amortization of the up-front prepaid royalty. See Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies - Deferred Revenues, for further information. Our collaborative relationships with PepsiCo, Inc., Anheuser-Busch InBev, Tingyi Holding Corp., Arla Foods and others for our global ready-to-drink beverages businesses in this segment are excluded from the Global Coffee Alliance. Product Supply Starbucks is committed to selling the finest whole bean coffees and coffee beverages. To ensure compliance with our rigorous coffee standards, we control substantially all coffee purchasing, roasting and packaging and the global distribution of coffee used in our operations. We purchase green coffee beans from multiple coffee-producing regions around the world and custom roast them to our exacting standards for our many blends and single origin coffees. The price of coffee is subject to significant volatility. Although most coffee trades in the commodity market, high-altitude arabica coffee of the quality sought by Starbucks tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the “C” coffee commodity price. Both the premium and the commodity price depend upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase. Supply and price can be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, including weather, natural disasters, crop disease, general increase in farm inputs and costs of production, inventory levels and political and economic conditions. Price is also impacted by trading activities in the arabica coffee futures market, including hedge funds and commodity index funds. In 5 Table of Contents addition, green coffee prices have been affected in the past, and may be affected in the future, by the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies. We buy coffee using fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed purchase commitments, depending on market conditions, to secure an adequate supply of quality green coffee. We also utilize forward contracts, futures contracts, and collars to hedge ""C"" price exposure under our price-to-be-fixed green coffee contracts and our long-term forecasted coffee demand where underlying fixed price and price-to-be-fixed contracts are not yet available. Total purchase commitments, together with existing inventory, are expected to provide an adequate supply of green coffee through fiscal 2020 . We depend upon our relationships with coffee producers, outside trading companies and exporters for our supply of green coffee. We believe, based on relationships established with our suppliers, the risk of non-delivery on such purchase commitments is remote. To help ensure the future supply of high-quality green coffee and to reinforce our leadership role in the coffee industry, Starbucks operates nine farmer support centers. The farmer support centers are staffed with agronomists and sustainability experts who work with coffee farming communities to promote best practices in coffee production designed to improve both coffee quality and yields and agronomy support to address climate and other impacts. In addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products, particularly fluid milk, to support the needs of our company-operated stores. We believe, based on relationships established with our dairy suppliers, that the risk of non-delivery of sufficient fluid milk to support our stores is remote. Products other than whole bean coffees and coffee beverages sold in Starbucks ® stores include tea and a number of ready-to-drink beverages that are purchased from several specialty suppliers, usually under long-term supply contracts. Food products, such as pastries, breakfast sandwiches and lunch items, are purchased from national, regional and local sources. We also purchase a broad range of paper and plastic products, such as cups and cutlery, from several companies to support the needs of our retail stores as well as our manufacturing and distribution operations. We believe, based on relationships established with these suppliers and manufacturers, that the risk of non-delivery of sufficient amounts of these items is remote. Competition Our primary competitors for coffee beverage sales are specialty coffee shops. We believe that our customers choose among specialty coffee retailers primarily on the basis of product quality, service and convenience, as well as price. We continue to experience direct competition from large competitors in the quick-service restaurant sector and the ready-to-drink coffee beverage market, in addition to both well-established and start-up companies in many international markets. We also compete with restaurants and other specialty retailers for prime retail locations and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores. Our coffee and tea products sold through our Channel Development segment compete directly against specialty coffees and teas sold through grocery stores, warehouse clubs, specialty retailers, convenience stores and foodservice accounts and compete indirectly against all other coffees and teas on the market. Trademarks, Copyrights, Patents and Domain Names Starbucks owns and has applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and in other countries throughout the world. Some of our trademarks, including Starbucks, the Starbucks logo, Starbucks Reserve, Seattle’s Best Coffee, Teavana, Frappuccino and Starbucks VIA are of material importance. The duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country. However, trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained. We own numerous copyrights for items such as product packaging, promotional materials, in-store graphics and training materials. We also hold patents on certain products, systems and designs. In addition, Starbucks has registered and maintains numerous Internet domain names, including “Starbucks.com,” “Starbucks.net,” “Starbucksreserve.com,” “Seattlesbest.com” and “Teavana.com.” Seasonality and Quarterly Results Our business is subject to moderate seasonal fluctuations, of which our fiscal second quarter typically experiences lower revenues and operating income. Additionally, as Starbucks Cards are issued to and loaded by customers during the holiday season, we tend to have higher cash flows from operations during the first quarter of the fiscal year. However, since revenues from Starbucks Cards are recognized upon redemption and not when cash is loaded onto the Card, the impact of seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings is much less pronounced. As a result of moderate seasonal fluctuations, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year. 6 Table of Contents Employees Starbucks employed approximately 346,000 people worldwide as of September 29, 2019 . In the U.S., Starbucks employed approximately 218,000 people, with approximately 209,000 in company-operated stores and the remainder in support facilities, store development, roasting, manufacturing, warehousing and distribution operations. Approximately 128,000 employees were employed outside of the U.S., with approximately 124,000 in company-operated stores and the remainder in regional support operations. The number of Starbucks employees represented by unions is not significant. We believe our current relations with our employees are good.

Risk Factors You should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations section and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. If any of the risks and uncertainties described in the cautionary factors described below actually occur or continue to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected. Moreover, the risks below are not the only risks we face and additional risks not currently known to us or that we presently deem immaterial may emerge or become material at any time and may negatively impact our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations or the trading price of our common stock. • Economic conditions in the U.S. and international markets could adversely affect our business and financial results. As a retailer that is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending, our results of operations are sensitive to changes in or uncertainty about macro-economic conditions. Our customers may have or in the future have less money for discretionary purchases and may stop or reduce their purchases of our products or switch to Starbucks or competitors' lower-priced products as a result of various factors, including job losses, inflation, higher taxes, reduced access to credit, changes in federal economic policy and recent international trade disputes. Decreases in customer traffic and/or average value per transaction without a corresponding decrease in costs would put downward pressure on margins and would negatively impact our financial results. There is also a risk that if negative economic conditions or uncertainty persist for a long period of time or worsen, consumers may make long-lasting changes to their discretionary purchasing behavior, including less frequent discretionary purchases on a more permanent basis or there may be a general downturn in the restaurant industry. • Our success depends substantially on the value of our brands and failure to preserve their value could have a negative impact on our financial results. We believe we have built an excellent reputation globally for the quality of our products, for delivery of a consistently positive consumer experience and for our global social impact programs. The Starbucks brand is recognized throughout the world, and we have received high ratings in global brand value studies. To be successful in the future, particularly outside of the U.S. where the Starbucks brand and our other brands are less well-known, we believe we must preserve, grow and leverage the value of our brands across all sales channels. Brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of subjective qualities. Business incidents, whether isolated or recurring and whether originating from us or our business partners, that erode consumer trust can significantly reduce brand value, potentially trigger boycotts of our stores or result in civil or criminal liability and can have a negative impact on our financial results. Such incidents include actual or perceived breaches of privacy or violations of domestic or international privacy laws, contaminated food, product recalls, store employees or other food handlers infected with communicable diseases or other potential incidents discussed in this risk factors section. The impact of such incidents may be exacerbated if they receive considerable publicity, including rapidly through social or digital media (including for malicious reasons) or result in litigation. Consumer demand for our products and our brand equity could diminish significantly if we, our employees, licensees or other business partners fail to preserve the quality of our products, act or are perceived to act in an unethical, illegal, racially-biased, unequal or socially irresponsible manner, including with respect to the sourcing, content or sale of our products, service and treatment of customers at Starbucks stores, or the use of customer data for general or direct marketing or other purposes. Additionally, if we fail to comply with laws and regulations, publicly take controversial positions or actions or fail to deliver a consistently positive consumer experience in each of our markets, including by failing to invest in the right balance of wages and benefits to attract and retain employees that represent the brand well, our brand value may be diminished. 9 Table of Contents • If our business partners and third-party providers do not satisfactorily fulfill their responsibilities and commitments, it could damage our brand and our financial results could suffer. Our global business strategy, including our plans for new stores, branded products and other initiatives, relies significantly on a variety of business partners, including licensee and joint venture relationships, third-party manufacturers, distributors and retailers, particularly for our entire global Channel Development business. Licensees, retailers and foodservice operators are often authorized to use our logos and provide branded food, beverage and other products directly to customers. We believe our customers expect the same quality of service regardless of whether they visit a licensed or company-operated store, so we provide training and support to, and monitor the operations of, certain of these licensees and other business partners. However, the product quality and service they deliver may still be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control. We also source our food, beverage and other products from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners and in certain cases such products are produced or sourced by our licensees directly. And although foodservice operators are authorized to use our logos and provide branded products as part of their foodservice business, we do not monitor the quality of non-Starbucks products served in those locations. Additionally, inconsistent uses of our brand and other of our intellectual property assets, as well as failure to protect our intellectual property, can erode consumer trust and our brand value and have a material negative impact on our financial results. • Incidents involving food or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, adulteration, contamination or mislabeling, whether or not accurate, as well as adverse public or medical opinions about the health effects of consuming our products, could harm our business. Instances or reports, whether true or not, of unclean water supply or food-safety issues, such as food or beverage-borne illnesses, tampering, adulteration, contamination or mislabeling, either during growing, manufacturing, packaging, storing or preparation, have in the past severely injured the reputations of companies in the food and beverage processing, grocery and quick-service restaurant sectors. Any report linking us to such instances could severely hurt our sales and could possibly lead to product liability claims, litigation (including class actions) and/or temporary store closures. Clean water is critical to the preparation of coffee, tea and other beverages, as well as ice for our cold beverages, and our ability to ensure a clean water and ice supply to our stores can be limited, particularly in some international locations. We are also continuing to incorporate more products in our food and beverage lineup that require freezing or refrigeration, which increases the risk of food safety related incidents if correct temperatures are not maintained due to mechanical malfunction or human error. We also face risk by relying on third-party food suppliers to provide and transport ingredients and finished products to our stores. We monitor the operations of certain of these business partners, but the product quality and service they deliver may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control and it may be difficult to detect contamination or other defect in these products. Additionally, we are evolving our product lineup to include more local or smaller suppliers for some of our products who may not have as rigorous quality and safety systems and protocols as larger or more national suppliers. In addition, instances of food or beverage-safety issues, even those involving solely the restaurants or stores of competitors or of suppliers or distributors (regardless of whether we use or have used those suppliers or distributors), could, by resulting in negative publicity about us or the foodservice industry in general, adversely affect our sales on a regional or global basis. A decrease in customer traffic as a result of food-safety concerns or negative publicity, or as a result of a temporary closure of any of our stores, product recalls or food or beverage-safety claims or litigation, could materially harm our business and results of operations. • The unauthorized access, use, theft or destruction of customer or employee personal, financial or other data or of Starbucks proprietary or confidential information that is stored in our information systems or by third parties on our behalf could impact our reputation and brand and expose us to potential liability and loss of revenues. Many of our information technology systems (and those of our licensees and other third-party business partners, whether cloud-based or hosted in proprietary servers), including those used for our point-of-sale, web and mobile platforms, online and mobile payment systems, delivery services and rewards programs, and administrative functions, contain personal, financial or other information that is entrusted to us by our customers and employees. Many of our information technology systems also contain Starbucks proprietary and other confidential information related to our business, such as business plans, product development initiatives and designs. Similar to many other retail companies and because of the prominence of our brand, we are consistently subject to attempts to compromise our information technology systems. To the extent we or a third party were to experience a material breach of our or such third parties' information technology systems that result in the unauthorized access, theft, use, destruction or other compromises of customers' or employees' data or confidential information of the Company stored in such systems, including through cyber-attacks or other external or internal methods, it could result in a material loss of revenues from the potential adverse impact to our reputation and brand, our ability to retain or attract new customers and the potential disruption to our business and plans. Such security breaches also could result in a violation of applicable U.S. and international privacy and other laws, and subject us to private consumer, business partner, or securities litigation and governmental investigations and proceedings, any of which could result in our exposure to material civil or criminal liability. For example, 10 Table of Contents the European Union adopted a new regulation that became effective in May 2018, called the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which requires companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data, including its use, protection and transfer and the ability of persons whose data is stored to correct or delete such data about themselves. Failure to meet the GDPR requirements could result in penalties of up to 4% of annual worldwide revenue. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on certain individuals and associations. Additionally, the California Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), which was enacted in June 2018 and will come into effect on January 1, 2020, provides a new private right of action for data breaches and requires companies that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices and allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties. Our reputation and brand and our ability to attract new customers could also be adversely impacted if we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to properly respond to security breaches of our or third party’s information technology systems. Such failure to properly respond could also result in similar exposure to liability. Compliance with the GDPR, the CCPA and other current and future applicable international and U.S. privacy, cybersecurity and related laws can be costly and time-consuming. Significant capital investments and other expenditures could also be required to remedy cybersecurity problems and prevent future breaches, including costs associated with additional security technologies, personnel, experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached. These costs, which could be material, could adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred and may not meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to breach our information technology systems. Media or other reports of existing or perceived security vulnerabilities in our systems or those of our third-party business partners or service providers can also adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially impact our business. Additionally, the techniques and sophistication used to conduct cyber-attacks and breach information technology systems, as well as the sources and targets of these attacks, change frequently and are often not recognized until such attacks are launched or have been in place for a period of time. We continue to make significant investments in technology, third-party services and personnel to develop and implement systems and processes that are designed to anticipate cyber-attacks and to prevent or minimize breaches of our information technology systems or data loss, but these security measures cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in preventing such breaches or data loss. • We rely heavily on information technology in our operations and growth initiatives, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption or security failure of that technology could harm our ability to effectively operate and grow our business and could adversely affect our financial results. We rely heavily on information technology systems across our operations for numerous purposes including for administrative functions, point-of-sale processing and payment in our stores and online, management of our supply chain, Starbucks Cards, online business, delivery services, mobile technology, including mobile payments and ordering apps, reloads and loyalty functionality and various other processes and transactions, and many of these systems are interdependent on one another for their functionality. Additionally, the success of several of our initiatives to drive growth, including our ability to increase digital relationships with our customers to drive incremental traffic and spend, is highly dependent on our technology systems. We also rely on third-party providers and platforms for some of these information technology systems and support. Additionally, our systems hardware, software and services provided by third-party service providers are not fully redundant within a market or across our markets. Although we have operational safeguards in place, they may not be effective in preventing the failure of these systems or platforms to operate effectively and be available. Such failures may be caused by various factors, including power outages, catastrophic events, physical theft, computer and network failures, inadequate or ineffective redundancy, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems or platforms, flaws in third-party software or services, errors or improper use by our employees or third party service providers, or a breach in the security of these systems or platforms, including through cyber-attacks such as those that result in the blockage of our or our third-party business partners’ or service providers’ systems and platforms and those discussed in more detail in this risk factors section. If our incident response, disaster recovery and business continuity plans do not resolve these issues in an effective manner they could result in an interruption in our operations and could cause material negative impacts to our product availability and sales, the efficiency of our operations and our financial results. In addition, remediation of any problems with our systems could result in significant, unplanned expenses. • We may not be successful in implementing important strategic initiatives or effectively managing growth, which may have an adverse impact on our business and financial results. There is no assurance that we will be able to implement important strategic initiatives in accordance with our expectations or that they will generate expected returns, which may result in an adverse impact on our business and financial results. These strategic initiatives are designed to create growth, improve our results of operations and drive long-term shareholder value, and include: • being an employer of choice and investing in employees to deliver a superior customer experience; • building our leadership position around coffee; 11 Table of Contents • driving convenience, brand engagement and digital relationships through our mobile, loyalty, delivery and digital capabilities both domestically and internationally; • simplifying store administrative tasks to allow store partners to better engage with customers; • increasing the scale of the Starbucks store footprint with disciplined global expansion and introducing flexible and unique store formats; • moving to a more licensed store model in some markets and a more company-owned model in other markets; • creating new occasions in stores across all dayparts with new product offerings, including our growing lunch food and beverage product lineup; • continuing the global growth of our Channel Development business through our supply, distribution and licensing agreements with Nestlé and other Channel Development business partners; • delivering continued growth in our cold beverage business, including our tea business through the Teavana brand in our Starbucks ® retail stores and other channels and internationally; and • reducing our operating costs, particularly general and administrative expenses. In addition to other factors listed in this risk factors section, factors that may adversely affect the successful implementation of these initiatives, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results, include the following: • imposition of additional taxes by jurisdictions, such as on certain types of beverages or based on number of employees; • construction cost increases associated with new store openings and remodeling of existing stores; delays in store openings for reasons beyond our control or a lack of desirable real estate locations available for lease at reasonable rates, either of which could keep us from meeting annual store opening targets in the U.S. and internationally; • not successfully scaling our supply chain infrastructure as our product offerings increase and as we continue to expand, including our emphasis on a broad range of high-quality food offerings; and • the deterioration in our credit ratings, which could limit the availability of additional financing and increase the cost of obtaining financing to fund our initiatives. Effectively managing growth can be challenging, particularly as we expand into new markets internationally where we must balance the need for flexibility and a degree of autonomy for local management against the need for consistency with our goals, philosophy and standards. If we are not successful in implementing our strategic initiatives, such as large acquisitions and integrations, we may be required to evaluate whether certain assets, including goodwill and other intangibles, have become impaired. In the event we record an impairment charge, it could have a material impact on our financial results. • Evolving consumer preferences and tastes may adversely affect our business. Our continued success depends on our ability to retain and convert customers. Our financial results could be adversely affected by a shift in consumer spending away from outside-the-home food and beverages (such as the disruption caused by on-line commerce that results in reduced foot traffic to ""brick & mortar"" retail stores); lack of customer acceptance of new products (including due to price increases necessary to cover the costs of new products or higher input costs), brands (such as the global expansion of the Teavana brand in our Starbucks ® retail stores and other channels) and platforms (such as features of our mobile technology, changes in our loyalty rewards programs and our delivery services initiatives); or customers reducing their demand for our current offerings as new products are introduced. In addition, some of our products contain caffeine, dairy products, sugar and other compounds and allergens, the health effects of which are the subject of public and regulatory scrutiny, including the suggestion of linkages to a variety of adverse health effects. Particularly in the U.S., there is increasing consumer awareness of health risks, including obesity, as well as increased consumer litigation based on alleged adverse health impacts of consumption of various food and beverage products. While we have a variety of beverage and food items, including items that are coffee-free and have reduced calories, an unfavorable report on the health effects of caffeine or other compounds present in our products, whether accurate or not, imposition of additional taxes on certain types of food and beverage components, or negative publicity or litigation arising from certain health risks could significantly reduce the demand for our beverages and food products and could materially harm our business and results of operations. • Our reliance on key business partners may adversely affect our business and operations. The growth of our business relies on the ability of our licensee partners to implement our growth platforms and product innovations as well as on the degree to which we are able to enter into, maintain, develop and negotiate appropriate terms and conditions of, and enforce, commercial and other agreements and the performance of our business partners under such agreements. Our international joint venture partners or licensees may face capital constraints or other factors that may limit the 12 Table of Contents speed at which they are able to expand and develop in a certain market. Our Channel Development business is heavily reliant on Nestlé, which acquired the right to sell and distribute our packaged goods and foodservice products to retailers and operators, with few exceptions. If Nestlé fails to perform its distribution and marketing commitments under our agreements and/or fails to support, protect and grow our brand in Channel Development, our Channel Development business could be adversely impacted for a period of time, present long-term challenges to our brand, limit our ability to grow our Channel Development business and have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results. Additionally, the growth of our Channel Development business is in part dependent on the level of discretionary support provided by our retail and licensed store businesses. There are generally a relatively small number of licensee partners operating in specific markets. If they are not able to access sufficient funds or financing, or are otherwise unable to successfully operate and grow their businesses it could have a material adverse effect on our results in the markets. • Changes in the availability of and the cost of labor could adversely affect our business. Increases in labor costs, including wages and benefits, which, in a retail business such as ours, are two of our most significant costs, both domestically and internationally, including those increases triggered by regulatory actions regarding wages, scheduling and benefits; increased health care and workers’ compensation insurance costs and increased wages and costs of other benefits necessary to attract and retain high quality employees with the right skill sets. Furthermore, the growth of our business can make it increasingly difficult to locate and hire sufficient numbers of key employees, to maintain an effective system of internal controls for a globally dispersed enterprise and to train employees worldwide to deliver a consistently high-quality product and customer experience which could materially harm our business and results of operations. • We face intense competition in each of our channels and markets, which could lead to reduced profitability. The specialty coffee market is intensely competitive, including with respect to product quality, innovation, service, convenience, such as delivery service and mobile ordering, and price, and we face significant and increasing competition in all these areas in each of our channels and markets. Accordingly, we do not have leadership positions in all channels and markets. In the U.S., the ongoing focus by large competitors in the quick-service restaurant sector on selling high-quality specialty coffee beverages could lead to decreases in customer traffic to Starbucks ® stores and/or average value per transaction adversely affecting our sales and results of operations. Similarly, continued competition from well-established competitors, or competition from large new entrants or well-funded smaller companies in our domestic and international markets could hinder growth and adversely affect our sales and results of operations in those markets. Many small competitors also continue to open coffee specialty stores in many of our markets across the world, which in the aggregate may also lead to significant decreases of customer traffic to our stores in those markets. Increased competition globally in packaged coffee and tea and single-serve and ready-to-drink coffee beverage markets, including from new and large entrants to this market, could adversely affect the profitability of the Channel Development segment. Furthermore, declines in general consumer demand for specialty coffee products for any reason, including due to consumer preference for other products or flattening demand for our products, could have a negative effect on our business. • We are highly dependent on the financial performance of our Americas operating segment. Our financial performance is highly dependent on our Americas operating segment, as it comprised approximately 69% of consolidated total net revenues in fiscal 2019 . If the Americas operating segment revenue trends slow or decline, especially in our U.S. market, our other segments may be unable to make up any significant shortfall and our business and financial results could be adversely affected. And because the Americas segment is relatively mature and produces the large majority of our operating cash flows, such a slowdown or decline could result in reduced cash flows for funding the expansion of our international businesses and other initiatives and for returning cash to shareholders. • We are increasingly dependent on the success of certain international markets in order to achieve our growth targets. Our future growth increasingly depends on the growth and sustained profitability of certain international markets. Some or all of our international market business units (“MBUs”), which we generally define by the countries in which they operate, may not be successful in their operations or in achieving expected growth, which ultimately requires achieving consistent, stable net revenues and earnings. The performance of these international operations may be adversely affected by economic downturns in one or more of the countries in which our large MBUs operate. A decline in performance of one or more of our significant international MBUs could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results. The International segment is a significant profit center driving our global returns, along with our Americas segment. In particular, our China MBU contributes meaningfully to both consolidated and International net revenues and operating income. China is currently our fastest growing market and second largest market overall. With our acquisition of the East China business, the China market is 100% company-owned. Due to the significance of our China market for our profit and growth, we are exposed to risks in China, including the risks mentioned elsewhere and the following: 13 Table of Contents • the effects of current U.S.-China relations, including rounds of tariff increases and retaliations and increasing restrictive regulations, potential boycotts and increasing anti-Americanism; • entry of new competitors to the specialty coffee market in China; • changes in economic conditions in China and potential negative effects to the growth of its middle class, wages, labor, inflation discretionary spending and real estate and supply chain costs; • ongoing government regulatory reform, including relating to food safety, tariffs and tax, bringing uncertainty and inconsistent interpretations, which may be contrary to ours, as well as potential significant increases in compliance costs; • food-safety related matters, including compliance with food-safety regulations and ability to ensure product quality and safety; and • the ability to successfully integrate the East China business. Additionally, some factors that will be critical to the success of our international operations overall are different than those affecting our U.S. stores and licensees. Tastes naturally vary by region, and consumers in some MBUs may not embrace our products to the same extent as consumers in the U.S. or other international markets. Occupancy costs and store operating expenses can be higher internationally than in the U.S. due to higher rents for prime store locations or costs of compliance with country-specific regulatory requirements. Because many of our international operations are in an early phase of development, operating expenses as a percentage of related revenues are often higher compared to more developed operations. • We face risks as a global business that could adversely affect our financial performance. We operate in over 80 markets globally. Our international operations are also subject to additional inherent risks of conducting business abroad, such as: • foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, or requirements to transact in specific currencies; • changes or uncertainties in economic, legal, regulatory, social and political conditions in our markets, as well as negative effects on U.S. businesses due to increasing anti-American sentiment in certain markets; • interpretation and application of laws and regulations, including tax, tariffs, labor, merchandise, anti-bribery and privacy laws and regulations; • uncertainties and effects of the implementation of the United Kingdom's referendum to withdraw membership from the European Union (referred to as “Brexit”), including financial, legal, tax and trade implications; • restrictive actions of foreign or U.S. governmental authorities affecting trade and foreign investment, especially during periods of heightened tension between the U.S. and such foreign governmental authorities, including protective measures such as export and customs duties and tariffs, government intervention favoring local competitors, and restrictions on the level of foreign ownership; • import or other business licensing requirements; • the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights; • limitations on the repatriation of funds and foreign currency exchange restrictions due to current or new U.S. and international regulations; • in developing economies, the growth rate in the portion of the population achieving sufficient levels of disposable income may not be as fast as we forecast; • difficulty in staffing, developing and managing foreign operations and supply chain logistics, including ensuring the consistency of product quality and service, due to governmental actions affecting supply chain logistics, distance, language and cultural differences, as well as challenges in recruiting and retaining high quality employees in local markets; • local laws that make it more expensive and complex to negotiate with, retain or terminate employees; and • delays in store openings for reasons beyond our control, competition with locally relevant competitors or a lack of desirable real estate locations available for lease at reasonable rates, any of which could keep us from meeting annual store opening targets and, in turn, negatively impact net revenues, operating income and earnings per share. Moreover, many of the foregoing risks are particularly acute in developing countries, which are important to our long-term growth prospects. 14 Table of Contents • Increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities or decreases in the availability of high-quality arabica coffee beans or other commodities could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results. The availability and prices of coffee beans and other commodities are subject to significant volatility. We purchase, roast and sell high-quality whole bean arabica coffee beans and related coffee products. The high-quality arabica coffee of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a premium above the “C” price. This premium depends upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and the amount of the premium can vary significantly. Increases in the “C” coffee commodity price increase the price of high-quality arabica coffee and also impact our ability to enter into fixed-price purchase commitments. We frequently enter into supply contracts whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period, and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore price, at which the base “C” coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established. The supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, such as weather (including the potential effects of climate change), natural disasters, crop disease, general increase in farm inputs and costs of production, inventory levels, political and economic conditions, and the actions of certain organizations and associations that have historically attempted to influence prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or by restricting coffee supplies. Speculative trading in coffee commodities can also influence coffee prices. Because of the significance of coffee beans to our operations, combined with our ability to only partially mitigate future price risk through purchasing practices and hedging activities, increases in the cost of high-quality arabica coffee beans could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. In addition, if we are not able to purchase sufficient quantities of green coffee due to any of the above factors or to a worldwide or regional shortage, we may not be able to fulfill the demand for our coffee, which could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. We also purchase significant amounts of dairy products, particularly fluid milk, to support the needs of our company-operated retail stores. Additionally, and although less significant to our operations than coffee or dairy, other commodities, including but not limited to tea and those related to food and beverage inputs, such as cocoa, produce, baking ingredients, meats, eggs and energy, as well as the processing of these inputs, are important to our operations. Increases in the cost of dairy products and other commodities, or lack of availability, whether due to supply shortages, delays or interruptions in processing, or otherwise, especially in international markets, could have a material adverse impact on our profitability. • Our financial condition and results of operations are sensitive to, and may be adversely affected by, a number of factors, many of which are largely outside our control. Our operating results have been in the past and will continue to be subject to a number of factors, many of which are largely outside our control. Any one or more of the factors listed below or described elsewhere in this risk factors section could have a material adverse impact our business, financial condition and/or results of operations: • increases in real estate costs in certain domestic and international markets; • adverse outcomes of litigation; • severe weather or other natural or man-made disasters affecting a large market or several closely located markets that may temporarily but significantly affect our retail business in such markets; • especially in our large markets, labor discord or disruption, geopolitical events, war, terrorism (including incidents targeting us), political instability, acts of public violence, boycotts, increasing anti-American sentiment in certain markets, social unrest, and health pandemics that lead to avoidance of public places or restrictions on public gatherings such as in our stores; and • the discontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) after 2021 and the replacement with an alternative reference rate may adversely impact interest rates. • Interruption of our supply chain could affect our ability to produce or deliver our products and could negatively impact our business and profitability. Any material interruption in our supply chain, such as material interruption of roasted coffee supply due to the casualty loss of any of our roasting plants, interruptions in service by our third party logistic service providers or common carriers that ship goods within our distribution channels, trade restrictions, such as increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes or customs restrictions, natural disasters or political disputes and military conflicts that cause a material disruption in our supply chain could have a negative material impact on our business and our profitability. Additionally, our food, beverage and other products are sourced from a wide variety of domestic and international business partners in our supply chain operations, and in certain cases are produced or sourced by our licensees directly. We rely on these suppliers to provide high quality products and to comply with applicable laws. Our ability to find qualified suppliers who meet our standards and supply products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge as we increase our fresh and 15 Table of Contents prepared food offerings, especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the U.S. and from countries or regions with diminished infrastructure, developing or failing economies or which are experiencing political instability or social unrest. For certain products, we may rely on one or very few suppliers. A supplier's failure to meet our standards, provide products in a timely and efficient manner, or comply with applicable laws is beyond our control. These issues could have a material negative impact on our business and profitability. • Failure to meet market expectations for our financial performance and fluctuations in the stock market as a whole will likely adversely affect the market price and volatility of our stock. Failure to meet market expectations going forward, particularly with respect to operating margins, earnings per share, comparable store sales growth, operating cash flows, shareholder returns and net revenues, will likely result in a decline and/or increased volatility in the market price of our stock. In addition, price and volume fluctuations in the stock market as a whole may affect the market price of our stock in ways that may be unrelated to our financial performance. • The loss of key personnel or difficulties recruiting and retaining qualified personnel could adversely impact our business and financial results. Much of our future success depends on the continued availability and service of senior management personnel. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key senior management personnel could harm our business. Our success also depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of our retail store employees on whom we rely to give customers a superior in-store experience and elevate our brand. Accordingly, our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain high quality management personnel and other employees to work in and manage our stores, both domestically and internationally. Our ability to attract and retain both corporate and retail personnel is also acutely impacted in certain international and domestic markets where the competition for a relatively small number of qualified employees is intense or in markets where large high-tech companies are able to offer more competitive salaries and benefits. Additionally, there is intense competition for qualified technology systems developers necessary to develop and implement new technologies for our growth initiatives, including increasing our digital relationships with customers. If we are unable to recruit, retain and motivate employees sufficiently to maintain our current business and support our projected growth, our business and financial performance may be adversely affected. • Failure to comply with applicable laws and changing legal and regulatory requirements could harm our business and financial results. Our policies and procedures are designed to comply with all applicable laws, accounting and reporting requirements, tax rules and other regulations and requirements, including those imposed by the SEC, Nasdaq, and foreign countries, as well as applicable trade, labor, healthcare, food and beverage, sanitation, safety, environmental, labeling, anti-bribery and corruption and merchandise laws. Changes in applicable environmental regulations, including increased or additional regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, to discourage the use of plastic or to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use, may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures, incremental investments, and other financial obligations for us and our business partners, which could affect our profitability. In addition, our business is subject to complex and rapidly evolving U.S. and international laws and regulations regarding data privacy and data protection, and companies are under increased regulatory scrutiny relating to these matters. The Federal Trade Commission and many state attorneys general are also interpreting federal and state consumer protection laws to impose standards for the online collection, use, dissemination and security of data. The interpretation and application of existing laws and regulations regarding data privacy and data protection are in flux and authorities around the world are considering a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals in this area. Current and future data privacy and data protection laws and regulations (including the GDPR and the CCPA, discussed in more detail in this risk factors section, and other applicable international and U.S. privacy laws), or new interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may limit our ability to collect and use data, require us to otherwise modify our data processing practices and policies or result in the possibility of fines, litigation or orders, which may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. The burdens imposed by these and other laws and regulations that may be enacted, or new interpretations of existing and future laws and regulations, may also require us to incur substantial costs in reaching compliance in a manner adverse to our business. In addition, the European Commission in July 2016 and the Swiss Government in January 2017 approved the EU-U.S. and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield frameworks, respectively, which are designed to allow U.S. companies that self-certify to the U.S. Department of Commerce and publicly commit to comply with the Privacy Shield requirements to freely import personal data from the EU and Switzerland. However, these frameworks face a number of legal challenges and their validity remains subject to legal, regulatory and political developments in both Europe and the U.S. The EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework approved by the European Commission which is relied upon for transfers of personal data outside the European Economic Area could be invalidated by the Court of Justice of the European Union. The potential invalidation of this mechanism could have a significant adverse impact on our ability to process and transfer personal data outside of the European Economic Area. 16 Table of Contents The complexity of the regulatory environment in which we operate and the related cost of compliance are both increasing due to additional or changing legal and regulatory requirements, our ongoing expansion into new markets and new channels, and the fact that foreign laws occasionally conflict with domestic laws. In addition to potential damage to our reputation and brand, failure by us or our business partners to comply with the various applicable laws and regulations, as well as changes in laws and regulations or the manner in which they are interpreted or applied, may result in litigation, civil and criminal liability, damages, fines and penalties, increased cost of regulatory compliance and restatements of our financial statements and have an adverse impact on our business and financial results.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. All references to store counts, including data for new store openings, are reported net of related store closures, unless otherwise noted. Overview Starbucks results for fiscal 2019 reflect the impacts of continued streamlining efforts, initiated during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, to focus on accelerating growth in high-returning businesses and converting several market operations, including Thailand, France, and the Netherlands, to fully licensed models in fiscal 2019. Additionally, in fiscal 2019, we saw the full impact from the licensing of the majority of our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestlé in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we realigned our operating segment reporting structure to better reflect the cumulative effect of our streamlining efforts. Specifically, our previous China/Asia Pacific (""CAP"") segment and Europe, Middle East, and Africa (""EMEA"") segment have been combined into one International segment. Results of Siren Retail, a non-reportable operating segment consisting of Starbucks Reserve TM Roastery & Tasting Rooms, certain stores under the Starbucks Reserve brand and Princi operations, which were previously included within Corporate and Other, are now reported within the Americas and International segments based on the geographical location of the operations. As a result, we have three reportable operating segments: Americas, International and Channel Development. Non-reportable operating segments and unallocated corporate expenses are reported within Corporate and Other. Further, to better support the review of our results, we have changed the classification of certain costs. The most significant change was the reclassification of company-owned store occupancy costs from cost of sales to store operating expenses. We also made certain other immaterial changes. Concurrent with the change in reportable segments and realignment of certain operating expenses noted above, we revised our prior period financial information to be consistent with the current period presentation. There was no impact on consolidated net revenues, total operating expenses, operating income, or net earnings per share as a result of these changes. In December 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation into law H.R. 1, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), which significantly changed existing U.S. tax law and included numerous provisions that affect our business. Our U.S. corporate income tax rate for fiscal 2019 and future years is 21%, while a blended rate of 24.5% was applied in fiscal 2018. Financial Highlights • Total net revenues increased 7% to $26.5 billion in fiscal 2019 compared to $24.7 billion in fiscal 2018 . • Consolidated operating income increased to $4.1 billion in fiscal 2019 compared to operating income of $3.9 billion in fiscal 2018 . Fiscal 2019 operating margin was 15.4% compared to 15.7% in fiscal 2018 . Operating margin compression in fiscal 2019 was primarily driven by partner (employee) investments and growth in wages and benefits, licensing our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestlé and other strategic investments. These decreases were partially offset by sales leverage, cost savings initiatives, lower restructuring and impairment costs and the impact of the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance on stored value card breakage. • Earnings per share (“EPS”) for fiscal 2019 decreased to $2.92 , compared to EPS of $3.24 in fiscal 2018 . The decrease was primarily driven by lapping the prior year gains from the acquisition of our East China joint venture and the sale of our Tazo brand, partially offset by the gain from the sale of our Thailand retail operations during fiscal 2019. • Capital expenditures were $1.8 billion in fiscal 2019 compared to $2.0 billion in fiscal 2018 . • We returned $12.0 billion to our shareholders in fiscal 2019 through share repurchases and dividends compared to $8.9 billion in fiscal 2018 . Acquisitions and Divestitures See Note 2 , Acquisitions, Divestitures and Strategic Alliance, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for information regarding acquisitions and divestitures. 23 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — FISCAL 2019 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2018 Consolidated results of operations (in millions) : Revenues Fiscal Year Ended Sep 29, 2019 Sep 30, 2018 % Change Net revenues: Company-operated stores $ 21,544.4 $ 19,690.3 9.4 % Licensed stores 2,875.0 2,652.2 8.4 Other 2,089.2 2,377.0 (12.1 ) Total net revenues $ 26,508.6 $ 24,719.5 7.2 % Total net revenues increased $1.8 billion , or 7% , over fiscal 2018 , primarily driven by higher revenues from company-operated stores ( $1.9 billion ). The growth in company-operated store revenues was driven by incremental revenues from 947 net new Starbucks ® company-operated store openings over the past 12 months ($957 million) and a 5% increase in comparable store sales ($879 million), attributable to a 3% increase in average ticket and a 2% increase in comparable transactions. These increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation ($189 million) and the conversion of our Thailand, France, and the Netherlands retail businesses to fully licensed markets during fiscal 2019 ($161 million). Licensed store revenue growth also contributed to the increase in total net revenues ( $223 million ), primarily due to higher product and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($228 million), largely due to the opening of 992 net new Starbucks ® licensed stores over the past 12 months, and the conversion of our Thailand, France, and the Netherlands retail businesses to fully licensed markets ($35 million), partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation ($41 million). Other revenues decreased $288 million , primarily driven by the licensing of our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestlé. Partially offsetting this decrease was growth in product revenue, primarily premium single-serve products, in connection with the Global Coffee Alliance.

Store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 130 basis points. Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues increased 60 basis points, primarily driven by investments in our store partners that are funded by savings from the Tax Act and growth in wages and benefits (approximately 120 basis points), largely in the Americas segment, partially offset by sales leverage driven by price increases and the impact of the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance on stored value card breakage. 24 Table of Contents Other operating expenses decreased $184 million, primarily due to cost savings related to licensing our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestlé ($176 million) and lapping prior year costs associated with the establishment of the Global Coffee Alliance ($34 million), including business taxes associated with the up-front prepaid royalty from Nestlé and headcount-related costs, primarily relating to employee bonus and retention costs. Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 20 basis points, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in East China (approximately 20 basis points). General and administrative expenses increased $116 million, primarily driven by higher performance-based compensation ($89 million) and the 2019 Starbucks Leadership Experience in Chicago, heavily concentrated in our fiscal fourth quarter ($52 million). Restructuring and impairment expenses decreased $89 million, primarily due to lower restructuring and impairment costs related to Teavana TM/MC retail store closures ($128 million) and lower impairments related to our Switzerland retail market ($27 million), partially offset by higher exit costs associated with the closure of certain Starbucks ® company-operated stores ($32 million) and severance costs ($25 million). Income from equity investees decreased $3 million, primarily due to the impact of our ownership changes in East China. This decrease was partially offset by improved comparable store sales from our joint venture in South Korea and higher income from our North American Coffee Partnership joint venture. The combination of these changes resulted in an overall decrease in operating margin of 30 basis points in fiscal 2019 when compared to fiscal 2018 . Other Income and Expenses Fiscal Year Ended Sep 29, 2019 Sep 30, 2018 Sep 29, 2019 Sep 30, 2018 As a % of Total Net Revenues Operating income $ 4,077.9 $ 3,883.3 15.4 % 15.7 % Gain resulting from acquisition of joint venture — 1,376.4 — 5.6 Net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations 622.8 499.2 2.3 2.0 Interest income and other, net 96.5 191.4 0.4 0.8 Interest expense (331.0 ) (170.3 ) (1.2 ) (0.7 ) Earnings before income taxes 4,466.2 5,780.0 16.8 23.4 Income tax expense 871.6 1,262.0 3.3 5.1 Net earnings including noncontrolling interests 3,594.6 4,518.0 13.6 18.3 Net earnings/(loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests (4.6 ) (0.3 ) — — Net earnings attributable to Starbucks $ 3,599.2 $ 4,518.3 13.6 % 18.3 % Effective tax rate including noncontrolling interests 19.5 % 21.8 % Gain resulting from acquisition of joint venture in fiscal 2018 was due to remeasuring our preexisting 50% ownership interest in our East China joint venture to fair value upon acquisition. Net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations was primarily due to the sale of our Thailand, France and the Netherlands retail operations in fiscal 2019. The gain in fiscal 2018 was primarily due to the sale of our Tazo brand and Taiwan joint venture, partially offset by the net loss from the sale of our Brazil retail operations in fiscal 2018. Interest income and other, net decreased $95 million , primarily due to the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance on a prospective basis, which required estimated breakage on unredeemed store value cards to be recorded as revenue. We recorded store value card breakage in interest income and other, net in the prior year. Interest expense increased $161 million primarily due to additional interest incurred on long-term debt issued in November 2017, March 2018, August 2018 and May 2019. 25 Table of Contents The effective tax rate for fiscal 2019 was 19.5% compared to 21.8% for fiscal 2018 . The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the lower corporate tax rate as a result of the Tax Act (approximately 350 basis points), lapping prior year's transition tax on our accumulated undistributed foreign earnings and remeasurement of our deferred tax liabilities (approximately 300 basis points), higher stock-based compensation excess tax benefit (approximately 140 basis points), the release of income tax reserves related to the settlement of a U.S. tax examination and the expiration of statute of limitations (approximately 130 basis points) and the tax impacts of the gain on the sale of our Thailand retail operations (approximately 130 basis points). These favorable impacts were partially offset by the lapping of prior year's gain on the purchase of our East China joint venture that was not subject to income tax (approximately 580 basis points) and the impact of changes in indefinite reinvestment assertions for certain foreign subsidiaries during the first quarter of fiscal 2019 (approximately 170 basis points). See Note 13 , Income Taxes, for further discussion. 26 Table of Contents Segment Information Results of operations by segment (in millions) : Americas Fiscal Year Ended Sep 29, 2019 Sep 30, 2018 Sep 29, 2019 Sep 30, 2018 As a % of Americas Total Net Revenues Net revenues: Company-operated stores $ 16,288.2 $ 14,921.5 89.2 % 89.1 % Licensed stores 1,958.0 1,814.0 10.7 10.8 Other 12.8 13.1 0.1 0.1 Total net revenues 18,259.0 16,748.6 100.0 100.0 Cost of sales 5,174.7 4,884.1 28.3 29.2 Store operating expenses 8,064.8 7,248.6 44.2 43.3 Other operating expenses 159.8 151.2 0.9 0.9 Depreciation and amortization expenses 696.1 641.0 3.8 3.8 General and administrative expenses 323.9 305.1 1.8 1.8 Restructuring and impairments 56.9 33.4 0.3 0.2 Total operating expenses 14,476.2 13,263.4 79.3 79.2 Operating income $ 3,782.8 $ 3,485.2 20.7 % 20.8 % Revenues Americas total net revenues for fiscal 2019 increased $1.5 billion, or 9%, primarily driven by a 5% increase in comparable store sales ($744 million) and 282 net new Starbucks ® company-operated stores, or a 3% increase, over the past 12 months ($580 million). Also contributing were higher product sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($144 million), primarily resulting from comparable store sales growth and the opening of 323 net new Starbucks® licensed stores, or 4% increase, over the past 12 months and the impact of the adoption of revenue recognition guidance on stored value card breakage ($119 million). Operating Margin Americas operating income for fiscal 2019 increased 9% to $3.8 billion , compared to $3.5 billion in fiscal 2018 . Operating margin decreased 10 basis points to 20.7% , primarily driven by higher partner investments, largely funded by savings from the Tax Act, growth in wages and benefits (approximately 130 basis points) and to a much lesser extent, investments in labor hours heavily concentrated in our fiscal fourth quarter. Partially offsetting these were cost savings initiatives, primarily in cost of sales (approximately 90 basis points), the impact of the adoption of revenue recognition guidance on stored value card breakage (approximately 50 basis points) and sales leverage. 27 Table of Contents International Fiscal Year Ended Sep 29, 2019 Sep 30, 2018 Sep 29, 2019 Sep 30, 2018 As a % of International Total Net Revenues Net revenues: Company-operated stores $ 5,256.2 $ 4,702.1 84.9 % 84.7 % Licensed stores 917.0 837.0 14.8 15.1 Other 17.5 12.1 0.3 0.2 Total net revenues 6,190.7 5,551.2 100.0 100.0 Cost of sales 1,894.9 1,709.4 30.6 30.8 Store operating expenses 2,428.5 2,182.3 39.2 39.3 Other operating expenses 116.4 98.9 1.9 1.8 Depreciation and amortization expenses 511.5 447.6 8.3 8.1 General and administrative expenses 317.9 302.5 5.1 5.4 Restructuring and impairments 59.2 55.1 1.0 1.0 Total operating expenses 5,328.4 4,795.8 86.1 86.4 Income from equity investees 102.4 117.4 1.7 2.1 Operating income $ 964.7 $ 872.8 15.6 % 15.7 % Discussion of our International segment results below reflects the impact of fully consolidating our East China business from an equity method joint venture to a company-operated market since the acquisition date of December 31, 2017. Under the joint venture model, we recognized royalties and product sales within revenue and related product cost of sales as well as our proportionate share of East China's net earnings, which resulted in a higher margin business. Under the company-operated ownership model, East China’s operating results are reflected in most income statement lines of this segment. Re venues International total net revenues for fiscal 2019 increased $640 million, or 12%, primarily driven by 665 net new Starbucks ® company-operated stores, or a 12% increase, over the past 12 months ($377 million), the ownership change in East China ($280 million) and a 3% increase in comparable store sales ($135 million). Also contributing were increased product sales to and royalty revenues from licensees ($84 million), primarily resulting from opening of 669 net new Starbucks ® licensed stores, or an 11% increase, over the past 12 months and the impact of the adoption of revenue recognition guidance on stored value card breakage ($20 million). These increases were partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency translation ($183 million) and the conversion of our Thailand, France, and the Netherlands retail businesses to fully licensed markets ($126 million). Operating Margin International operating income for fiscal 2019 increased 11% to $965 million , compared to $873 million in fiscal 2018 . Operating margin decreased 10 basis points to 15.6% , primarily driven by strategic investments to support growth in China (approximately 80 basis points) and growth in wages and benefits (approximately 70 basis points), primarily offset by cost savings initiatives (approximately 80 basis points) and labor efficiencies (approximately 70 basis points). 28 Table of Contents Channel Development Fiscal Year Ended Sep 29, 2019 Sep 30, 2018 Sep 29, 2019 Sep 30, 2018 As a % of Channel Development Total Net Revenues Net revenues $ 1,992.6 $ 2,297.3 Cost of sales 1,390.0 1,252.3 69.8 54.5 Other operating expenses 76.2 286.5 3.8 12.5 Depreciation and amortization expenses 13.0 1.3 0.7 0.1 General and administrative expenses 11.5 13.9 0.6 0.6 Total operating expenses 1,490.7 1,554.0 74.8 67.6 Income from equity investees 195.6 183.8 9.8 8.0 Operating income $ 697.5 $ 927.1 35.0 % 40.4 % Our Channel Development segment results reflect the impact of the licensing of our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestlé late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, which we lapped late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019. Our collaborative business relationships for our global ready-to-drink products and the associated revenues remain unchanged due to the Global Coffee Alliance. Revenues Channel Development net revenues for fiscal 2019 decreased $305 million , or 13% , when compared to the prior year period, primarily driven by licensing our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestlé ($329 million), offset by growth in product revenue, primarily premium single-serve products, in connection with our Global Coffee Alliance ($25 million). Operating Margin Channel Development operating income for fiscal 2019 decreased 25% to $698 million , compared to $927 million in fiscal 2018 . Operating margin decreased 540 basis points to 35.0% , primarily driven by licensing our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestlé (approximately 640 basis points), partially offset by lapping prior year costs associated with the establishment of the Global Coffee Alliance (approximately 140 basis points), including business taxes associated with the up-front prepaid royalty and headcount-related costs, primarily related to employee bonus and retention costs. 29 Table of Contents Corporate and Other Fiscal Year Ended Sep 29, 2019 Sep 30, 2018 % Change Net revenues: Company-operated stores $ — $ 66.7 (100.0 )% Licensed stores — 1.2 (100.0 ) Other 66.3 54.5 21.7 Total net revenues 66.3 122.4 (45.8 ) Cost of sales 67.3 84.9 (20.7 ) Store operating expenses 0.3 41.3 (99.3 ) Other operating expenses 18.6 18.3 1.6 Depreciation and amortization expenses 156.7 157.1 (0.3 ) General and administrative expenses 1,170.8 1,086.7 7.7 Restructuring and impairments 19.7 135.9 (85.5 ) Total operating expenses 1,433.4 1,524.2 (6.0 ) Operating loss $ (1,367.1 ) $ (1,401.8 ) (2.5 )% Corporate and Other primarily consists of our unallocated corporate expenses, as well as Evolution Fresh and the legacy operations of the Teavana retail business, which substantially ceased during fiscal 2018.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS — FISCAL 2018 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2017 Consolidated results of operations (in millions) : Revenues Fiscal Year Ended Sep 30, 2018 Oct 1, 2017 % Change Net revenues: Company-operated stores $ 19,690.3 $ 17,650.7 11.6 % Licensed stores 2,652.2 2,355.0 12.6 Other 2,377.0 2,381.1 (0.2 ) Total net revenues $ 24,719.5 $ 22,386.8 10.4 % Total net revenues increased $2.3 billion, or 10%, over fiscal 2017, primarily driven by increased revenues from company-operated stores ($2.0 billion). The growth in company-operated store revenues was driven by incremental revenues from 816 net new Starbucks® company-operated store openings over the past 12 months ($904 million), incremental revenues from the impact of our ownership change in East China ($903 million) and a 2% increase in comparable store sales ($345 million), attributable to a 3% increase in average ticket. Licensed store revenue growth also contributed to the increase in total net revenues ($297 million), primarily due to increased product and equipment sales to and royalty revenues from our licensees ($298 million), largely due to the opening of 1,181 net new Starbucks® licensed stores over the past 12 months and the conversions of both the Singapore and Taiwan markets to fully licensed in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 and the first quarter of fiscal 2018, respectively ($44 million). These increases were partially offset by the impact of our ownership change in East China at the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2018 ($53 million). Other revenues decreased $4 million, primarily driven by the absence of revenue due to the sale of our Tazo brand in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 ($56 million), the closure of our e-commerce business in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 ($51 million) and licensing our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestlé late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 ($50 million). Partially offsetting these decreases were increased sales of packaged coffee and premium single-serve products ($115 million). 30 Table of Contents Operating Expenses Fiscal Year Ended Sep 30, 2018 Oct 1, 2017 Sep 30, 2018 Oct 1, 2017 As a % of Total Net Revenues Cost of sales $ 7,930.7 $ 7,065.8 32.1 % 31.6 % Store operating expenses 9,472.2 8,486.4 38.3 37.9 Other operating expenses 554.9 518.0 2.2 2.3 Depreciation and amortization expenses 1,247.0 1,011.4 5.0 4.5 General and administrative expenses 1,708.2 1,408.4 6.9 6.3 Restructuring and impairments 224.4 153.5 0.9 0.7 Total operating expenses 21,137.4 18,643.5 85.5 83.3 Income from equity investees 301.2 391.4 1.2 1.7 Operating income $ 3,883.3 $ 4,134.7 15.7 % 18.5 % Store operating expenses as a % of related revenues 48.1 % 48.1 % Cost of sales as a percentage of total net revenues increased 50 basis points, primarily due to food and beverage-related mix shifts (approximately 120 basis points), largely in the Americas segment, partially offset by the impact of our ownership change in East China (approximately 40 basis points). Store operating expenses, which include occupancy costs, as a percentage of total net revenues increased 40 basis points. Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues were flat, primarily driven by the impact of our ownership change in East China (approximately 40 basis points), partially offset by increased partner investments, largely in the Americas segment. Other operating expenses increased $37 million, primarily driven by business taxes associated with the up-front payment received from Nestlé. Depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 50 basis points, primarily due to the impact of our ownership change in East China (approximately 60 basis points). General and administrative expenses increased $300 million, primarily due to higher salaries and benefits related to digital platforms, technology infrastructure and innovations and the 2018 U.S. stock award granted in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, which was funded by savings from the Tax Act and vests over one year. Restructuring and impairment expenses increased $71 million, primarily due to higher asset impairments associated with the decision to close certain company-operated stores in the U.S. and Canada ($23 million), higher goodwill impairment charges associated with our Switzerland company-operated retail reporting unit ($20 million) and International restructuring costs, including severance and asset impairments ($18 million). Income from equity investees decreased $90 million, primarily due to the impact of ownership changes in our East China and Taiwan joint ventures, partially offset by higher South Korea joint venture income. The combination of these changes resulted in an overall decrease in operating margin of 280 basis points in fiscal 2018 when compared to fiscal 2017. 31 Table of Contents Other Income and Expenses Fiscal Year Ended Sep 30, 2018 Oct 1, 2017 Sep 30, 2018 Oct 1, 2017 As a % of Total Net Revenues Operating income $ 3,883.3 $ 4,134.7 15.7 % 18.5 % Gain resulting from acquisition of joint venture 1,376.4 — 5.6 — Net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations 499.2 93.5 2.0 0.4 Interest income and other, net 191.4 181.8 0.8 0.8 Interest expense (170.3 ) (92.5 ) (0.7 ) (0.4 ) Earnings before income taxes 5,780.0 4,317.5 23.4 19.3 Income tax expense 1,262.0 1,432.6 5.1 6.4 Net earnings including noncontrolling interests 4,518.0 2,884.9 18.3 12.9 Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (0.3 ) 0.2 — — Net earnings attributable to Starbucks $ 4,518.3 $ 2,884.7 18.3 % 12.9 % Effective tax rate including noncontrolling interests 21.8 % 33.2 % Gain resulting from acquisition of joint venture was due to remeasuring our preexisting 50% ownership interest in our East China joint venture to fair value upon acquisition. Net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations primarily consisted of sales of our Tazo brand and Taiwan joint venture, partially offset by the net loss from the sale of our Brazil retail operations in fiscal 2018. The gain in fiscal 2017 was primarily due to the sale of our Singapore retail operations. Interest income and other, net increased $10 million, primarily due to recognizing higher income on unredeemed stored value card balances, partially offset by the lapping of prior year's gain on the sale of our investment in Square, Inc. warrants in the prior year period. Interest expense increased $78 million primarily related to additional interest incurred on long-term debt issued in November 2017, March 2018 and August 2018. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2018 was 21.8% compared to 33.2% for fiscal 2017. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the gain on the purchase of our East China joint venture that was not subject to income tax (approximately 580 basis points) and the Tax Act (approximately 480 basis points). The impact from the Tax Act primarily included favorability from the lower corporate income tax rate applied to our fiscal 2018 results (approximately 760 basis points) and the remeasurement of our net deferred tax liabilities (approximately 130 basis points). This favorability was partially offset by the estimated transition tax on our accumulated undistributed foreign earnings (approximately 400 basis points).

Our collaborative business relationships for our global ready-to-drink products and the associated revenues remain unchanged due to the Global Coffee Alliance. Revenues Channel Development net revenues for fiscal 2018 increased $41 million, or 2%, over fiscal 2017. Revenue growth was driven by an increase in sales of our packaged coffee and premium single-serve products ($115 million), lapping a prior year revenue deduction adjustment ($13 million) and favorable foreign currency translation ($10 million). These increases were partially offset by the absence of revenue from the sale of our Tazo brand in the first quarter of fiscal 2018 ($56 million) and licensing our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestlé late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 ($50 million). Operating Margin Channel Development operating income for fiscal 2018 decreased 4% to $927.1 million , compared to $967.0 million in fiscal 2017. Operating margin decreased 250 basis points to 40.4% , primarily driven by business taxes associated with the up-front payment received from Nestlé (approximately 120 basis points), Global Coffee Alliance headcount-related costs, including employee bonus and retention costs (approximately 80 basis points), and the impact of our ownership changes, including licensing our CPG and Foodservice businesses to Nestlé and the sale of our Tazo brand. 35 Table of Contents Corporate and Other Fiscal Year Ended Sep 30, 2018 Oct 1, 2017 % Change Net revenues: Company-operated stores $ 66.7 $ 182.4 (63.4 )% Licensed stores 1.2 2.7 (55.6 ) Other 54.5 111.4 (51.1 ) Total net revenues 122.4 296.5 (58.7 ) Cost of sales 84.9 161.3 (47.4 ) Store operating expenses 41.3 148.5 (72.2 ) Other operating expenses 18.3 36.8 (50.3 ) Depreciation and amortization expenses 157.1 159.1 (1.3 ) General and administrative expenses 1,086.7 904.4 20.2 Restructuring and impairments 135.9 131.5 3.3 Total operating expenses 1,524.2 1,541.6 (1.1 ) Operating loss $ (1,401.8 ) $ (1,245.1 ) 12.6 % Corporate and Other primarily consists of our unallocated corporate expenses, as well as Evolution Fresh and the legacy operations of the Teavana retail business, which substantially ceased during fiscal 2018. Unallocated corporate expenses include corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments. FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash and Investment Overview Our cash and investments were $3.0 billion and $9.2 billion as of September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018 , respectively, with the decrease driven by the usage of the up-front prepaid royalty associated with the Global Coffee Alliance primarily for share repurchases. We actively manage our cash and investments in order to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, make acquisitions, and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases. Our investment portfolio primarily includes highly liquid available-for-sale securities, including government treasury securities (domestic and foreign) and corporate debt securities. As of September 29, 2019 , approximately $1.7 billion of cash was held in foreign subsidiaries. Borrowing capacity Our $2.0 billion unsecured 5-year revolving credit facility (the “2018 credit facility”) and our $1.0 billion unsecured 364-Day credit facility (the “364-day credit facility”) are available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases. The 2018 credit facility, of which $150 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit, is currently set to mature on October 25, 2022 . We have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $500 million . Borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR, and, for U.S. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the credit facility) in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on the better of (i) the Company's long-term credit ratings assigned by Moody's and Standard & Poor's rating agencies and (ii) the Company's fixed charge coverage ratio, pursuant to a pricing grid set forth in the five-year credit agreement. The current applicable margin is 0.910% for Eurocurrency Rate Loans and 0.000% (nil) for Base Rate Loans. The 364-day credit facility, of which no amount may be used for issuances of letters of credit, was set to mature on October 23, 2019. In the first quarter of fiscal 2020, the maturity has been extended to October 21, 2020 . We have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $500 million . Borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR, and, for U.S. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is 0.920% for Eurocurrency Rate Loans and 0.000% (nil) for Base Rate Loans. Both credit facilities contain provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which measures our ability to cover financing expenses. As of September 29, 2019 , we were in 36 Table of Contents compliance with all applicable credit facility covenants. No amounts were outstanding under our credit facility as of September 29, 2019 . Under our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion , with individual maturities that may vary but not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. Amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program are required to be backstopped by available commitments under our credit facilities discussed above. The proceeds from borrowings under our commercial paper program may be used for working capital needs, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, business expansion, payment of cash dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. As of September 29, 2019 , we had no borrowings under our commercial paper program. In May 2019 , we issued long-term debt in an underwritten registered public offering, which consisted of $1.0 billion of 10-year 3.550% Senior Notes (the “2029 notes”) due August 2029 and $1.0 billion of 30-year 4.450% Senior Notes (the “2049 notes”) due August 2049 . Interest on the 2029 notes and the 2049 notes is payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15, commencing on August 15, 2019. In August 2018, we issued long-term debt in an underwritten registered public offering, which consisted of $1.25 billion of 7-year 3.800% Senior Notes (the “2025 notes”) due August 2025, $750 million of 10-year 4.000% Senior Notes (the “2028 notes”) due November 2028 and $1 billion of 30-year 4.500% Senior Notes (the “2048 notes”) due November 2048. Interest on the 2025 notes is payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15, commencing on February 15, 2019. Interest on the 2028 and 2048 notes is payable semi-annually on May 15 and November 15, commencing on November 15, 2018. In February 2018, we issued long-term debt in an underwritten registered public offering, which consisted of $1.0 billion of 5-year 3.100% Senior Notes (the “2023 notes”) due March 2023 and $600 million of 10-year 3.500% Senior Notes (the “2028 notes”) due March 2028. Interest on the 2023 and 2028 notes is payable semi-annually on March 1 and September 1, commencing on September 1, 2018. In November 2017, we issued long-term debt in an underwritten registered public offering, which consisted of $500 million of 3-year 2.200% Senior Notes (the “2020 notes”) due November 2020 and $500 million of 30-year 3.750% Senior Notes (the “2047 notes”) due December 2047. Interest on the 2020 notes is payable semi-annually on May 22 and November 22, commencing on May 22, 2018 and interest on the 2047 notes is payable semi-annually on June 1 and December 1, commencing on June 1, 2018. We will use the net proceeds from the offering of the 2049 notes to enhance our sustainability programs. We will use the net proceeds from these remaining offerings for general corporate purposes, including the repurchases of our common stock under our ongoing share repurchase program, business expansion and payment of dividends. See Note 9 , Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for details of the components of our long-term debt. The indentures under which all of our Senior Notes were issued require us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including limits on future liens and sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties. As of September 29, 2019 , we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. Use of Cash We expect to use our available cash and investments, including, but not limited to, additional potential future borrowings under the credit facilities, commercial paper program and the issuance of debt, to invest in our core businesses, including capital expenditures, new product innovations, related marketing support and partner and digital investments, return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases, as well as other new business opportunities related to our core and other developing businesses. Further, we may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our investees. We may also seek strategic acquisitions to leverage existing capabilities and further build our business in support of our growth agenda. Acquisitions may include increasing our ownership interests in our investees. Any decisions to increase such ownership interests will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy. We believe that future cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and investments both domestically and internationally combined with our ability to leverage our balance sheet through the issuance of debt will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses as well as any shareholder distributions for the foreseeable future. Significant new joint ventures, acquisitions and/or other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding. We have borrowed funds and continue to believe we have the ability to do so at reasonable interest rates; however, additional borrowings would result in increased interest expense in the future. In this regard, we may incur additional debt, within targeted levels, as part of our plans to fund our capital programs, including cash returns to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We regularly review our cash positions and our determination of indefinite reinvestment of foreign earnings. In the event we determine that all or a portion of such foreign earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested, we may be subject to additional 37 Table of Contents foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes, which could be material. We have revised our indefinite reinvestment assertions for prior years' cumulative earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries. This change did not have a material impact to our financial results. We have not, nor do we anticipate the need for, repatriated funds to the U.S. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs. See Note 13 , Income Taxes, for further discussion. During each of the first two quarters of fiscal 2018 , we declared a cash dividend to shareholders of $0.30 per share. In the last two quarters of fiscal 2018 and each of the first three quarters of fiscal 2019 , we declared a cash dividend of $0.36 per share. Dividends are paid in the quarter following the declaration date. Cash returned to shareholders through dividends in fiscal 2019 and 2018 totaled $1.8 billion and $1.7 billion , respectively. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 , we declared a cash dividend of $0.41 per share to be paid on November 29, 2019 with an expected payout of approximately $486 million . We entered into accelerated share repurchase agreements (“ASR agreements”) with third-party financial institutions totaling $5.0 billion , effective October 1, 2018. We made a $5.0 billion up-front payment to the financial institutions and received an initial delivery of 72.0 million shares of our common stock. In March 2019 , we received an additional 4.9 million shares upon the completion of the program based on a volume-weighted average share price (less discount) of $65.03 . Additionally, we entered into ASR agreements with third-party financial institutions totaling $2.0 billion , effective March 22, 2019. We made a $2.0 billion up-front payment to the financial institutions and received an initial delivery of 22.2 million shares of our common stock. In June 2019 , we received an additional 3.9 million shares upon the completion of the program based on a volume-weighted average share price (less discount) of $76.50 . Outside of the ASR agreements noted above, during fiscal 2019 and 2018 , we repurchased 36.6 million and 131.5 million shares of common stock, respectively, or $3.1 billion and $7.2 billion , respectively, on the open market. For fiscal 2019 , in connection with the ASR agreements and other open market transactions, we repurchased 139.6 million shares of common stock at a total cost of $10.1 billion. In the first quarter 2019, we announced that our Board of Directors approved an increase of 120 million shares to our ongoing share repurchase program. As of September 29, 2019 , 29.2 million shares remained available for repurchase under current authorizations. Other than normal operating expenses, cash requirements for fiscal 2020 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for investments in our new and existing stores and our supply chain and corporate facilities. Total capital expenditures for fiscal 2020 are expected to be approximately $1.8 billion . Cash Flows Cash provided by operating activities was $5.0 billion for fiscal 2019 , compared to $11.9 billion for fiscal 2018 . The change was primarily driven by lapping the prior year receipt of the up-front payment from Nestlé in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018. Cash used by investing activities totaled $1.0 billion for fiscal 2019 , compared to $2.4 billion for fiscal 2018 . The change was primarily driven by lapping the prior year payment to acquire the 50% ownership interest in our East China joint venture and higher proceeds from the divestiture of certain operations. Cash used by financing activities for fiscal 2019 totaled $10.1 billion , compared to $3.2 billion for fiscal 2018 . The change was primarily due to lower proceeds from issuance of long-term debt and higher repurchases of our common stock under accelerated share repurchase agreements in fiscal 2019. 38 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and borrowings as of September 29, 2019 , and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods ( in millions ): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations (1) Total Less than 1 Year 1 - 3 Years 3 - 5 Years More than 5 Years Operating lease obligations (2) $ 10,230.9 $ 1,432.9 $ 2,589.6 $ 2,120.7 $ 4,087.7 Financing lease obligations 67.9 5.2 10.2 9.9 42.6 Debt obligations Principal payments 11,238.3 — 1,750.0 2,538.3 6,950.0 Interest payments 5,109.7 372.6 705.1 602.3 3,429.7 Purchase obligations (3) 1,135.4 665.3 411.1 59.0 — Other obligations (4) 454.6 109.4 63.2 85.3 196.7 Total $ 28,236.8 $ 2,585.4 $ 5,529.2 $ 5,415.5 $ 14,706.7 (1) We have excluded long-term gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions, including interest and penalties of $140.1 million from the amounts presented as the timing of these obligations is uncertain. (2) Amounts include direct lease obligations, excluding any taxes, insurance and other related expenses. (3) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on Starbucks and that specify all significant terms. Green coffee purchase commitments comprise 93% of total purchase obligations. (4) Other obligations include other long-term liabilities primarily consisting of the Tax Act transition tax, asset retirement obligations, Valor Siren Ventures I L.P. (VSV) investment and hedging instruments. Starbucks currently expects to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Off-balance sheet arrangements relate to operating lease and purchase commitments detailed in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. COMMODITY PRICES, AVAILABILITY AND GENERAL RISK CONDITIONS Commodity price risk represents Starbucks primary market risk, generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products, among other items. We purchase, roast and sell high-quality arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. In addition to coffee, we also purchase significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our company-operated stores. The price and availability of these commodities directly impacts our results of operations, and we expect commodity prices, particularly coffee, to impact future results of operations. For additional details see Product Supply in Item 1 , as well as Risk Factors in Item 1A of this 10-K. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT Market risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity security prices and interest rates. We manage our exposure to various market-based risks according to a market price risk management policy. Under this policy, market-based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies, such as entering into hedging transactions. The market price risk management policy governs how hedging instruments may be used to mitigate risk. Risk limits are set annually and prohibit speculative trading activity. We also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk, which we consider to be low. Excluding interest rate swaps, hedging instruments generally do not have maturities in excess of three years . Refer to Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 3 , Derivative Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion of our hedging instruments. The sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited, point-in-time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed. The actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses. 39 Table of Contents Commodity Price Risk We purchase commodity inputs, primarily coffee, dairy products, diesel, cocoa, sugar and other commodities, that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results. We use a combination of pricing features embedded within supply contracts, such as fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed contracts for coffee purchases, and financial derivatives to manage our commodity price risk exposure. The following table summarizes the potential impact as of September 29, 2019 to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income (“OCI”) from changes in commodity prices. The information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items (in millions) : Increase/(Decrease) to Net Earnings Increase/(Decrease) to OCI 10% Increase in Underlying Rate 10% Decrease in Underlying Rate 10% Increase in Underlying Rate 10% Decrease in Underlying Rate Commodity hedges $ 2 $ (2 ) $ 5 $ (5 ) Foreign Currency Exchange Risk The majority of our revenue, expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the U.S., we have transactions in other currencies, primarily the Chinese renminbi, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, British pound, South Korean won and euro. To reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations, we enter into derivative instruments to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated intercompany royalty payments, inventory purchases, intercompany borrowing and lending activities and certain other transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the entity that enters into the arrangements, as well as the translation risk of certain balance sheet items. See Note 3 , Derivative Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion. The following table summarizes the potential impact as of September 29, 2019 to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due to a change in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign exchange rates. The information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items ( in millions ): Increase/(Decrease) to Net Earnings Increase/(Decrease) to OCI 10% Increase in Underlying Rate 10% Decrease in Underlying Rate 10% Increase in Underlying Rate 10% Decrease in Underlying Rate Foreign currency hedges $ 35 $ (35 ) $ 109 $ (109 ) Equity Security Price Risk We have minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds and equity exchange-traded funds within our marketable equity securities portfolio. Marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value and approximates a portion of our liability under our Management Deferred Compensation Plan (“MDCP”). Gains and losses from the portfolio and the change in our MDCP liability are recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings. We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of September 29, 2019 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments. 40 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk Long-term Debt We utilize short-term and long-term financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage our overall interest expense related to our existing fixed-rate debt, as well as to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates related to anticipated debt issuances. See Note 3 , Derivative Financial Instruments and Note 9 , Debt, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K for further discussion of our interest rate hedge agreements and details of the components of our long-term debt, respectively, as of September 29, 2019 . The following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates as of September 29, 2019 on the fair value of Starbucks debt (in millions) : Change in Fair Value Fair Value 100 Basis Point Increase in Underlying Rate 100 Basis Point Decrease in Underlying Rate Long-term debt (1) $ 12,033 $ 846 $ (846 ) (1) Amount disclosed is net of ($26 million) change in the fair value of our designated interest rate swap. Refer to Note 3 , Derivative Financial Instruments, for additional information on our interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge. Available-for-Sale Debt Securities Our available-for-sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of investment-grade debt securities. The primary objective of these investments is to preserve capital and liquidity. Available-for-sale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. We do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our investments. We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our available-for-sale securities as of September 29, 2019 and determined that such a change would not have a significant impact on the fair value of these instruments. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. We believe that of our significant accounting policies, the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and/or complexity. We consider financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies quarterly to ensure that they provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment. During the past five fiscal years, we have not made any material changes to the accounting methodologies used to assess the areas discussed below, unless noted otherwise. Property, Plant and Equipment and Other Finite-Lived Assets We evaluate property, plant and equipment and other finite-lived assets for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. When evaluating for impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The adjusted carrying amount of the asset becomes its new cost basis and is depreciated over the asset's remaining useful life. Long-lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For company-operated store assets, the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level. The fair value of a store’s assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. For other long-lived assets, fair value is determined using an approach that is appropriate based on the relevant facts and circumstances, which may include discounted cash flows, comparable transactions, or comparable company analyses. Our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values. Key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values include projected revenue growth and operating expenses, as well as forecasting asset useful lives and selecting an 41 Table of Contents appropriate discount rate. For company-operated stores, estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections and consider the store’s historical performance, the local market economics and the business environment impacting the store’s performance. The discount rate is selected based on what we believe a buyer would assume when determining a purchase price for the store. These estimates are subjective and our ability to realize future cash flows and asset fair values is affected by factors such as ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets, changes in economic conditions, and changes in operating performance. During fiscal 2019 , there were no significant changes in any of our estimates or assumptions that had a material impact on the outcome of our impairment calculations. However, as we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values, changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets We evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that impairment may exist. When evaluating these assets for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit using discounted cash flows or a combination of discounted cash flow and market approaches. When assessing goodwill for impairment, our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment for an individual reporting unit in a given year is influenced by a number of factors, inclusive of the size of the reporting unit's goodwill, the significance of the excess of the reporting unit's estimated fair value over carrying value at the last quantitative assessment date, the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments and the date of acquisition. If we perform a quantitative assessment of an individual reporting unit’s goodwill, our impairment calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment when estimating future cash flows and asset fair values, including projected revenue growth and operating expenses related to existing businesses, product innovation and new store concepts, as well as utilizing valuation multiples of similar publicly traded companies and selecting an appropriate discount rate. Estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses are based on internal projections considering the reporting unit’s past performance and forecasted growth, strategic initiatives, local market economics and the local business environment impacting the reporting unit’s performance. The discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital for a market participant to operate the reporting unit in the region. These estimates, as well as the selection of comparable companies and valuation multiples used in the market approaches are highly subjective, and our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion. When assessing indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, where we perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate if changes in events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that impairment may exist. If we do not perform a qualitative impairment assessment or if changes in events and circumstances indicate that a quantitative assessment should be performed, management is required to calculate the fair value of the intangible asset group. The fair value calculation includes estimates of revenue growth, which are based on past performance and internal projections for the intangible asset group's forecasted growth, and royalty rates, which are adjusted for our particular facts and circumstances. The discount rate is selected based on the estimated cost of capital that reflects the risk profile of the related business. These estimates are highly subjective, and our ability to achieve the forecasted cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as the success of strategic initiatives, changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance and changes in our business strategies, including retail initiatives and international expansion. The goodwill impairment charges are discussed in Note 8 , Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K. Income Taxes We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. We routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of operations. In projecting future taxable income, we consider historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal and foreign pretax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. Our assumptions regarding future taxable income are consistent with the plans and estimates 42 Table of Contents we use to manage our underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income/(loss). In addition, our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include review of our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions. We evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of our position. For uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold, we record a related liability. We adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available. As discussed in Note 13 , Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, there is a reasonable possibility that our unrecognized tax benefit liability will be adjusted within 12 months due to the expiration of a statute of limitations and/or resolution of examinations with taxing authorities. We have generated income in certain foreign jurisdictions that may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes. We have revised our indefinite reinvestment assertions for prior years’ cumulative earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries. We regularly review our plans for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings. While we do not expect to repatriate cash to the U.S. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs, if these amounts were distributed to the U.S., in the form of dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes, which could be material. Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. Deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation, the status of various income tax audits and our particular facts and circumstances. Although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material. To the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability, our effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected. Refer to Note 13 , Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, for additional discussion surrounding the changes as a result of the Tax Act.

September 30, 2018 and October 1, 2017 Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Description of Business We purchase and roast high-quality coffees that we sell, along with handcrafted coffee and tea beverages and a variety of fresh and prepared food items, through our company-operated stores. We also sell a variety of coffee and tea products and license our trademarks through other channels such as licensed stores, grocery and foodservice. The grocery and foodservice business is primarily through our Global Coffee Alliance with Nestlé established in August 2018. In this 10-K, Starbucks Corporation (together with its subsidiaries) is referred to as “Starbucks,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our.” Certain prior period information on the consolidated balance sheets and the consolidated statements of cash flows has been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. Segment information is prepared on the same basis that our management reviews financial information for operational decision-making purposes. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we realigned our operating segment reporting structure to better reflect the cumulative effect of our streamlining efforts. Specifically, our previous China/Asia Pacific (""CAP"") segment and Europe, Middle East, and Africa (""EMEA"") segment have been combined into one International segment. Results of Siren Retail, a non-reportable operating segment consisting of Starbucks Reserve TM Roastery & Tasting Rooms, certain stores under the Starbucks Reserve brand and Princi operations, which were previously included within Corporate and Other, are now reported within the Americas and International segments based on the geographical location of the operations. Further, to better support the review of our results, we have changed the classification of certain costs. The most significant change was the reclassification of our company-owned store occupancy costs from cost of sales to store operating expenses of $ 2.2 billion and $ 2.0 billion for fiscal 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Total store occupancy costs in fiscal 2019 were $ 2.4 billion . We also made certain other immaterial changes. There was no impact to consolidated net revenues, consolidated operating income, or net earnings per share as a result of these changes and prior period financial information has been revised to be consistent with the current period presentation. Additional details on the nature of our business and our reportable operating segments are included in Note 16 , Segment Reporting. We have three reportable operating segments: 1) Americas, which is inclusive of the U.S., Canada, and Latin America; 2) International, which is inclusive of China/Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East, and Africa; and 3) Channel Development. Non-reportable operating segments such as Evolution Fresh and unallocated corporate expenses are reported within Corporate and Other. Principles of Consolidation Our consolidated financial statements reflect the financial position and operating results of Starbucks, including wholly-owned subsidiaries and investees that we control. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Fiscal Year End Our fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. Fiscal 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 included 52 weeks. Estimates and Assumptions Preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Examples include, but are not limited to, estimates for inventory reserves, asset and goodwill impairments, assumptions underlying self-insurance reserves, income from unredeemed stored value cards, stock-based compensation forfeiture rates, future asset retirement obligations and the potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements. Actual results and outcomes may differ from these estimates and assumptions. Cash and Cash Equivalents We consider all highly liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase, as well as credit card receivables for sales to customers in our company-operated stores that generally settle within two to five business days, to be cash equivalents. We maintain cash and cash equivalent balances with financial institutions that exceed federally-insured limits. We have not experienced any losses related to these balances, and we believe credit risk to be minimal. 50 Table of Contents Our cash management system provides for the funding of all major bank disbursement accounts on a daily basis as checks are presented for payment. Under this system, outstanding checks are in excess of the cash balances at certain banks, which creates book overdrafts. Book overdrafts are presented as a current liability in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Investments Available-for-sale Debt Securities Our short-term and long-term investments consist primarily of investment-grade debt securities, all of which are classified as available-for-sale. Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair value, and unrealized holding gains and losses are recorded, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Available-for-sale securities with remaining maturities of less than one year and those identified by management at the time of purchase to be used to fund operations within one year are classified as short-term. All other available-for-sale securities are classified as long-term. We evaluate our available-for-sale securities for other-than-temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. Unrealized losses are charged against net earnings when a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary. We review several factors to determine whether a loss is other than temporary, such as the length and extent of the fair value decline, the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer and whether we have the intent to sell or will more likely than not be required to sell before the securities' anticipated recovery, which may be at maturity. Realized gains and losses are accounted for using the specific identification method. Purchases and sales are recorded on a trade date basis. Marketable Equity Securities We also have a marketable equity securities portfolio, which is comprised of marketable equity mutual funds and equity exchange-traded funds. Marketable equity securities are recorded at fair value and approximates a portion of our liability under our Management Deferred Compensation Plan (“MDCP”). Gains or losses from the portfolio and the change in our MDCP liability are recorded in our consolidated statements of earnings. Equity Investments Equity investments are accounted under the equity method if we are able to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. Our share of the earnings or losses as reported by the investees are classified as income from equity investees on our consolidated statements of earnings. The investments are evaluated for impairment annually and when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. If a decline in fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. We account for equity investments for which we do not have significant influence and without readily determinable fair values at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments as permitted by the measurement alternative. Investments for which the measurement alternative has been elected are assessed for impairment quarterly, or if a triggering event indicates impairment may be present. Any adjustments as a result of price changes or impairments are recorded in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. Fair Value Fair value is the price we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability (exit price) in an orderly transaction between market participants. For assets and liabilities recorded or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis, we determine fair value based on the following: Level 1: The carrying value of cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value because of the short-term nature of these instruments. For equity and U.S. government treasury securities and commodity futures contracts, we use quoted prices in active markets for identical assets to determine fair value. Level 2: When quoted prices in active markets for identical assets are not available, we determine the fair value of our available-for-sale securities and our over-the-counter forward contracts, collars and swaps based upon factors such as the quoted market price of similar assets or a discounted cash flow model using readily observable market data, which may include interest rate curves and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities, depending on the nature of the investment. The fair value of our long-term debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates offered to us for debt of the same remaining maturities. Level 3: We determine the fair value of our auction rate securities using an internally-developed valuation model, using inputs that include interest rate curves, credit and liquidity spreads and effective maturity. Assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis may include items such as property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, equity and other investments and other assets. We determine the fair value of these items using Level 3 inputs, as described in the related sections below. 51 Table of Contents Derivative Instruments We manage our exposure to various risks within our consolidated financial statements according to a market price risk management policy. Under this policy, we may engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments to hedge interest rates, commodity prices and foreign currency-denominated revenue streams, inventory purchases, assets and liabilities and investments in certain foreign operations. In order to manage our exposure to these risks, we use various types of derivative instruments including forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, collars and swaps. Forward contracts and commodity futures contracts are agreements to buy or sell a quantity of a currency or commodity at a predetermined future date and at a predetermined rate or price. A collar is a strategy that uses a combination of a purchased call option and a sold put option with equal premiums to hedge a portion of anticipated cash flows, or to limit possible gains or losses on an underlying asset or liability to a specific range. A swap agreement is a contract between two parties to exchange cash flows based on specified underlying notional amounts, assets and/or indices. We do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes. We record all derivatives on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value and typically do not offset derivative assets and liabilities. Excluding interest rate swaps and foreign currency debt, we generally do not enter into derivative instruments with maturities longer than three years. However, we are allowed to net settle transactions with respective counterparties for certain derivative contracts, inclusive of interest rate swaps and foreign currency forwards, with a single, net amount payable by one party to the other. We also enter into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. Cash collateral under collateral security arrangements were immaterial as of September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018 . The potential effects of netting arrangements with our derivative contracts, excluding the effects of collateral, would not have had a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets. By using these derivative instruments, we expose ourselves to potential credit risk. Credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract. We minimize this credit risk by entering into transactions with carefully selected, credit-worthy counterparties and distribute contracts among several financial institutions to reduce the concentration of credit risk. Cash Flow Hedges For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the derivative's gain or loss is reported as a component of other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) on our consolidated balance sheets. The gain or loss is subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged exposure affects net earnings, in the same line item as the underlying hedged item on our consolidated statements of earnings. Cash flow hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the inception of each hedge. Cash flows from hedging transactions are classified in the same categories as the cash flows from the respective hedged items. For de-designated cash flow hedges in which the transactions are no longer likely to occur, the related accumulated derivative gains or losses are recognized in interest income and other, net or interest expense on our consolidated statements of earnings based on the nature of the underlying transaction. Net Investment Hedges For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a net investment hedge, the derivative's, or qualifying non-derivative instrument’s, gain or loss is reported as a component of OCI and recorded in AOCI. The gain or loss will be subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. 52 Table of Contents Fair Value Hedges For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the changes in fair value of the derivative instrument and the offsetting changes in fair value of the underlying hedged item due to changes in the hedged risk are recorded in interest income and other, net or interest expense on our consolidated statements of earnings. Derivatives Not Designated As Hedging Instruments We also enter into certain foreign currency forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, collars and swaps that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. The changes in the fair values of these contracts are immediately recognized in interest income and other, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. Normal Purchase Normal Sale We enter into fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed green coffee purchase commitments, which are described further in Note 5 , Inventories. For both fixed-price and price-to-be-fixed purchase commitments, we expect to take delivery of green coffee and to utilize the coffee in a reasonable period of time in the ordinary course of business. Since these types of purchase commitments qualify for the normal purchase normal sale exemption, they are not recorded as derivative instruments on our consolidated balance sheets. Refer to Note 3 , Derivative Financial Instruments, and Note 5 , Inventories, for further discussion of our derivative instruments and green coffee purchase commitments. Receivables, net of Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Our receivables are mainly comprised of receivables for product and equipment sales to and royalties from our licensees, as well as receivables from our Global Coffee Alliance and other Channel Development customers. Our allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated based on historical experience, customer credit risk and application of the specific identification method. As of September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018 , our allowance for doubtful accounts was $ 6.7 million and $ 8.0 million , respectively. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (primarily moving average cost) or net realizable value. We record inventory reserves for obsolete and slow-moving inventory and for estimated shrinkage between physical inventory counts. Inventory reserves are based on inventory obsolescence trends, historical experience and application of the specific identification method. As of September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018 , inventory reserves were $ 33.7 million and $ 41.5 million , respectively. Property, Plant and Equipment Property, plant and equipment, which includes assets under capital leases, are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes all direct costs necessary to acquire and prepare assets for use, including internal labor and overhead in some cases. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives of the assets, generally ranging from 2 to 15 years for equipment and 30 to 40 years for buildings. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the related lease life, generally 10 years . For leases with renewal periods at our option, we generally use the original lease term, excluding renewal option periods, to determine estimated useful lives. If failure to exercise a renewal option imposes an economic penalty to us, we may determine at the inception of the lease that renewal is reasonably assured and include the renewal option period in the determination of the appropriate estimated useful lives. The portion of depreciation expense related to production and distribution facilities is included in cost of sales on our consolidated statements of earnings. The costs of repairs and maintenance are expensed when incurred, while expenditures for refurbishments and improvements that significantly add to the productive capacity or extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized. When assets are disposed of, whether through retirement or sale, the net gain or loss is recognized in net earnings. Long-lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell. We evaluate property, plant and equipment for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable. When evaluating for impairment, we first compare the carrying value of the asset to the asset’s estimated future undiscounted cash flows. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we determine if we have an impairment loss by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the asset's estimated fair value and recognize an impairment charge when the asset’s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value. The fair value of the asset is estimated using a discounted cash flow model based on forecasted future revenues and operating costs, using internal projections. Property, plant and equipment assets are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities. For company-operated store assets, the impairment test is performed at the individual store asset group level. 53 Table of Contents We recognized net disposition charges of $ 64.6 million , $ 32.8 million , and $ 46.9 million in fiscal 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , respectively. Additionally, we recognized net impairment charges of $ 43.4 million , $ 42.8 million , and $ 56.1 million in fiscal 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , respectively. Of the total net impairment charges, $ 7.1 million and $ 37.0 million in fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively, were restructuring related and recorded in restructuring and impairment expenses. Unless it is restructuring related, the nature of the underlying asset that is impaired or disposed of will determine the operating expense line on which the related impact is recorded on our consolidated statements of earnings. Goodwill We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during our third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change, such as material deterioration in performance or a significant number of store closures, that would indicate that impairment may exist. When evaluating goodwill for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that a reporting unit is impaired. If we do not perform a qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. Fair value is typically calculated using a discounted cash flow model. For certain reporting units, where deemed appropriate, we may also utilize a market approach for estimating fair value. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value. As part of our ongoing operations, we may close certain stores within a reporting unit containing goodwill due to underperformance of the store or inability to renew our lease, among other reasons. We may abandon certain assets associated with a closed store, including leasehold improvements and other non-transferable assets. When a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business is to be disposed of, goodwill associated with the business is included in the carrying amount of the business in determining any loss on disposal. Our evaluation of whether the portion of a reporting unit being disposed of constitutes a business occurs on the date of abandonment. Although an operating store meets the accounting definition of a business prior to abandonment, it does not constitute a business on the closure date because the remaining assets on that date do not constitute an integrated set of activities (substantive processes) and assets that are capable of being managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. As a result, when closing individual stores, we do not include goodwill in the calculation of any loss on disposal of the related assets. We recorded goodwill impairment of $ 10.5 million , $ 37.6 million and $ 87.2 million during fiscal 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , respectively. See Note 8 , Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill, for further information. Other Intangible Assets Other intangible assets include finite-lived intangible assets, which mainly consist of acquired and reacquired rights, trade secrets, licensing agreements, contract-based patents and copyrights. These assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment using a similar methodology to our property, plant and equipment, as described above. Indefinite-lived intangibles, which consist primarily of trade names and trademarks, are tested for impairment annually during the third fiscal quarter, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that impairment may exist. When evaluating other intangible assets for impairment, we may first perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an intangible asset group is impaired. If we do not perform the qualitative assessment, or if we determine that it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the intangible asset group exceeds its carrying amount, we calculate the estimated fair value of the intangible asset group. Fair value is the price a willing buyer would pay for the intangible asset group and is typically calculated using an income approach, such as a relief-from-royalty model. If the carrying amount of the intangible asset group exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair value. In addition, we continuously monitor and may revise our intangible asset useful lives if and when facts and circumstances change. There were no significant other intangible asset impairment charges recorded during fiscal 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 . Insurance Reserves We use a combination of insurance and self-insurance mechanisms, including a wholly-owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance treaty, to provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks, including workers’ compensation, healthcare benefits, general liability, property insurance and director and officers’ liability insurance. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by us are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographics, exposure and severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. Revenue Recognition Consolidated revenues are presented net of intercompany eliminations for wholly-owned subsidiaries and investees controlled by us and for product sales to and royalty and other fees from licensees accounted for under the equity method. Additionally, 54 Table of Contents consolidated revenues are recognized net of any discounts, returns, allowances and sales incentives, including coupon redemptions and rebates. Company-operated Store Revenues Company-operated store revenues are recognized when payment is tendered at the point of sale as the performance obligation has been satisfied. Company-operated store revenues are reported excluding sales, use or other transaction taxes that are collected from customers and remitted to taxing authorities. Licensed Store Revenues Licensed store revenues consist of product and equipment sales, royalties and other fees paid by licensees using the Starbucks brand. Sales of coffee, tea, food and related products are generally recognized upon shipment to licensees, depending on contract terms. Shipping charges billed to licensees are also recognized as revenue, and the related shipping costs are included in cost of sales on our consolidated statements of earnings. We consider pre-opening services, including site evaluation and selection, store architectural/design and development and operational training, to be performance obligations that are separate from the license to operate under the Starbucks brand. These services provide distinct value to our licensees, including business and industry insight and knowledge that transfers value apart from the license. Revenues associated with pre-opening services are recognized upon completion of the related performance obligations, generally when a store is opened. Royalty revenues are recognized based upon a percentage of reported sales, and other continuing fees, such as marketing and service fees, are recognized as the performance obligations are met. Stored Value Cards Stored value cards can be activated through various channels, including at our company-operated and most licensed store locations, online at Starbucks.com or via mobile devices held by our customers, and at certain other third-party websites and locations, such as grocery stores, although they cannot be reloaded at these third-party websites or locations. Amounts loaded onto stored value cards are initially recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue upon redemption. Historically, the majority of stored value cards are redeemed within one year. In many of our company-owned markets, including the U.S., our stored value cards do not have an expiration date nor do we charge service fees that cause a decrement to customer balances. Based on historical redemption rates, a portion of stored value cards is not expected to be redeemed and will be recognized as breakage over time in proportion to stored value card redemptions. The redemption rates are based on historical redemption patterns for each market, including the timing and business channel in which the card was activated, and remittance to government agencies under unclaimed property laws, if applicable. Breakage is recognized as company-operated stores and licensed stores revenue within the consolidated statement of earnings beginning in fiscal 2019 in accordance with the new revenue recognition guidance as discussed in the recently adopted accounting pronouncements section of this note. For the year ended September 29, 2019 , we recognized breakage revenue of $ 125.1 million in company-operated store revenues and $ 15.7 million in licensed store revenues. Prior to the adoption of the new revenue recognition guidance, breakage was recorded using the remote method and recorded in interest income and other, net. In fiscal 2018 and 2017 , we recognized breakage income of $ 155.9 million , and $ 104.6 million , respectively. There were no material impacts to our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 29, 2019 including the change in income statement presentation. Loyalty Program Customers in the U.S., Canada, and certain other countries who register their Starbucks Card are automatically enrolled in the Starbucks ® Rewards program, which is primarily a spend-based loyalty program. They earn loyalty points (“Stars”) with each purchase at participating Starbucks ® stores and when making purchases with the Starbucks-branded credit and debit cards. After accumulating a certain number of Stars, the customer earns a reward that can be redeemed for free product that, regardless of where the related Stars were earned within that country, will be honored at company-operated stores and certain participating licensed store locations in that same country. We defer revenue associated with the estimated selling price of Stars earned by Starbucks ® Rewards members towards free product as each Star is earned and a corresponding liability is established in deferred revenue. This deferral is based on the estimated value of the product for which the reward is expected to be redeemed, net of estimated unredeemed Stars. Stars generally expire after six months. When a customer redeems an earned reward, we recognize revenue for the redeemed product and reduce the related deferred revenue. The new revenue recognition guidance does not impact the timing or total revenue recognized related to the loyalty program. 55 Table of Contents Other Revenues Other revenues primarily include royalty revenues, sales of packaged coffee, tea and a variety of ready-to-drink beverages and single-serve coffee and tea products to customers outside of our company-operated and licensed stores. Sales of these products are generally recognized upon shipment to customers, depending on contract terms. Beginning in late fiscal 2018, other revenues also include product sales to and licensing revenue from Nestlé related to our Global Coffee Alliance. Product sales to Nestlé are generally recognized when the product is shipped whereas royalty revenues are recognized based on a percentage of reported sales. The timing and amount of revenue recognized related to other revenues were not impacted by the adoption of new revenue recognition guidance. Deferred Revenues In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we licensed the rights to sell and market our products in authorized channels through the Global Coffee Alliance, and received an up-front prepaid royalty from Nestlé. The up-front payment of approximately $ 7 billion was recorded as deferred revenue as we have continuing performance obligations to support the Global Coffee Alliance, including providing Nestlé access to certain intellectual properties and products for future resale. The up-front payment will be recognized as other revenue on a straight-line basis over the estimated economic life of the arrangement of 40 years for the ongoing access to the licenses within the contractual territories. Our obligations to maintain the Starbucks brand and other intellectual properties are generally constant throughout the term of the arrangement. Therefore, a ratable recognition pattern is reflective of how we satisfy our performance obligations. At September 29, 2019 , the current and long-term deferred revenue related to the Nestlé up-front payment was $ 175.9 million and $ 6.7 billion , respectively. During the fiscal year ended September 29, 2019 , the Company recognized $ 175.2 million related to amortization of the up-front royalty payment. Additionally, deferred revenues include our unredeemed stored value card liability and unredeemed Stars associated with our loyalty program. Changes in our deferred revenue balance related to our stored value cards and loyalty program (in millions) : Total Stored value cards and loyalty program at September 30, 2018 $ 1,328.6 Revenue recognition adoption impact ( 358.0 ) Stored value cards and loyalty program at October 1, 2018 970.6 Revenue deferred - card activations, card reloads and Stars earned 10,983.6 Revenue recognized - card and Stars redemptions and breakage ( 10,819.7 ) Other (1) ( 20.8 ) Stored value cards and loyalty program at September 29, 2019 (2) $ 1,113.7 (1) “Other” primarily consists of changes in the stored value cards and loyalty program balance resulting from the sale of certain retail businesses and foreign currency translation. (2) Approximately $1.0 billion of this amount is current. Disaggregation of Revenues Revenues disaggregated by segment, product type and geographic area are disclosed in Note 16 , Segment Reporting. Advertising We expense most advertising costs as they are incurred, except for certain production costs that are expensed the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expenses totaled $ 245.7 million , $ 260.3 million and $ 282.6 million in fiscal 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 , respectively. Store Preopening Expenses Costs incurred in connection with the start-up and promotion of new company-operated store openings are expensed as incurred. Leases Operating Leases We lease retail stores, roasting, distribution and warehouse facilities and office space for corporate administrative purposes under operating leases. Most lease agreements contain tenant improvement allowances, rent holidays, lease premiums, rent escalation clauses and/or contingent rent provisions. We recognize amortization of lease incentives, premiums and minimum 56 Table of Contents rent expenses on a straight-line basis beginning on the date of initial possession, which is generally when we enter the space and begin to make improvements in preparation for intended use. For tenant improvement allowances and rent holidays, we record a deferred rent liability within accrued liabilities, or other long-term liabilities, on our consolidated balance sheets and amortize the deferred rent over the terms of the leases as reductions to rent expense in store operating expenses on our consolidated statements of earnings. For premiums paid up-front to enter a lease agreement, we record a prepaid rent asset in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other long-term assets on our consolidated balance sheets and amortize the premium over the terms of the leases as additional rent expense in store operating expenses on our consolidated statements of earnings. For scheduled rent escalation clauses during the lease terms or for rental payments commencing at a date other than the date of initial possession, we record minimum rent expense on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases in store operating expenses on our consolidated statements of earnings, with the adjustments to cash rent accrued as deferred rent in our consolidated balance sheets. Certain leases provide for contingent rent, which is determined as a percentage of gross sales in excess of specified levels. We record a contingent rent liability in accrued occupancy costs within accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets and the corresponding rent expense when we determine that achieving the specified levels during the fiscal year is probable. When ceasing operations of company-operated stores under operating leases, in cases where the lease contract specifies a termination fee due to the landlord, we record such expense at the time written notice is given to the landlord. In cases where terms, including termination fees, are yet to be negotiated with the landlord, we will record the expense upon signing of an agreement with the landlord. In cases where the landlord does not allow us to prematurely exit the lease, we recognize a lease abandonment accrual equal to the present value of the remaining lease payments to the landlord and other rent related payments such as common area maintenance, taxes and insurance, less any projected sublease income at the cease-use date. Lease Financing Arrangements We are sometimes involved in the construction of leased buildings, primarily stores. When we qualify as the deemed owner of these buildings due to significant involvement during the construction period under build-to-suit lease accounting requirements and do not qualify for sales recognition under sales-leaseback accounting guidance, we record the cost of the related buildings in property, plant and equipment, net. The offsetting lease financing obligations are recorded in other long-term liabilities, with the current portion recorded in accrued occupancy costs within accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. These assets and obligations are amortized in depreciation and amortization and interest expense, respectively, on our consolidated statements of earnings based on the terms of the related lease agreements. Asset Retirement Obligations We recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations (“ARO”) when such obligations are incurred. Our AROs are primarily associated with leasehold improvements, which, at the end of a lease, we are contractually obligated to remove in order to comply with the lease agreement. At the inception of a lease with such conditions, we record an ARO liability and a corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation. We estimate the liability using a number of assumptions, including store closing costs, cost inflation rates and discount rates, and accrete the liability to its projected future value over time. The capitalized asset is depreciated using the same depreciation convention as leasehold improvement assets. Upon satisfaction of the ARO conditions, any difference between the recorded ARO liability and the actual retirement costs incurred is recognized as a gain or loss in store operating expense on our consolidated statements of earnings. As of September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018 , our net ARO assets included in property, plant and equipment were $ 23.5 million and $ 19.1 million , respectively, and our net ARO liabilities included in other long-term liabilities were $ 95.5 million and $ 82.4 million , respectively. Stock-based Compensation We maintain several equity incentive plans under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) or stock appreciation rights to employees, non-employee directors and consultants. We also have an employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”). RSUs issued by us are equivalent to nonvested shares under the applicable accounting guidance. We record stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of stock awards at the grant date and recognize the expense over the related service period following a graded vesting expense schedule. Expense for performance-based RSUs is recognized when it is probable the performance goal will be achieved. Performance goals are determined by the Board of Directors and may include measures such as earnings per share, operating income and return on invested capital. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model. The assumptions used to calculate the fair value of options granted are evaluated and revised, as necessary, to reflect market conditions and our historical experience. The fair value of RSUs is based on the closing price of Starbucks common stock on the award date, less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. 57 Table of Contents If applicable, our total shareholder return relative to our peer group is incorporated into the underlying assumptions used to calculate grant date fair value. Compensation expense is recognized over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of the award, and only for those awards expected to vest, with forfeitures estimated at the date of grant based on our historical experience and future expectations. Foreign Currency Translation Our international operations generally use their local currency as their functional currency. Assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Income and expense accounts are translated at the average monthly exchange rates during the year. Resulting translation adjustments are reported as a component of OCI and recorded in AOCI on our consolidated balance sheets. Income Taxes We compute income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred income taxes are recognized based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred taxes is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. We routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized. In evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets within the jurisdictions from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and results of recent operations. If we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes. In addition, our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include review of our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions. We evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of our position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. For uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold, we record a related liability. We adjust our unrecognized tax benefit liability and income tax expense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when new information becomes available. Starbucks recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense on our consolidated statements of earnings. Accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax balances our consolidated balance sheets. Earnings per Share Basic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock and the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period, calculated using the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options and RSUs. Performance-based RSUs are considered dilutive when the related performance criterion has been met. Common Stock Share Repurchases We may repurchase shares of Starbucks common stock under a program authorized by our Board of Directors, including pursuant to a contract, instruction or written plan meeting the requirements of Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under applicable Washington State law, shares repurchased are retired and not displayed separately as treasury stock on the financial statements. Instead, the par value of repurchased shares is deducted from common stock and the excess repurchase price over par value is deducted from additional paid-in capital and from retained earnings. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we adopted the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued guidance on the accounting for hedging relationships. The new guidance eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness, expands permissible cash flow hedges on contractually specified components, and simplifies hedge documentation and effectiveness assessments. The adoption of the new guidance did not have a material impact on our 58 Table of Contents consolidated financial statements. The presentation and disclosure requirements are being applied prospectively. See Note 3 , Derivative Financial Instruments for further discussion. In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we adopted the new FASB guidance on the accounting for income tax effects of intercompany sales or transfers of assets other than inventory. The guidance requires entities to recognize the income tax impact of an intra-entity sale or transfer of an asset other than inventory when the sale or transfer occurs, rather than when the asset has been sold to an outside party. The primary impact of the adoption was an increase to deferred income taxes, net of $ 227.6 million and a corresponding cumulative adjustment to opening retained earnings at the beginning of fiscal 2019. In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we adopted the new FASB guidance on revenue recognition utilizing the modified retrospective method, which primarily changed the accounting method and classification of revenue recognition related to unredeemed stored value cards, referred to as stored value card breakage. Under this new guidance, expected breakage amounts must be recognized proportionately in earnings as redemptions occur. Previously, stored value card breakage was recorded to interest income and other, net utilizing the remote method. Starting in the first quarter of 2019, stored value card breakage was recorded in the revenue lines where stored value cards may be redeemed, within company-operated and licensed store revenues. The cumulative impact to retained earnings as of October 1, 2018 was $ 268.0 million . Impact of adoption on our consolidated balance sheet at September 30, 2018: (in millions) As reported Sep 30, 2018 Revenue Recognition Adoption Impact Adjusted Oct 1, 2018 Deferred income taxes, net $ 134.7 $ ( 11.0 ) $ 123.7 Current liabilities: Stored value card liability and current portion of deferred revenue 1,642.9 ( 422.0 ) 1,220.9 Deferred revenue 6,775.7 64.0 6,839.7 Other long-term liabilities 1,430.5 79.0 1,509.5 Shareholders' equity: Retained earnings 1,457.4 268.0 1,725.4 Due to the adoption, we began classifying stored value card liabilities as current and long-term deferred revenue. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In February 2018, the FASB issued guidance on the reclassification of certain tax effects from AOCI. The guidance permits entities to reclassify the stranded tax effects resulting from the Tax Act from AOCI to retained earnings. The guidance will be effective at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2020 and will be adopted prospectively. We do not expect a material impact upon adoption of this guidance. In February 2016, the FASB issued guidance on the recognition and measurement of leases. Under the new guidance, lessees are required to recognize a lease liability, which represents the discounted obligation to make future minimum lease payments, and a corresponding right-of-use asset on the balance sheet for most leases. The guidance retains the current accounting for lessors and does not make significant changes to the recognition, measurement, and presentation of expenses and cash flows by a lessee. Enhanced disclosures will also be required to give financial statement users the ability to assess the amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. We will be applying the guidance, as permitted by the alternative method issued by the FASB, at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal 2020, with certain practical expedients. Most significantly, we are electing the ‘package of practical expedients,’ which allows us to rely on our prior conclusions regarding lease identification, classification and initial direct costs. In preparation for the adoption of the guidance, we are in the process of implementing controls and key system changes to enable the preparation of financial information. We expect this adoption will result in a right-of-use asset and lease liability in the range of approximately $ 8 billion to $ 9 billion on our consolidated balance sheets but will have an insignificant impact on our consolidated statements of earnings. 59 Table of Contents Note 2: Acquisitions, Divestitures and Strategic Alliance Fiscal 2019 In the third quarter of fiscal 2019, we sold our company-operated retail business in Thailand to Coffee Concepts Thailand, a joint-venture between Maxim's Caterers Limited and F&N Retail Connection Co. Ltd, converting this operation to a fully licensed market. This transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $ 601.9 million , which was included in net gains resulting from divestiture of certain operations on our consolidated statements of earnings. In the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we sold our company-operated retail businesses in France and the Netherlands to Alsea, S.A.B. de C.V. converting these operations to fully licensed markets. These transactions did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Fiscal 2018 We entered into an agreement on May 6, 2018 to establish the Global Coffee Alliance with Nestlé. On August 26, 2018, Nestlé licensed the rights to market, sell and distribute Starbucks consumer packaged goods and foodservice products in authorized channels. We received an up-front payment of approximately $ 7 billion consisting primarily of prepaid royalties which was recorded to current and long-term deferred revenue. See Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, for the accounting treatment. On March 23, 2018, we sold our company-operated retail store assets and operations in Brazil to SouthRock, converting these operations to a fully licensed market. This transaction did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. On December 31, 2017, we acquired the remaining 50 % interest of our East China joint venture (“East China”) from President Chain Store (Hong Kong) Holding Ltd. and Kai Yu (BVI) collectively, “Uni-President Group” or “UPG”, for approximately $ 1.4 billion . Approximately $ 90.5 million of pre-existing liabilities owed by East China to Starbucks were effectively settled upon the acquisition. Acquiring the remaining interest of East China, which at the time operated over 1,400 stores in the Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces, built on the Company's ongoing investment in China. The estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on valuation and analysis performed by management. Concurrently with the purchase of our East China joint venture, we sold our 50 % interest in President Starbucks Coffee Taiwan Limited, our joint venture operations in Taiwan, to UPG for approximately $ 181.2 million . The transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $ 156.6 million which was included in net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations on our consolidated statements of earnings. 60 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the preliminary allocation of the total consideration to the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of December 31, 2017 , which are reported within our International segment (in millions) : Consideration: Cash paid for UPG 50% equity interest $ 1,440.8 Fair value of our pre-existing 50% equity interest 1,440.8 Settlement of pre-existing liabilities 90.5 Total consideration $ 2,972.1 Fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed: Cash and cash equivalents $ 129.5 Accounts receivable 14.3 Inventories 16.1 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 20.6 Property, plant and equipment 254.1 Other long-term assets 44.6 Other intangible assets 818.0 Goodwill 2,164.1 Total assets acquired $ 3,461.3 Accounts payable 34.7 Accrued liabilities 187.7 Stored value card liability 21.7 Other long-term liabilities 245.1 Total liabilities assumed 489.2 Total consideration $ 2,972.1 As a result of this acquisition, we remeasured the carrying value of our preexisting 50 % equity method investment to fair value, which resulted in a total gain of $ 1.4 billion that is not subject to income tax, and was presented as gain resulting from acquisition of joint venture on our consolidated statements of earnings. The fair value of $ 1.4 billion was calculated using an income approach, which was based on significant inputs that are not observable in the market and thus represents a fair value measurement categorized within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. Key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows included projected revenue growth and operating expenses, as well as the selection of an appropriate discount rate. Estimates of revenue growth and operating expenses were based on internal projections and considered the historical performance of stores, local market economics and the business environments impacting store performance. The discount rate applied was based on East China's weighted-average cost of capital and included company-specific and size risk premiums. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed are reported within our International segment. Other current and long-term assets acquired primarily include lease deposits and prepaid rent. Accrued liabilities and other long-term liabilities assumed primarily include deferred income tax, dividend payable, accrued payroll, income tax payable and accrued occupancy costs. The definite-lived intangibles primarily relate to reacquired rights to operate stores exclusively in East China. The reacquired rights of $ 798.0 million represent the fair value calculated over the remaining original contractual period and will be amortized on a straight-line basis through September 2022 . Amortization expense for these definite-lived intangible assets was $ 163.8 million and $ 129.8 million for fiscal 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The estimated future amortization expense is approximately $ 157.8 million each year for the next two years and approximately $ 154.4 million in fiscal 2022. Goodwill represents the intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition and primarily includes the acquired customer base, the acquired workforce including store partners in the region that have strong relationships with these customers, and the existing geographic retail and online presence. The entire balance was allocated to the International segment and is not deductible for income tax purposes. Due to foreign currency translation, the balance of goodwill related to the acquisition decreased $ 190.6 million since the date of acquisition to $ 2.0 billion as of September 29, 2019. We began consolidating East China's results of operations and cash flows into our consolidated financial statements after December 31, 2017. For the year ended September 30, 2018 , East China's revenue included in our consolidated statements of earnings was $ 903.0 million . For the year ended September 30, 2018 , East China's net earnings included in our consolidated statements of earnings was $ 73.1 million . 61 Table of Contents The following table provides the supplemental pro forma revenue and net earnings of the combined entity had the acquisition date of East China been October 3, 2016, the first day of our first quarter of fiscal 2017, rather than the end of our first quarter of fiscal 2018 (in millions) : Year Ended Sep 30, 2018 Oct 1, 2017 (1) Revenue $ 24,990.4 $ 23,315.0 Net earnings attributable to Starbucks 3,196.8 4,209.0 (1) The pro forma net earnings attributable to Starbucks for fiscal 2017 includes acquisition-related gain of $ 1.4 billion and transaction and integration costs of $ 39.3 million for the year ended October 1, 2017. The amounts in the supplemental pro forma earnings for the periods presented above fully eliminate intercompany transactions, apply our accounting policies and reflect adjustments for additional occupancy costs as well as depreciation and amortization that would have been charged assuming the same fair value adjustments to leases, property, plant and equipment and acquired intangibles had been applied on October 3, 2016. These pro forma results are unaudited and are not necessarily indicative of results of operations that would have occurred had the acquisition actually closed in the prior period or indicative of the results of operations for any future period. During the year ended September 30, 2018, we incurred approximately $ 3.6 million of acquisition-related costs, such as regulatory, legal, and advisory fees, which were recorded in general and administrative expenses. In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, we sold the assets associated with our Tazo brand including Tazo ® signature recipes, intellectual property and inventory to Unilever for a total of $ 383.8 million . The transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $ 347.9 million , which was included in the net gain from divestiture of certain operations on our consolidated statements of earnings. Results from Tazo operations prior to the sale were reported primarily in Channel Development. Fiscal 2017 In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017, we sold our company-operated retail store assets and operations in Singapore to Maxim's Caterers Limited, converting these operations to a fully licensed market, for a total of $ 119.9 million . This transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $ 83.9 million , which was included in the net gain resulting from divestiture of certain operations on our consolidated statements of earnings. Note 3: Derivative Financial Instruments Interest Rates From time to time, we enter into designated cash flow hedges to manage the variability in cash flows due to changes in benchmark interest rates. We enter into interest rate swap agreements and treasury locks, which are synthetic forward sales of U.S. treasury securities settled in cash based upon the difference between an agreed-upon treasury rate and the prevailing treasury rate at settlement. These agreements are cash settled at the time of the pricing of the related debt. Each derivative agreement's gain or loss is recorded in AOCI and is subsequently reclassified to interest expense over the life of the related debt. To hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of our fixed-rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap agreements, which are designated as fair value hedges. The changes in fair values of these derivative instruments and the offsetting changes in fair values of the underlying hedged debt due to changes in the relevant benchmark interest rates are recorded in interest expense. Refer to Note 9 Debt, for additional information on our long-term debt. Foreign Currency To reduce cash flow volatility from foreign currency fluctuations, we enter into forward and swap contracts to hedge portions of cash flows of anticipated intercompany royalty payments, inventory purchases, and intercompany borrowing and lending activities. The resulting gains and losses from these derivatives are recorded in AOCI and subsequently reclassified to revenue, cost of sales, or interest income and other, net, respectively, when the hedged exposures affect net earnings. From time to time, we may enter into financial instruments, including but not limited to forward contracts or foreign currency-denominated debt, to hedge the currency exposure of our net investments in certain international operations. The resulting gains and losses from these derivatives are recorded in AOCI and are subsequently reclassified to net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. Foreign currency forward and swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments are used to mitigate the foreign exchange risk of certain other balance sheet items. Gains and losses from these derivatives are largely offset by the financial impact of 62 Table of Contents translating foreign currency-denominated payables and receivables; these gains and losses are recorded in interest income and other, net. Commodities Depending on market conditions, we may enter into coffee forward contracts, futures contracts, and collars to hedge anticipated cash flows under our price-to-be-fixed green coffee contracts, which are described further in Note 5 , Inventories, or our longer-dated forecasted coffee demand where underlying fixed price and price-to-be-fixed contracts are not yet available. The resulting gains and losses are recorded in AOCI and are subsequently reclassified to cost of sales when the hedged exposure affects net earnings. Depending on market conditions, we may also enter into dairy forward contracts and futures contracts to hedge a portion of anticipated cash flows under our dairy purchase contracts and our forecasted dairy demand. The resulting gains or losses are recorded in AOCI and are subsequently reclassified to cost of sales when the hedged exposure affects net earnings. To mitigate the price uncertainty of a portion of our future purchases, including dairy products, diesel fuel and other commodities, we enter into swap contracts, futures and collars that are not designated as hedging instruments. The resulting gains and losses are recorded in interest income and other, net to help offset price fluctuations on our beverage, food, packaging and transportation costs, which are included in cost of sales on our consolidated statements of earnings.

Available-for-sale Debt Securities Long-term investments generally mature within 4 years . Proceeds from sales of securities were $ 291.1 million , $ 459.0 million , and $ 999.7 million for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Realized gains and losses were not material for fiscal 2019 , 2018 , and 2017 . Gross unrealized holding gains and losses were not material as of September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018 . 67 Table of Contents Marketable Equity Securities Marketable equity securities include equity mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. Our marketable equity securities portfolio approximates a portion of our liability under our MDCP, a defined contribution plan. Our MDCP liability was $ 92.1 million and $ 102.2 million as of September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018 , respectively. The changes in net unrealized holding gains and losses in the marketable equity securities portfolio included in earnings for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 were not material. Gross unrealized holding gains and losses on marketable equity securities were not material as of September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018 . Derivative Assets and Liabilities Derivative assets and liabilities include foreign currency forward contracts, commodity futures contracts, collars and swaps, which are described further in Note 3 , Derivative Financial Instruments. Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis Assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include items such as property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets, equity and other investments, and other assets. These assets are measured at fair value if determined to be impaired. Impairment of property, plant, and equipment is included at Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Other than the impairments discussed in Note 8 , Other Intangible Assets and Goodwill, and the aforementioned fair value adjustments, there were no other material fair value adjustments during fiscal 2019 and 2018 . Fair Value of Other Financial Instruments The estimated fair value of our long-term debt based on the quoted market price (Level 2) is included at Note 9 , Debt. Note 5: Inventories (in millions) Sep 29, 2019 Sep 30, 2018 Coffee: Unroasted $ 656.5 $ 588.6 Roasted 276.5 281.2 Other merchandise held for sale 288.0 273.1 Packaging and other supplies 308.4 257.6 Total $ 1,529.4 $ 1,400.5 Other merchandise held for sale includes, among other items, serveware, food and tea. Inventory levels vary due to seasonality, commodity market supply and price fluctuations. As of September 29, 2019 , we had committed to purchasing green coffee totaling $ 854 million under fixed-price contracts and an estimated $ 203 million under price-to-be-fixed contracts. A portion of our price-to-be-fixed contacts are effectively fixed through the use of futures. See Note 3 , Derivative Financial Instruments for further discussion. Price-to-be-fixed contracts are purchase commitments whereby the quality, quantity, delivery period and other negotiated terms are agreed upon, but the date, and therefore the price, at which the base “C” coffee commodity price component will be fixed has not yet been established. For most contracts, either Starbucks or the seller has the option to “fix” the base “C” coffee commodity price prior to the delivery date. For other contracts, Starbucks and the seller may agree upon pricing parameters determined by the base “C” coffee commodity price. Until prices are fixed, we estimate the total cost of these purchase commitments. We believe, based on relationships established with our suppliers in the past, the risk of non-delivery on these purchase commitments is remote. Note 6: Equity Investments (in millions) Sep 29, 2019 Sep 30, 2018 Equity method investments $ 336.1 $ 296.0 Other investments 59.9 38.7 Total $ 396.0 $ 334.7 Equity Method Investments As of September 29, 2019 , we had 50 % ownership interests in Starbucks Coffee Korea Co., Ltd. and Tata Starbucks Limited (India). These international entities operate licensed Starbucks ® retail stores. Additional disclosure regarding changes in our 68 Table of Contents equity method investments due to acquisition or divestiture is included at Note 2 , Acquisitions, Divestitures and Strategic Alliance. We also license the rights to produce and distribute Starbucks-branded products to our 50 % owned joint venture, The North American Coffee Partnership with the Pepsi-Cola Company, which develops and distributes bottled Starbucks ® beverages, including Frappuccino ® coffee drinks, Starbucks Doubleshot ® espresso drinks, Starbucks Refreshers ® beverages, and Starbucks ® Iced Espresso Classics. Our share of income and losses from our equity method investments is included in income from equity investees on our consolidated statements of earnings. Also included in this line item is our proportionate share of gross profit resulting from coffee and other product sales to, and royalty and license fee revenues generated from, equity investees. Revenues generated from these related parties were $ 130.7 million , $ 112.8 million , and $ 187.3 million in fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Related costs of sales were $ 73.2 million , $ 71.5 million , and $ 109.3 million in fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. As of September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018 , there were $ 35.5 million and $ 41.2 million of accounts receivable from equity investees, respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets, primarily related to product sales and royalty revenues. Other Investments We have equity interests in entities that develop and operate Starbucks licensed stores in several global markets, as well as in companies that support our strategic initiatives. We do not have significant influence over these entities and their fair values are not readily determinable. Therefore, we elected to measure these investments at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairment.

For both fiscal 2019 and 2018, ""Other"" also includes foreign currency translation. During fiscal 2018, a strengthening Swiss franc diverted consumer traffic to neighboring countries and despite our operational investments and improvements, projections indicated that the carrying value of Switzerland goodwill balance was not fully recoverable. This resulted in an impairment charge for the remaining Switzerland goodwill balance of $ 37.6 million . During the third quarter of fiscal 2017, management finalized its long-term strategy for the Teavana reporting unit, which included closing all Teavana-branded retail stores. As a result, we recorded store asset impairment of $ 33.0 million and goodwill impairment of $ 69.3 million , reducing goodwill of the Teavana reporting unit to $ 398.3 million as of July 2, 2017. During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we dissolved the Teavana reporting unit upon completion of the retail store closures. As a result, we reorganized the Teavana business and allocated the remaining $ 398.3 million of goodwill to other reporting units, primarily within the Americas segment, based on a relative fair value approach.

Note 9: Debt Revolving Credit Facility and Commercial Paper Program Our $ 2.0 billion unsecured 5-year revolving credit facility (the “2018 credit facility”) and a $ 1.0 billion unsecured 364-Day credit facility (the “364-day credit facility”) are available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases. The 2018 credit facility, of which $ 150 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit, is currently set to mature on October 25, 2022 . We have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $ 500 million . Borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR, and, for U.S. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on the better of (i) the Company's long-term credit ratings assigned by Moody's and Standard & Poor's rating agencies and (ii) the Company's fixed charge coverage ratio, pursuant to a pricing grid set forth in the five-year credit agreement. The current applicable margin is 0.910 % for Eurocurrency Rate Loans and 0.000 % (nil) for Base Rate Loans. The 364-day credit facility, of which no amount may be used for issuances of letters of credit, has been extended to mature on October 21, 2020 . We have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $ 500 million . Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR, and, for U.S. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin was 0.920 % for Eurocurrency Rate Loans and 0.000 % (nil) for Base Rate Loans. Both credit facilities contain provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which measures our ability to cover financing expenses. As of September 29, 2019, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. No amounts were outstanding under our credit facility as of September 29, 2019 . Under our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $ 3.0 billion , with individual maturities that may vary but not exceed 397 days from the date of issue.

As of September 29, 2019 , 29.2 million shares remained available for repurchase under current authorizations. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 , our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend to shareholders of $ 0.41 per share to be paid on November 29, 2019 to shareholders of record as of the close of business on November 13, 2019 . Comprehensive Income Comprehensive income includes all changes in equity during the period, except those resulting from transactions with our shareholders.

Note 12: Employee Stock and Benefit Plans We maintain several equity incentive plans under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) or stock appreciation rights to employees, non-employee directors and consultants. We issue new shares of common stock upon exercise of stock options and the vesting of RSUs. We also have an employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”). As of September 29, 2019 , there were 52.6 million shares of common stock available for issuance pursuant to future equity-based compensation awards and 12.4 million shares available for issuance under our ESPP. Stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements (in millions) : Fiscal Year Ended Sep 29, 2019 Sep 30, 2018 Oct 1, 2017 Options $ 20.0 $ 28.0 $ 44.3 RSUs 288.0 222.3 131.7 Total stock-based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings $ 308.0 $ 250.3 $ 176.0 Total related tax benefit $ 59.3 $ 62.4 $ 57.6 Total capitalized stock-based compensation included in net property, plant and equipment and inventories on the consolidated balance sheets $ 3.4 $ 3.5 $ 1.9 Stock Option Plans We provide stock options as a form of employee compensation, which are primarily time-vested. The majority of time-vested options become exercisable in four equal installments beginning a year from the grant date and generally expire 10 years from the grant date. Options granted to non-employee directors generally vest immediately or one year from grant. All outstanding stock options are non-qualified stock options. 75 Table of Contents The fair value of stock option awards was estimated at the grant date with the following weighted average assumptions for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 : Employee Stock Options Granted During the Period Fiscal Year Ended 2019 2018 2017 Expected term (in years) 4.1 3.6 3.9 Expected stock price volatility 21.6 % 20.5 % 21.6 % Risk-free interest rate 2.9 % 2.1 % 1.5 % Expected dividend yield 2.1 % 2.2 % 1.8 % Weighted average grant price $ 67.33 $ 56.56 $ 56.12 Estimated fair value per option granted $ 11.06 $ 7.32 $ 8.56 The expected term of the options represents the estimated period of time until exercise and is based on historical experience of similar awards, giving consideration to the contractual terms, vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior. Expected stock price volatility is based on a combination of historical volatility of our stock and the one-year implied volatility of Starbucks traded options, for the related vesting periods. The risk-free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term. The dividend yield assumption is based on our anticipated cash dividend payouts. The amounts shown above for the estimated fair value per option granted are before the estimated effect of forfeitures, which reduce the amount of expense recorded in the consolidated statements of earnings.

As of September 29, 2019 , total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to nonvested options was approximately $ 5 million , before income taxes, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 1.6 years . The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $ 466 million , $ 236 million , and $ 181 million during fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The total fair value of options vested was $ 31 million , $ 53 million , and $ 40 million during fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. RSUs We have both time-vested and performance-based RSUs. Time-vested RSUs are awarded to eligible employees and entitle the grantee to receive shares of common stock at the end of a vesting period, subject solely to the employee’s continuing employment. The time-vested RSUs either vest in two or four equal annual installments beginning a year from the grant date. Our performance-based RSUs are awarded to eligible employees and entitle the grantee to receive shares of common stock if we achieve specified performance goals during the performance period and the grantee remains employed through the vesting period. 76 Table of Contents RSU transactions for the year ended September 29, 2019 (in millions, except per share and contractual life amounts) : Number of Shares Weighted Average Grant Date Fair Value per Share Weighted Average Remaining Contractual Life (Years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value Nonvested, September 30, 2018 11.2 $ 55.62 1.0 $ 636 Granted 4.6 68.14 Vested ( 4.6 ) 55.71 Forfeited/canceled ( 2.3 ) 59.88 Nonvested, September 29, 2019 8.9 62.56 1.1 788 For fiscal 2018 and 2017 , the weighted average fair value per RSU granted was $ 56.48 and $ 54.30 , respectively. As of September 29, 2019 , total unrecogniz ed stock-based compensation expense related to nonvested RSUs, net of estimated forfeitures, was approximately $ 165 million , before income taxes, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately 2.0 years . The total fair value of RSUs vested was $ 255 million , $ 166 million and $ 182 million during fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. ESPP Our ESPP allows eligible employees to contribute up to 10 % of their base earnings toward the quarterly purchase of our common stock, subject to an annual maximum dollar amount. The purchase price is 95 % of the fair market value of the stock on the last business day of the quarterly offering period. The number of shares issued under our ESPP was 0.4 million in fiscal 2019 . Deferred Compensation Plan We have a Deferred Compensation Plan for Non-Employee Directors under which non-employee directors may, for any fiscal year, irrevocably elect to defer receipt of shares of common stock the director would have received upon vesting of restricted stock units. The number of deferred shares outstanding related to deferrals made under this plan is not material. Defined Contribution Plans We maintain voluntary defined contribution plans, both qualified and non-qualified, covering eligible employees as defined in the plan documents. Participating employees may elect to defer and contribute a portion of their eligible compensation to the plans up to limits stated in the plan documents, not to exceed the dollar amounts set by applicable laws. Our matching contributions to all U.S. and non-U.S. plans were $ 122.1 million , $ 111.7 million and $ 101.4 million in fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. Note 13: Income Taxes On December 22, 2017, the President of the United States signed and enacted comprehensive tax legislation into law H.R. 1, commonly referred to as the Tax Act. Except for certain provisions, the Tax Act is effective for tax years beginning on or after January 1, 2018. The tax rate for fiscal 2019 and future years was reduced to 21 % from our blended 24.5 % in fiscal 2018. In the first quarter of fiscal 2019 the measurement period related to the Tax Act concluded, which resulted in immaterial adjustments to our provisional estimates. While the Tax Act provides for a modified territorial tax system, global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) provisions are applied providing an incremental tax on foreign income. We have made a policy election to classify taxes due under the GILTI provision as a current period expense.

This change did not have a material impact to our financial results. As of September 29, 2019, in foreign subsidiaries in which we are partially indefinitely reinvested, the gross taxable temporary difference between the accounting basis and tax basis was approximately $1.3 billion, for which there could be up to approximately $300 million of unrecognized tax liability. 78 Table of Contents Tax effect of temporary differences and carryforwards that comprise significant portions of deferred tax assets and liabilities (in millions): Sep 29, 2019 Sep 30, 2018 Deferred tax assets: Property, plant and equipment $ 66.5 $ 67.4 Intangible assets and goodwill 230.0 — Accrued occupancy costs 121.6 109.0 Accrued compensation and related costs 62.7 64.2 Stored value card liability and deferred revenue 1,649.0 144.2 Stock-based compensation 77.5 96.7 Net operating losses 75.6 79.2 Other 130.7 129.5 Total $ 2,413.6 $ 690.2 Valuation allowance ( 75.1 ) ( 129.3 ) Total deferred tax asset, net of valuation allowance $ 2,338.5 $ 560.9 Deferred tax liabilities: Property, plant and equipment ( 400.9 ) ( 348.1 ) Intangible assets and goodwill ( 209.9 ) ( 274.2 ) Other ( 148.3 ) ( 74.1 ) Total ( 759.1 ) ( 696.4 ) Net deferred tax asset (liability) $ 1,579.4 $ ( 135.5 ) Reported as: Deferred income tax assets 1,765.8 134.7 Deferred income tax liabilities (included in Other long-term liabilities) ( 186.4 ) ( 270.2 ) Net deferred tax asset (liability) $ 1,579.4 $ ( 135.5 ) The valuation allowance as of September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018 was primarily related to net operating losses and other deferred tax assets of consolidated foreign subsidiaries.

Uncertain Tax Positions As of September 29, 2019 , we had $ 132.1 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits of which $ 113.2 million , if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. We recognized a benefit of $ 2.8 million , a benefit of $ 0.5 million and an expense of $ 5.2 million of interest and penalties in income tax expense, prior to the benefit of the federal tax deduction, for fiscal 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively. As of September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018 , we had accrued interest and penalties of $ 10.0 million and $ 12.8 million , respectively, within our consolidated balance sheets. 79 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the activity related to our unrecognized tax benefits (in millions) : Sep 29, 2019 Sep 30, 2018 Oct 1, 2017 Beginning balance $ 224.6 $ 196.9 $ 146.5 Increase related to prior year tax positions 3.8 17.5 10.4 Decrease related to prior year tax positions ( 75.3 ) ( 41.8 ) — Increase related to current year tax positions 18.5 62.4 41.3 Decreases related to settlements with taxing authorities ( 16.4 ) ( 4.5 ) — Decrease related to lapsing of statute of limitations ( 23.1 ) ( 5.9 ) ( 1.3 ) Ending balance $ 132.1 $ 224.6 $ 196.9 We are currently under examination, or may be subject to examination, by various U.S. federal, state, local and foreign tax jurisdictions for fiscal 2008 through 2018. We are no longer subject to U.S. federal examination for years prior to fiscal 2016. We are no longer subject to U.S. state examination for years prior to fiscal 2011. We are no longer subject to examination in any material international markets prior to 2008. It is reasonably possible that up to $ 29 million of the Company's gross unrecognized tax benefits may be recognized by the end of fiscal 2020 for reasons such as a lapse of the statute of limitations or resolution of examinations with tax authorities.

The calculation of dilutive shares outstanding excludes out-of-the-money stock options (i.e., such options’ exercise prices were greater than the average market price of our common shares for the period) because their inclusion would have been antidilutive. As of September 29, 2019 , we had no out-of-the-money stock options, compared to 14.1 million and 11.4 million as of September 30, 2018 and October 1, 2017 , respectively. Note 15: Commitments and Contingencies Legal Proceedings On April 13, 2010, an organization named Council for Education and Research on Toxics (“Plaintiff”) filed a lawsuit in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles, against the Company and certain other defendants who manufacture, package, distribute or sell brewed coffee. The lawsuit is Council for Education and Research on Toxics v. Starbucks Corporation, et al . On May 9, 2011, the Plaintiff filed an additional lawsuit in the Superior Court of the State of California, County of Los Angeles, against the Company and additional defendants who manufacture, package, distribute or sell packaged coffee. The lawsuit is Council for Education and Research on Toxics v. Brad Barry LLC, et al .. Both cases have since been consolidated and now include nearly eighty defendants, which constitute the great majority of the coffee industry in California. Plaintiff alleges that the Company and the other defendants failed to provide warnings for their coffee products of exposure to the chemical acrylamide as required under California Health and Safety Code section 25249.5, the California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, better known as Proposition 65. Plaintiff seeks equitable relief, including providing warnings to consumers of coffee products, as well as civil penalties in the amount of the statutory maximum of two thousand five hundred dollars per day per violation of Proposition 65. The Plaintiff asserts that every consumed cup of coffee, absent a compliant warning, is equivalent to a violation under Proposition 65. The Company, as part of a joint defense group organized to defend against the lawsuit, disputes the claims of the Plaintiff. Acrylamide is not added to coffee but is present in all coffee in small amounts (parts per billion) as a byproduct of the coffee 80 Table of Contents bean roasting process. The Company has asserted multiple affirmative defenses. Trial of the first phase of the case commenced on September 8, 2014, and was limited to three affirmative defenses shared by all defendants. On September 1, 2015, the trial court issued a final ruling adverse to defendants on all Phase 1 defenses. Trial of the second phase of the case commenced in the fall of 2017. On May 7, 2018, the trial court issued a ruling adverse to defendants on the Phase 2 defense, the Company's last remaining defense to liability. On June 22, 2018, the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) proposed a new regulation clarifying that cancer warnings are not required for coffee under Proposition 65. The case was set to proceed to a third phase trial on damages, remedies and attorneys' fees on October 15, 2018. However, on October 12, 2018, the California Court of Appeal granted the defendants request for a stay of the Phase 3 trial. On June 3, 2019, the Office of Administrative Law (OAL) approved the coffee exemption regulation. The regulation will be effective on October 1, 2019. On June 24, 2019, the Court of Appeal lifted the stay of the litigation. A status conference before the trial judge to discuss discovery issues and dispositive motions is scheduled for January 21, 2020. At this stage of the proceedings, Starbucks believes that the likelihood that the Company will ultimately incur a loss in connection with this litigation is less than reasonably possible. Accordingly, no loss contingency was recorded for this matter. Starbucks is party to various other legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including certain employment litigation cases that have been certified as class or collective actions, but, except as noted above, is not currently a party to any legal proceeding that management believes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Note 16: Segment Reporting Segment information is prepared on the same basis that our ceo, who is our Chief Operating Decision Maker, manages the segments, evaluates financial results, and makes key operating decisions. We have three reportable operating segments: 1) Americas, which is inclusive of the U.S., Canada, and Latin America; 2) International, which is inclusive of China, Japan, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East, and Africa; and 3) Channel Development. Americas and International operations sell coffee and other beverages, complementary food, packaged coffees, single-serve coffee products and a focused selection of merchandise through company-operated stores and licensed stores. Our Americas segment is our most mature business and has achieved significant scale. Channel Development revenues include packaged coffee sales, tea and ready-to-drink beverages to customers outside of our company-operated and licensed stores. Historically revenues have included domestic and international sales of our packaged coffee, tea and ready-to-drink products to grocery, warehouse club and specialty retail stores and through institutional foodservice companies which serviced businesses. Since the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, most of our Channel Development revenues are from product sales to and royalty revenues from Nestlé. The collaborative business relationships for ready-to-drink products and the associated revenues remain unchanged due to the Global Coffee Alliance.

Revenues are shown based on the geographic location of our customers. Revenues from countries other than the U.S. consist primarily of revenues from China, Japan, Canada and the U.K., which together account for approximately 83 % of net revenues from other countries for fiscal 2019 . Management evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net revenues and operating income. The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in Note 1 , Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Operating income represents earnings before other income and expenses and income taxes. The identifiable assets by segment disclosed in this note are those assets specifically identifiable within each segment and include cash and cash equivalents, net property, plant and equipment, equity and cost investments, goodwill, and other intangible assets. Assets not attributed to reportable operating segments are corporate assets and are primarily comprised of cash and cash equivalents available for general corporate purposes, investments, assets of the corporate headquarters and roasting facilities, and inventory.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 29, 2019 and September 30, 2018, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 15, 2019, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion. Critical Audit Matter The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates. Goodwill - China Company-Operated Reporting Unit - Refer to Notes 1 and 8 to the financial statements Critical Audit Matter Description We identified goodwill for the China company-operated reporting unit (“China”) as a critical audit matter. The Company’s evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. The Company uses a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit, which requires management to make subjective estimates and assumptions, particularly related to the forecast of future revenues. The total goodwill balance of the International Segment was $2,958.4 million as of September 29, 2019, of which the majority was allocated to China. The sensitivity of operating results in China to changes in market risk factors, such as economic conditions, regulatory environment, and competition, required the application of a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions related to the forecast of future revenues. How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our principal audit procedures related to the Company’s forecast of future revenues used by management to estimate the fair value of China included the following, among others: • We tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s goodwill impairment evaluation, including the controls related to management’s forecast of future revenues 84 Table of Contents • We evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast future revenues by comparing actual results to management’s historical forecast • We assessed the reasonableness of the forecast of future revenues by comparing the forecast to: - Historical revenues - Internal communications to management and the Board of Directors - Forecast information included in analyst and industry reports for the Company - Historical and forecast information included in macro-economic reports for the China market - Subsequent forecasts, to evaluate for changes made by management since the annual measurement date through issuance of the financial statements. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Seattle, Washington November 15, 2019 We have served as the Company's auditor since 1987. 85 Table of Contents Item 9. Changes in and Disagreements with Accountants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure Not applicable. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures Disclosure Controls and Procedures We maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that material information required to be disclosed in our periodic reports filed or submitted under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms. Our disclosure controls and procedures are also designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 , we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective, as of the end of the period covered by this report ( September 29, 2019 ). There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Exchange Act) during our most recently completed fiscal quarter that materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect internal control over financial reporting. The certifications required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 are filed as exhibits 31.1 and 31.2 , respectively, to this 10-K. Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of our financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Internal control over financial reporting includes maintaining records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect our transactions; providing reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary for preparation of our financial statements; providing reasonable assurance that receipts and expenditures are made in accordance with management authorization; and providing reasonable assurance that unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of company assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements would be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that a misstatement of our financial statements would be prevented or detected. Management conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework and criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework , issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. This evaluation included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of September 29, 2019 . Our internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2019 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein. 86 Table of Contents REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM To the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Starbucks Corporation Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Starbucks Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of September 29, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2019, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended September 29, 2019, of the Company and our report dated November 15, 2019, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Report of Management on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP Seattle, Washington November 15, 2019 87 Table of Contents Item 9B.
