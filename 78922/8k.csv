(NYSE: PFE) and Array BioPharma Inc. (NASDAQ: ARRY) today announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement under which Pfizer will acquire Array, a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of targeted small molecule medicines to treat cancer and other diseases of high unmet need. Pfizer has agreed to acquire Array for $48 per share in cash, for a total enterprise value of approximately $11.4 billion. The Boards of Directors of both companies have approved the merger. Arrays portfolio includes the approved combined use of BRAFTOVI ® (encorafenib) and MEKTOVI ® (binimetinib) for the treatment of BRAF V600E or BRAF V600K mutant unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The combination therapy has significant potential for long-term growth via expansion into additional areas of unmet need and is currently being investigated in over 30 clinical trials across several solid tumor indications, including the Phase 3 BEACON trial in BRAF- mutant metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). In the U.S., colorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer in men and women. An estimated 140,250 patients were diagnosed with cancer of the colon or rectum in 2018, and approximately 50,000 are estimated to die of their disease each year. i BRAF mutations are estimated to occur in up to 15% of colorectal cancer cases and represent a poor prognosis for these patients. Todays announcement reinforces our commitment to deploy our capital to bring breakthroughs that change patients lives while creating shareholder value, said Albert Bourla, chief executive officer of Pfizer. The proposed acquisition of Array strengthens our innovative biopharmaceutical business, is expected to enhance its long-term growth trajectory, and sets the stage to create a potentially industry-leading franchise for colorectal cancer alongside Pfizers existing expertise in breast and prostate cancers. In addition to the combination therapy for BRAF -mutant metastatic melanoma, Array brings a broad pipeline of targeted cancer medicines in development, as well as a portfolio of out-licensed potentially best-in-class and/or first-in-class medicines, which are expected to generate significant royalties over time. We are incredibly proud that Pfizer has recognized the value Array has brought to patients and our remarkable legacy discovering and advancing molecules with great potential to impact and extend the lives of patients in critical need, said Ron Squarer, Array chief executive officer. Pfizer shares our commitment to patients and a passion for advancing science to develop even more options for individuals with unmet needs. Were excited our team will have access to world-class resources and a broader research platform to continue this critical work. In May 2019, Array announced results from the interim analysis of the Phase 3 BEACON mCRC trial: The second-or-third-line treatment with the BRAFTOVI triplet combination (BRAFTOVI + MEKTOVI + cetuximab) showed statistically significant improvement in overall response rate and overall survival compared to the control group, reducing the risk of death by 48%. The triplet combination could be the first chemotherapy-free, targeted regimen for patients with BRAF -mutant mCRC. Array intends to submit these data for regulatory review in the United States in the second half of 2019. 2 We are very excited by Arrays impressive track record of successfully discovering and developing innovative small-molecules and targeted cancer therapies, said Mikael Dolsten, Pfizer chief scientific officer and president, Worldwide Research, Development and Medical. With Arrays exceptional scientific talent and innovative pipeline, combined with Pfizers leading research and development capabilities, we reinforce our commitment to advancing the most promising science, regardless of whether it is found inside or outside of our labs. Upon the close of the transaction, Arrays employees will join Pfizer and continue to be located in Cambridge, Massachusetts and Morrisville, North Carolina, as well as Boulder, Colorado, which becomes part of Pfizers Oncology Research & Development network in addition to La Jolla, California and Pearl River, New York. Pfizer expects to finance the majority of the transaction with debt and the balance with existing cash. The transaction is expected to be dilutive to Pfizers Adjusted Diluted EPS by $0.04 -$0.05 in 2019, $0.04 -$0.05 in 2020, neutral in 2021, and accretive beginning in 2022, with additional accretion and growth anticipated thereafter. Pfizer will provide any appropriate updates to its current 2019 guidance in conjunction with its third quarter 2019 earnings release. Under the terms of the merger agreement, a subsidiary of Pfizer will commence a cash tender offer to purchase all outstanding shares of Array common stock for $48 per share in cash for a total enterprise value of approximately $11.4 billion. The closing of the tender offer is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the tender of a majority of the outstanding shares of Array common stock (on a fully-diluted basis). The merger agreement contemplates that Pfizer will acquire any shares of Array that are not tendered into the offer through a second-step merger, which will be completed promptly following the closing of the tender offer. Pfizer expects to complete the acquisition in the second half of 2019. Pfizers financial advisors for the transaction were Guggenheim Securities, LLC, and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, with Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz acting as its legal advisor. Centerview Partners served as Arrays exclusive financial advisor, while Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP served as its legal advisor.

A further description of risks and uncertainties relating to Pfizer and Array can be found in Pfizers Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 and in Arrays Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018, respectively, and in their subsequent Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K, all of which are filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) and available at www.sec.gov . Pfizer calculates projections regarding the expected dilutive and accretive impact of the potential acquisition based on internal forecasts of Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share (Adjusted Diluted EPS), which forecasts are non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) financial measures derived by excluding certain amounts that would be included in GAAP calculations. These dilution/accretion projections should not be considered a substitute for GAAP measures. The determinations of the amounts that are excluded from the dilution/accretion calculations are a matter of management judgment and depend upon, among other factors, the nature of the underlying expense or income amounts. Pfizer is unable to present quantitative reconciliations because management cannot reasonably predict with reasonable certainty all of the necessary components of the comparable GAAP 5 measure (such as the ultimate outcome of pending litigation, unusual or significant gains and losses, acquisition-related expenses, net gains or losses on investments in equity securities and potential future asset impairments) without unreasonable effort. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on GAAP Reported results for the relevant periods. Pfizer has excluded from the dilution/accretion calculations the impact of purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certain significant items. Such items can have a substantial impact on GAAP measures of financial performance. For more information on the Adjusted Diluted EPS measure see Pfizers 2018 Financial Report, which was filed as exhibit 13 to Pfizers Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018 and Pfizers Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2019.

(NYSE: PFE) and Array BioPharma Inc. (NASDAQ: ARRY) today announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement under which Pfizer will acquire Array, a commercial stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of targeted small molecule medicines to treat cancer and other diseases of high unmet need. Pfizer has agreed to acquire Array for $48 per share in cash, for a total enterprise value of approximately $11.4 billion. The Boards of Directors of both companies have approved the merger. Arrays portfolio includes the approved combined use of BRAFTOVI ® (encorafenib) and MEKTOVI ® (binimetinib) for the treatment of BRAF V600E or BRAF V600K mutant unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The combination therapy has significant potential for long-term growth via expansion into additional areas of unmet need and is currently being investigated in over 30 clinical trials across several solid tumor indications, including the Phase 3 BEACON trial in BRAF- mutant metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). In the U.S., colorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer in men and women. An estimated 140,250 patients were diagnosed with cancer of the colon or rectum in 2018, and approximately 50,000 are estimated to die of their disease each year. i BRAF mutations are estimated to occur in up to 15% of colorectal cancer cases and represent a poor prognosis for these patients. Todays announcement reinforces our commitment to deploy our capital to bring breakthroughs that change patients lives while creating shareholder value, said Albert Bourla, chief executive officer of Pfizer. The proposed acquisition of Array strengthens our innovative biopharmaceutical business, is expected to enhance its long-term growth trajectory, and sets the stage to create a potentially industry-leading franchise for colorectal cancer alongside Pfizers existing expertise in breast and prostate cancers. In addition to the combination therapy for BRAF -mutant metastatic melanoma, Array brings a broad pipeline of targeted cancer medicines in development, as well as a portfolio of out-licensed potentially best-in-class and/or first-in-class medicines, which are expected to generate significant royalties over time. We are incredibly proud that Pfizer has recognized the value Array has brought to patients and our remarkable legacy discovering and advancing molecules with great potential to impact and extend the lives of patients in critical need, said Ron Squarer, Array chief executive officer. Pfizer shares our commitment to patients and a passion for advancing science to develop even more options for individuals with unmet needs. Were excited our team will have access to world-class resources and a broader research platform to continue this critical work. In May 2019, Array announced results from the interim analysis of the Phase 3 BEACON mCRC trial: The second-or-third-line treatment with the BRAFTOVI triplet combination (BRAFTOVI + MEKTOVI + cetuximab) showed statistically significant improvement in overall response rate and overall survival compared to the control group, reducing the risk of death by 48%. The triplet combination could be the first chemotherapy-free, targeted regimen for patients with BRAF -mutant mCRC. Array intends to submit these data for regulatory review in the United States in the second half of 2019. 2 We are very excited by Arrays impressive track record of successfully discovering and developing innovative small-molecules and targeted cancer therapies, said Mikael Dolsten, Pfizer chief scientific officer and president, Worldwide Research, Development and Medical. With Arrays exceptional scientific talent and innovative pipeline, combined with Pfizers leading research and development capabilities, we reinforce our commitment to advancing the most promising science, regardless of whether it is found inside or outside of our labs. Upon the close of the transaction, Arrays employees will join Pfizer and continue to be located in Cambridge, Massachusetts and Morrisville, North Carolina, as well as Boulder, Colorado, which becomes part of Pfizers Oncology Research & Development network in addition to La Jolla, California and Pearl River, New York. Pfizer expects to finance the majority of the transaction with debt and the balance with existing cash. The transaction is expected to be dilutive to Pfizers Adjusted Diluted EPS by $0.04 -$0.05 in 2019, $0.04 -$0.05 in 2020, neutral in 2021, and accretive beginning in 2022, with additional accretion and growth anticipated thereafter. Pfizer will provide any appropriate updates to its current 2019 guidance in conjunction with its third quarter 2019 earnings release. Under the terms of the merger agreement, a subsidiary of Pfizer will commence a cash tender offer to purchase all outstanding shares of Array common stock for $48 per share in cash for a total enterprise value of approximately $11.4 billion. The closing of the tender offer is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory approvals and the tender of a majority of the outstanding shares of Array common stock (on a fully-diluted basis). The merger agreement contemplates that Pfizer will acquire any shares of Array that are not tendered into the offer through a second-step merger, which will be completed promptly following the closing of the tender offer. Pfizer expects to complete the acquisition in the second half of 2019. Pfizers financial advisors for the transaction were Guggenheim Securities, LLC, and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, with Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz acting as its legal advisor. Centerview Partners served as Arrays exclusive financial advisor, while Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP served as its legal advisor.

Pfizer calculates projections regarding the expected dilutive and accretive impact of the potential acquisition based on internal forecasts of Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share (Adjusted Diluted EPS), which forecasts are non-Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) financial measures derived by excluding certain amounts that would be included in GAAP calculations. These dilution/accretion projections should not be considered a substitute for GAAP measures. The determinations of the amounts that are excluded from the dilution/accretion calculations are a matter of management judgment and depend upon, among other factors, the nature of the underlying expense or income amounts.

These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could have a material impact on GAAP Reported results for the relevant periods. Pfizer has excluded from the dilution/accretion calculations the impact of purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and certain significant items.
