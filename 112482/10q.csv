NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Organization. Visa Inc., together with its subsidiaries (Visa or the Company), is a global payments technology company that facilitates global commerce and money movement across more than 200 countries and territories. Visa operates one of the world’s largest electronic payments networks — VisaNet — which provides transaction processing services (primarily authorization, clearing and settlement). The Company offers products, solutions and services that facilitate secure, reliable and efficient money movement for participants in the ecosystem. Visa is not a financial institution and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders of Visa products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, Visa’s financial institution clients. Consolidation and basis of presentation. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The Company consolidates its majority-owned and controlled entities, including variable interest entities (VIEs) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company’s investments in VIEs have not been material to its unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirements for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and, consequently, do not include all of the annual disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. Reference should be made to Visa’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2023 for additional disclosures, including a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. Use of estimates. The preparation of the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained, and will be recognized in the period in which such changes occur. Future actual results could differ materially from these estimates. Note 2—Acquisitions On January 16, 2024, Visa acquired Pismo Holdings, a global cloud-native issuer processing and core banking platform, for $ 1.0 billion in cash. Due to the limited amount of time since the acquisition date, the initial allocation of the purchase price is not yet complete. The Company expects to provide the initial purchase price allocation within its Form 10-Q for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. 9 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) Note 3—Revenues The nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of the Company’s revenues and cash flows and how they are affected by economic factors are most appropriately depicted through the Company’s revenue categories and geographical markets. The following tables disaggregate the Company’s net revenues by revenue category and by geography: Three Months Ended December 31, 2023 2022 (in millions) Service revenues $ 3,915 $ 3,511 Data processing revenues 4,356 3,827 International transaction revenues 3,019 2,797 Other revenues 692 587 Client incentives ( 3,348 ) ( 2,786 ) Net revenues $ 8,634 $ 7,936 Three Months Ended December 31, 2023 2022 (in millions) U.S. $ 3,645 $ 3,567 International 4,989 4,369 Net revenues $ 8,634 $ 7,936 Remaining performance obligations are comprised of deferred revenues and contract revenues that will be invoiced and recognized as revenues in future periods primarily related to value added services. As of December 31, 2023, the remaining performance obligations were $ 3.2 billion. The Company expects approximately half to be recognized as revenues in the next two years and the remaining thereafter. However, the amount and timing of revenue recognition is affected by several factors, including contract modifications and terminations, which could impact the estimate of amounts allocated to remaining performance obligations and when such revenues could be recognized. Note 4—Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents The Company reconciles cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents reported on the consolidated balance sheets that aggregate to the beginning and ending balances shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows as follows: December 31, 2023 September 30, 2023 (in millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 13,591 $ 16,286 Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents: U.S. litigation escrow 1,616 1,764 Customer collateral 3,164 3,005 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 1,265 935 Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents $ 19,636 $ 21,990 10 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan Under the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Company maintains an escrow account from which settlements of, or judgments in, certain litigation (U.S. covered litigation) are paid. The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the U.S. litigation escrow account balance. See Note 13—Legal Matters . The following table presents the changes in the restricted cash equivalents—U.S. litigation escrow account: Three Months Ended December 31, 2023 2022 (in millions) Balance as of beginning of period $ 1,764 $ 1,449 Deposits into the U.S. litigation escrow account — 350 Payments to opt-out merchants (1) , net of interest earned on escrow funds ( 148 ) ( 94 ) Balance as of end of period $ 1,616 $ 1,705 (1) These payments are associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. See Note 13—Legal Matters . Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plan Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rates in the Visa Europe territory (VE territory covered litigation). Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover certain losses resulting from VE territory covered litigation (VE territory covered losses) through a periodic adjustment to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the series B and C preferred stock. VE territory covered losses are recorded in the contra-equity account right to recover for covered losses within stockholders’ equity before the corresponding adjustment to the applicable conversion rate is effected. Adjustments to the conversion rate may be executed once in any six-month period unless a single, individual loss greater than € 20 million is incurred, in which case, the six-month limitation does not apply. When the adjustment to the conversion rate is made, the amount previously recorded in right to recover for covered losses is then recorded against the book value of the preferred stock within stockholders’ equity. The following table presents the activities related to VE territory covered losses in preferred stock and right to recover for covered losses within stockholders’ equity: Three Months Ended December 31, 2023 Preferred Stock Right to Recover for Covered Losses Series B Series C (in millions) Balance as of beginning of period $ 441 $ 801 $ ( 140 ) VE territory covered losses incurred (1) — — ( 24 ) Recovery through conversion rate adjustment ( 22 ) ( 3 ) 25 Balance as of end of period $ 419 $ 798 $ ( 139 ) 11 Table of Contents VISA INC.

See Note 13—Legal Matters . (2) Adjustment to right to recover for covered losses for the conversion rate adjustment differs from the actual recovered amount due to differences in foreign exchange rates between the time the losses were incurred and the subsequent recovery through the conversion rate adjustment. The following table presents the as-converted value of the preferred stock available to recover VE territory covered losses compared to the book value of preferred stock recorded within the Company’s consolidated balance sheets: December 31, 2023 September 30, 2023 As-converted Value of Preferred Stock (1),(2) Book Value of Preferred Stock (1) As-converted Value of Preferred Stock (1),(3) Book Value of Preferred Stock (1) (in millions) Series B preferred stock $ 1,875 $ 419 $ 1,676 $ 441 Series C preferred stock 2,979 798 2,635 801 Total 4,854 1,217 4,311 1,242 Less: right to recover for covered losses ( 139 ) ( 139 ) ( 140 ) ( 140 ) Total recovery for covered losses available $ 4,715 $ 1,078 $ 4,171 $ 1,102 (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

Money market funds, U.S. Treasury securities and marketable equity securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The Company’s deferred compensation liability is measured at fair value based on marketable equity securities held under the deferred compensation plan. Level 2 assets and liabilities. The fair value of U.S. government-sponsored debt securities, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. Derivative instruments are valued using inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. U.S. Government-sponsored Debt Securities and U.S. Treasury Securities The amortized cost, unrealized gains and losses and fair value of debt securities were as follows: December 31, 2023 Amortized Cost Gross Unrealized Fair Value Gains Losses (in millions) U.S. government-sponsored debt securities $ 1,607 $ 2 $ ( 1 ) $ 1,608 U.S. Treasury securities 5,956 19 ( 43 ) 5,932 Total $ 7,563 $ 21 $ ( 44 ) $ 7,540 13 Table of Contents VISA INC.

The stated maturities of debt securities were as follows: December 31, 2023 (in millions) Due within one year $ 4,731 Due after one year through five years 2,809 Total $ 7,540 Equity Securities The Company’s non-marketable equity securities include investments in privately held companies without readily determinable fair values. These investments are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis and are classified as Level 3 due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and the fact that significant inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require management’s judgment. 14 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) The following table summarizes the total carrying value of the Company’s non-marketable equity securities that were accounted for using the fair value measurement alternative and held as of December 31, 2023, including the cumulative unrealized gains and losses: December 31, 2023 (in millions) Initial cost basis $ 710 Adjustments: Upward adjustments 909 Downward adjustments (including impairment) ( 430 ) Carrying amount $ 1,189 Unrealized gains and losses included in the carrying value of the Company’s non-marketable equity securities accounted for using the fair value measurement alternative and still held as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, were as follows: Three Months Ended December 31, 2023 2022 (in millions) Upward adjustments $ 9 $ 17 Downward adjustments (including impairment) $ — $ — For the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized net unrealized gains of $ 36 million and net unrealized losses of $ 102 million, respectively, on marketable and non-marketable equity securities still held as of quarter end. Other Fair Value Disclosures Debt. Debt instruments are measured at amortized cost on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the debt instruments, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. As of December 31, 2023, the carrying value and estimated fair value of debt was $ 20.7 billion and $ 19.0 billion, respectively. As of September 30, 2023, the carrying value and estimated fair value of debt was $ 20.5 billion and $ 17.7 billion, respectively. Other financial instruments not measured at fair value. As of December 31, 2023, the carrying values of settlement receivable and payable and customer collateral are an approximate fair value due to their generally short maturities. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Non-financial assets. Certain non-financial assets such as goodwill, intangible assets and property, equipment and technology are subject to non-recurring fair value measurements if they are deemed to be impaired. The Company performed its annual impairment review of its indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill as of February 1, 2023, and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicated that impairment existed as of December 31, 2023 . 15 Table of Contents VISA INC.

Note 8—Settlement Guarantee Management The Company indemnifies its clients for settlement losses suffered due to failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa operating rules. This indemnification creates settlement risk for the Company due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. Historically, the Company has experienced minimal losses as a result of its settlement risk guarantee. However, the Company’s future obligations, which could be material under its guarantees, are not determinable as they are dependent upon future events. The Company’s settlement exposure is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time, which vary significantly day to day. During the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company’s maximum daily settlement exposure was $ 133.2 billion and the average daily settlement exposure was $ 83.0 billion. 16 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) The Company maintains and regularly reviews global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement exposure, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met.

These authorizations have no expiration date. As of December 31, 2023, the Company’s share repurchase programs had remaining authorized funds of $ 26.4 billion. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to October 2022 have been completed. Class B common stock. On January 23, 2024, Visa’s common stockholders approved amendments to the Company’s certificate of incorporation authorizing Visa to implement an exchange offer program that would have the effect of releasing transfer restrictions on portions of the Company’s class B common stock. The certificate of incorporation amendments automatically redenominate all shares of class B common stock as class B-1 common stock with no changes to the par value, conversion features, rights and privileges of the class B common stock. The amendments also authorized new classes of class B common stock that will only be issuable in connection with an exchange offer where a preceding class of B common stock was tendered in exchange and retired. The new authorization will have no impact to outstanding diluted earnings per class A common stock. Dividends. During the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company declared and paid dividends of $ 1.1 billion and $ 945 million, respectively. On January 23, 2024, the Company’s board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $ 0.52 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B-1 and C common stock and series A, B and C preferred stock on an as-converted basis), payable on March 1, 2024, to all holders of record as of February 9, 2024. 18 Table of Contents VISA INC.

Note 12—Income Taxes For the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, the effective income tax rates were 19 % and 16 %, respectively. The difference in the effective tax rates is primarily due to a $ 142 million tax benefit recognized during the three months ended December 31, 2022 due to the reassessment of an uncertain tax position as a result of new information obtained during an ongoing tax examination. During the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by $ 113 million. The Company’s net unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably impact the effective tax rate, increased by $ 29 million. The change in unrecognized tax benefits is related to various tax positions across several jurisdictions. In January 2024, a resolution was reached regarding India tax assessments for years falling within the period from 2010 to 2019. As a result, the Company filed to withdraw appeals to the appellate authorities for these years. Effective through September 30, 2028, the Company’s operating hub in the Asia Pacific region is subject to a tax incentive in Singapore which is conditional upon meeting certain requirements. The Company’s tax filings are subject to examination by U.S. federal, state and foreign taxing authorities. The timing and outcome of the final resolutions of the various ongoing income tax examinations and refund claims are uncertain. However, it is reasonably possible that the Company’s net unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by approximately $ 400 million in the next 12 months. Note 13—Legal Matters The Company is party to various legal and regulatory proceedings. Some of these proceedings involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. For those proceedings where a loss is determined to be only reasonably possible or probable but not estimable, the Company has disclosed the nature of the claim. Additionally, unless otherwise disclosed below with respect to these proceedings, the Company cannot provide an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss. Although the Company believes that it has strong defenses for the litigation and regulatory proceedings described below, it could, in the future, incur judgments or fines or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. From time to time, the Company may engage in settlement discussions or mediations with respect to one or more of its outstanding litigation matters, either on its own behalf or collectively with other parties. The litigation accrual is an estimate and is based on management’s understanding of its litigation profile, the specifics of each case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management’s best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date. The following table summarizes the activity related to accrued litigation: Three Months Ended December 31, 2023 2022 (in millions) Balance as of beginning of period $ 1,751 $ 1,456 Provision for uncovered legal matters 10 — Provision for covered legal matters 22 347 Payments for legal matters ( 312 ) ( 101 ) Balance as of end of period $ 1,471 $ 1,702 Accrual Summary—U.S. Covered Litigation Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A. and Visa International are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the 20 Table of Contents VISA INC.

Unlike the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Europe retrospective responsibility plan does not have an escrow account that is used to fund settlements or judgments. The Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through periodic adjustments to the conversion rates applicable to the series B and C preferred stock. An accrual for the VE territory covered losses and a reduction to stockholders’ equity will be recorded when the loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. See further discussion below under VE Territory Covered Litigation and Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans .

VE Territory Covered Litigation Europe Merchant Litigation Since July 2013, proceedings have been commenced by more than 1,150 Merchants (the capitalized term “Merchant” when used in this section, means a Merchant together with subsidiary/affiliate companies that are party to the same claim) against Visa Europe, Visa Inc. and other Visa subsidiaries in the UK and other countries primarily relating to interchange rates in Europe and in some cases relating to fees charged by Visa and certain Visa rules. As of the filing date, Visa has settled the claims asserted by over 475 Merchants, and there are approximately 600 Merchants with outstanding claims. In addition, over 30 additional Merchants have threatened to commence similar proceedings. Standstill agreements have been entered into with respect to some of those threatened Merchant claims, several of which have been settled. Other Litigation MiCamp Solutions On December 8, 2023, a complaint was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California by MiCamp Solutions, LLC against Visa on behalf of a purported class of Independent Sales Organizations (ISOs) and their merchant customers and a purported subclass of ISOs. The complaint alleges violations of federal and state antitrust laws, state data privacy laws, and the constitution, based on, among other things, Visa’s interchange fees and its assessment of fees for non-compliance with its surcharge rules. The complaint seeks to recover damages and to enjoin the enforcement of Visa’s default interchange and surcharge rules, among other things. Mirage Wine + Spirit’s Inc. On December 14, 2023, a putative class action was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Illinois by Mirage Wine + Spirit’s Inc. against Apple Inc., Visa Inc. and Mastercard Incorporated on behalf of certain merchants in the United States that accepted Apple Pay as a method of payment at the physical point-of-sale from December 14, 2019. Plaintiff alleges a conspiracy under which Apple agreed not to enter a purported market for point-of-sale payment card networks services and seeks damages, injunctive relief and attorneys’ fees based on alleged violations of section 1 of the Sherman Act. On January 5, 2024, Visa requested transfer of the action to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York for coordinated or consolidated pretrial proceedings with the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation. 22 Table of Contents ITEM 2.

All statements other than statements of historical fact could be forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made, are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. We describe risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, any of these forward-looking statements in our SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the year ended September 30, 2023, and any subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. Except as required by law, we do not intend to update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 23 Table of Contents Overview Visa is a global payments technology company that facilitates global commerce and money movement across more than 200 countries and territories among a global set of consumers, merchants, financial institutions and government entities through innovative technologies.

A summary of our as-reported U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP operating results is as follows: Three Months Ended December 31, 2023 2022 % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages and per share data) Net revenues $ 8,634 $ 7,936 9 % Operating expenses $ 2,680 $ 2,846 (6 %) Net income $ 4,890 $ 4,179 17 % Diluted earnings per share $ 2.39 $ 1.99 20 % Non-GAAP operating expenses (2) $ 2,619 $ 2,439 7 % Non-GAAP net income (2) $ 4,938 $ 4,581 8 % Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (2) $ 2.41 $ 2.18 11 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. (2) For a full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results, see tables in Non-GAAP financial results below. Highlights for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. For the three months ended December 31, 2023, net revenues increased 9% over the prior-year comparable period, primarily due to the growth in nominal cross-border volume, processed transactions and nominal payments volume, partially offset by higher client incentives. During the three months ended December 31, 2023, exchange rate movements did not have a material impact on net revenues growth. See Results of Operations—Net Revenues below for further discussion. For the three months ended December 31, 2023, GAAP operating expenses decreased 6% over the prior-year comparable period, primarily driven by lower litigation provision, partially offset by higher personnel expenses. See Results of Operations—Operating Expenses below for further discussion. During the three months ended December 31, 2023, exchange rate movements positively impacted our operating expenses by approximately one percentage point. For the three months ended December 31, 2023, non-GAAP operating expenses increased 7% over the prior-year comparable period, primarily driven by higher personnel expenses. Acquisition. On January 16, 2024, we acquired Pismo Holdings (Pismo), a global cloud-native issuer processing and core banking platform, for $1.0 billion in cash. Common stock repurchases. During the three months ended December 31, 2023, we repurchased 15 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market for $3.6 billion. As of December 31, 2023, our share repurchase programs had remaining authorized funds of $26.4 billion. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Non-GAAP financial results. We use non-GAAP financial measures of our performance which exclude certain items which we believe are not representative of our continuing operations, as they may be non-recurring or have no cash impact, and may distort our longer-term operating trends. We consider non-GAAP measures useful to investors because they provide greater transparency into management’s view and assessment of our ongoing operating performance. • Gains and losses on equity investments. Gains and losses on equity investments include periodic non-cash fair value adjustments and gains and losses upon sale of an investment. These long-term investments are strategic in nature and are primarily private company investments. Gains and losses associated with these 24 Table of Contents investments are tied to the performance of the companies that we invest in and therefore do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business. • Amortization of acquired intangible assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, customer relationships and brands acquired in connection with business combinations executed beginning in fiscal 2019. Amortization charges for our acquired intangible assets are non-cash and are significantly affected by the timing, frequency and size of our acquisitions, rather than our core operations. As such, we have excluded this amount to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance. • Acquisition-related costs. Acquisition-related costs consist primarily of one-time transaction and integration costs associated with our business combinations. These costs include professional fees, technology integration fees, restructuring activities and other direct costs related to the purchase and integration of acquired entities. These costs also include retention equity and deferred equity compensation when they are agreed upon as part of the purchase price of the transaction but are required to be recognized as expense post-combination. We have excluded these amounts as the expenses are recognized for a limited duration and do not reflect the underlying performance of our business. • Litigation provision. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we recorded additional accruals to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. Under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, we recover the monetary liabilities related to the U.S. covered litigation through a downward adjustment to the rate at which shares of our class B common stock ultimately convert into shares of class A common stock. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, basic and diluted earnings per class A common stock were unchanged, as a result of the downward adjustments of the class B common stock conversion rate during the period. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 13—Legal Matters to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Non-GAAP operating expenses, non-operating income (expense), income tax provision, effective income tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share should not be relied upon as substitutes for, or considered in isolation from, measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following tables reconcile our as-reported financial measures, calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to our respective non-GAAP financial measures: Three Months Ended December 31, 2023 Operating Expenses Non-operating Income (Expense) Income Tax Provision (1) Effective Income Tax Rate (2) Net Income Diluted Earnings Per Share (2) (in millions, except percentages and per share data) As reported $ 2,680 $ 88 $ 1,152 19.1 % $ 4,890 $ 2.39 (Gains) losses on equity investments, net — (4) (1) (3) — Amortization of acquired intangible assets (40) — 9 31 0.01 Acquisition-related costs (21) — 1 20 0.01 Non-GAAP $ 2,619 $ 84 $ 1,161 19.0 % $ 4,938 $ 2.41 25 Table of Contents Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 Operating Expenses Non-operating Income (Expense) Income Tax Provision (1) Effective Income Tax Rate (2) Net Income Diluted Earnings Per Share (2) (in millions, except percentages and per share data) As reported $ 2,846 $ (113) $ 798 16.0 % $ 4,179 $ 1.99 (Gains) losses on equity investments, net — 106 24 82 0.04 Amortization of acquired intangible assets (43) — 9 34 0.02 Acquisition-related costs (23) — 2 21 0.01 Litigation provision (341) — 76 265 0.13 Non-GAAP $ 2,439 $ (7) $ 909 16.5 % $ 4,581 $ 2.18 (1) Determined by applying applicable tax rates. (2) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Effective income tax rate, diluted earnings per share and their respective totals are calculated based on unrounded numbers. Payments volume and processed transactions. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues. Payments volume represents the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, V PAY and Interlink brands and excludes Europe co-badged volume. Nominal payments volume is denominated in U.S. dollars and is calculated each quarter by applying an established U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rate for each local currency in which our volumes are reported. Processed transactions represent transactions using cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, V PAY, Interlink and PLUS brands processed on Visa’s networks. The following table presents nominal payments and cash volume: U.S. International Visa Inc. Three Months Ended September 30, (1) Three Months Ended September 30, (1) Three Months Ended September 30, (1) 2023 2022 % Change (2) 2023 2022 % Change (2) 2023 2022 % Change (2) (in billions, except percentages) Nominal payments volume Consumer credit $ 580 $ 551 5 % $ 735 $ 684 7 % $ 1,315 $ 1,236 6 % Consumer debit (3) 730 683 7 % 744 638 17 % 1,474 1,320 12 % Commercial (4) 259 246 6 % 150 130 15 % 409 376 9 % Total nominal payments volume (2) $ 1,569 $ 1,479 6 % $ 1,629 $ 1,452 12 % $ 3,198 $ 2,932 9 % Cash volume (5) 155 155 (1 %) 474 451 5 % 629 607 4 % Total nominal volume (2),(6) $ 1,724 $ 1,635 5 % $ 2,103 $ 1,904 11 % $ 3,827 $ 3,538 8 % 26 Table of Contents The following table presents the change in nominal and constant payments and cash volume: International Visa Inc.

Therefore, service revenues reported for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, were based on nominal payments volume reported by our financial institution clients for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. On occasion, previously presented volume information may be updated. Prior period updates are not material. (2) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes and totals are calculated based on unrounded numbers. (3) Includes consumer prepaid volume and Interlink volume. (4) Includes large, medium and small business credit and debit, as well as commercial prepaid volume. (5) Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. (6) Total nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution clients, subject to review by Visa. (7) Growth on a constant-dollar basis excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar. The following table presents the number of processed transactions: Three Months Ended December 31, 2023 2022 % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Visa processed transactions 57,472 52,512 9 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

Results of Operations Net Revenues The following table presents our net revenues earned in the U.S. and internationally: Three Months Ended December 31, 2023 2022 % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) U.S. $ 3,645 $ 3,567 2 % International 4,989 4,369 14 % Net revenues $ 8,634 $ 7,936 9 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. Net revenues increased over the three-month prior-year comparable period primarily due to the growth in nominal cross-border volume, processed transactions and nominal payments volume, partially offset by higher client incentives. 27 Table of Contents Our net revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. During the three months ended December 31, 2023, exchange rate movements did not have a material impact on net revenues growth. The following table presents the components of our net revenues: Three Months Ended December 31, 2023 2022 % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Service revenues $ 3,915 $ 3,511 11 % Data processing revenues 4,356 3,827 14 % International transaction revenues 3,019 2,797 8 % Other revenues 692 587 18 % Client incentives (3,348) (2,786) 20 % Net revenues $ 8,634 $ 7,936 9 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. • Service revenues increased primarily due to 9% growth in nominal payments volume and select pricing modifications. • Data processing revenues increased primarily due to 9% growth in processed transactions, select pricing modifications and business mix. • International transaction revenues increased primarily due to growth in nominal cross-border volumes of 18%, excluding transactions within Europe, partially offset by lower volatility of a broad range of currencies. • Other revenues increased primarily due to select pricing modifications and growth in consulting services. • Client incentives increased primarily due to growth in payments volume. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. Operating Expenses The following table presents the components of our total operating expenses: Three Months Ended December 31, 2023 2022 % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Personnel $ 1,479 $ 1,337 11 % Marketing 293 332 (12 %) Network and processing 181 178 1 % Professional fees 131 109 21 % Depreciation and amortization 247 227 9 % General and administrative 340 322 5 % Litigation provision 9 341 (97 %) Total operating expenses $ 2,680 $ 2,846 (6 %) (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. • Personnel expenses increased during the three months ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to a higher number of employees and compensation, reflecting our strategy to invest in future growth. 28 Table of Contents • Marketing expenses decreased during the three months ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to spend related to the FIFA World Cup 2022 TM in the prior year and absent in the current year. • Professional fees increased during the three months ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to higher legal and consulting fees. • General and administrative expenses increased during the three months ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to higher usage of travel related card benefits and indirect taxes, partially offset by favorable foreign currency fluctuations. • Litigation provision decreased during the three months ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to the accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation in the prior year and absent in the current year. See Note 13—Legal Matters to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Non-operating Income (Expense) The following table presents the components of our non-operating income (expense): Three Months Ended December 31, 2023 2022 % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Interest expense $ (187) $ (137) 36 % Investment income (expense) and other 275 24 NM Total non-operating income (expense) $ 88 $ (113) (178 %) NM - Not meaningful (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. • Interest expense increased during the three months ended December 31, 2023 primarily due to losses from derivative instruments and the discrete tax benefit recognized during the prior year, partially offset by lower interest expense related to lower outstanding debt. • Investment income (expense) and other increased during the three months ended December 31, 2023, primarily due to higher interest income on our cash and investments and gains on our investments. Effective Income Tax Rate The following table presents our effective income tax rates: Three Months Ended December 31, 2023 2022 Effective income tax rate 19 % 16 % The difference in the effective tax rates is primarily due to a $142 million tax benefit recognized during the three months ended December 31, 2022 due to the reassessment of an uncertain tax position as a result of new information obtained during an ongoing tax examination. 29 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Data The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the periods presented: Three Months Ended December 31, 2023 2022 (in millions) Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 3,614 $ 4,171 Investing activities $ (1,889) $ (510) Financing activities $ (4,379) $ (6,347) Operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was lower than the prior-year comparable period primarily due to higher incentive payments and higher litigation payments, partially offset by continued growth in our underlying business. Investing activities. Cash used in investing activities for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was higher than the prior-year comparable period primarily due to higher purchases of investment securities and cash received from the settlement of net investment hedge derivative instruments in the prior year. Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities for the three months ended December 31, 2023 was lower than the prior-year comparable period primarily due to the principal debt payment upon maturity of our December 2022 senior notes in the prior year, partially offset by higher share repurchases and higher dividends paid. See Note 7—Debt and Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements . Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings and the returns that these holdings provide. Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our current and projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances. Uses of Liquidity There has been no significant change to our primary uses of liquidity since September 30, 2023, except as discussed below. Common stock repurchases. During the three months ended December 31, 2023, we repurchased shares of our class A common stock in the open market for $3.6 billion. As of December 31, 2023, our share repurchase programs had remaining authorized funds of $26.4 billion. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Dividends . During the three months ended December 31, 2023, we declared and paid $1.1 billion in dividends to holders of our common and preferred stock. On January 23, 2024, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.52 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B-1 and C common stock and series A, B and C convertible participating preferred stock on an as-converted basis). See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board. All preferred and class B-1 and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends. Acquisition . On January 16 2024, we acquired Pismo for $1.0 billion in cash. See Note 2—Acquisitions to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. 30 Table of Contents Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2023-07, which is intended to improve reportable segment disclosure requirements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about significant segment expense s. This standard also enhances interim disclosure requirements and provides new segment disclosure requirements for entities with a single reportable segment. This ASU is effective for our annual periods beginning October 1, 2024, and interim periods beginning October 1, 2025, and requires retrospective application to all prior periods presented. We are currently evaluating the impact of the ASU on our disclosures. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU 2023-09, which provides improvements to income tax disclosures. This standard requires disaggregated information related to effective tax rate reconciliation as well as information on income taxes paid. This ASU is effective for our annual periods beginning October 1, 2025, and requires prospective application with the option to apply the standard retrospectively. We are currently evaluating the impact of the ASU on our disclosures. ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk There have been no significant changes to our market risks since September 30, 2023. ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) of Visa Inc. at the end of the period covered by this report and, based on such evaluation, have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures of Visa Inc. were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of such date. Changes in internal control over financial reporting. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our first quarter of fiscal 2024 that have materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 31 Table of Contents PART II.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Organization. Visa Inc., together with its subsidiaries (Visa or the Company), is a global payments technology company that facilitates global commerce and money movement across more than 200 countries and territories. Visa operates one of the world’s largest electronic payments networks — VisaNet — which provides transaction processing services (primarily authorization, clearing and settlement). The Company offers products, solutions and services that facilitate secure, reliable and efficient money movement for participants in the ecosystem. Visa is not a financial institution and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders of Visa products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, Visa’s financial institution clients. Consolidation and basis of presentation. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The Company consolidates its majority-owned and controlled entities, including variable interest entities (VIEs) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company’s investments in VIEs have not been material to its unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirements for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and, consequently, do not include all of the annual disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. Reference should be made to Visa’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022 for additional disclosures, including a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. Use of estimates. The preparation of the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained, and will be recognized in the period in which such changes occur. Future actual results could differ materially from these estimates. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement. In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2020-04, which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. Subsequently, the FASB also issued amendments to this standard. The amendments in the ASU are effective upon issuance through December 31, 2024. During the prior quarter, the Company adopted certain optional expedients provided in this ASU in relation to contract modifications and hedge accounting. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 11 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) Note 2—Acquisitions Pending Acquisition In June 2023, Visa entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Pismo Holdings, a cloud-native issuer processing and core banking platform with operations in Latin America, Asia Pacific and Europe, for $ 1.0 billion in cash. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including applicable regulatory reviews and approvals. Note 3—Revenues The nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of the Company’s revenues and cash flows and how they are affected by economic factors are most appropriately depicted through the Company’s revenue categories and geographical markets.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan Under the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Company maintains an escrow account from which settlements of, or judgments in, certain litigation referred to as the “U.S. covered litigation” are paid. The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the U.S. litigation escrow account balance. See Note 13—Legal Matters . The following table presents the changes in the restricted cash equivalents—U.S. litigation escrow account: Nine Months Ended June 30, 2023 2022 (in millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 1,449 $ 894 Deposits into the U.S. litigation escrow account 850 850 Payments to opt-out merchants (1) , net of interest earned on escrow funds ( 672 ) ( 261 ) Balance at end of period $ 1,627 $ 1,483 (1) These payments are associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. See Note 13—Legal Matters . Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plan Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rates in the Visa Europe territory (VE territory covered litigation). Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover certain losses resulting from VE territory covered litigation (VE territory covered losses) through a periodic adjustment to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the series B and C preferred stock. VE territory covered losses are recorded in a contra-equity account referred to as “right to recover for covered losses” within stockholders’ equity before the corresponding adjustment to the applicable conversion rate is effected. Adjustments to the conversion rate may be executed once in any six-month period unless a single, individual loss greater than € 20 million is incurred, in which case, the six-month limitation does not apply. When the adjustment to the conversion rate is made, the amount previously recorded in “right to recover for covered losses” as contra-equity is then recorded against the book value of the preferred stock within stockholders’ equity. 13 Table of Contents VISA INC.

See Note 13—Legal Matters . (2) Adjustment to right to recover for covered losses for the conversion rate adjustment differs from the actual recovered amount due to differences in foreign exchange rates between the time the losses were incurred and the subsequent recovery through the conversion rate adjustment. The following table presents the as-converted value of the preferred stock available to recover VE territory covered losses compared to the book value of preferred stock recorded in stockholders’ equity within the Company’s consolidated balance sheets: June 30, 2023 September 30, 2022 As-converted Value of Preferred Stock (1),(2) Book Value of Preferred Stock (1) As-converted Value of Preferred Stock (1),(3) Book Value of Preferred Stock (1) (in millions) Series B preferred stock $ 1,730 $ 441 $ 1,309 $ 460 Series C preferred stock 2,721 801 2,044 812 Total 4,451 1,242 3,353 1,272 Less: right to recover for covered losses ( 25 ) ( 25 ) ( 35 ) ( 35 ) Total recovery for covered losses available $ 4,426 $ 1,217 $ 3,318 $ 1,237 (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

Money market funds, U.S. Treasury securities and marketable equity securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The Company’s deferred compensation liability is measured at fair value based on marketable equity securities held under the deferred compensation plan. Level 2 assets and liabilities. The fair value of U.S. government-sponsored debt securities, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. Derivative instruments are valued using inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. U.S. Government-sponsored Debt Securities and U.S. Treasury Securities The amortized cost, unrealized gains and losses and fair value of debt securities were as follows: June 30, 2023 Amortized Cost Gross Unrealized Fair Value Gains Losses (in millions) U.S. government-sponsored debt securities $ 1,155 $ — $ ( 2 ) $ 1,153 U.S. Treasury securities 4,062 — ( 99 ) 3,963 Total $ 5,217 $ — $ ( 101 ) $ 5,116 15 Table of Contents VISA INC.

The stated maturities of debt securities were as follows: June 30, 2023 (in millions) Due within one year $ 2,994 Due after 1 year through 5 years 2,122 Total $ 5,116 Equity Securities The Company’s non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. These investments are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis and are classified as Level 3 due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and the fact that significant inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require management’s judgment. 16 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) The following table summarizes the total carrying value of the Company’s non-marketable equity securities held as of June 30, 2023 including cumulative unrealized gains and losses: June 30, 2023 (in millions) Initial cost basis $ 764 Adjustments: Upward adjustments 899 Downward adjustments (including impairment) ( 431 ) Carrying amount, end of period $ 1,232 Unrealized gains and losses included in the carrying value of the Company’s non-marketable equity securities still held as of June 30, 2023 and 2022 were as follows: Three Months Ended June 30, Nine Months Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 (in millions) Upward adjustments $ 75 $ 5 $ 94 $ 231 Downward adjustments (including impairment) $ — $ ( 284 ) $ ( 86 ) $ ( 337 ) For the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized net unrealized gains of $ 96 million and net unrealized losses of $ 278 million, respectively, on marketable and non-marketable equity securities still held as of quarter end. For the nine months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized net unrealized losses of $ 85 million and $ 262 million, respectively, on marketable and non-marketable equity securities still held as of quarter end. Other Fair Value Disclosures Debt. Debt instruments are measured at amortized cost on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the debt instruments, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. As of June 30, 2023, the carrying value and estimated fair value of debt was $ 20.6 billion and $ 18.6 billion, respectively. As of September 30, 2022, the carrying value and estimated fair value of debt was $ 22.5 billion and $ 19.9 billion, respectively. Other financial instruments not measured at fair value. As of June 30, 2023, the carrying values of settlement receivable and payable and customer collateral are an approximate fair value due to their generally short maturities. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Non-financial assets. Certain non-financial assets such as goodwill, intangible assets and property, equipment and technology are subject to non-recurring fair value measurements if they are deemed to be impaired. The Company performed its annual impairment review of its indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill as of February 1, 2023, and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicated that impairment existed as of June 30, 2023 . 17 Table of Contents VISA INC.

Non-derivative Financial Instrument Designated as a Net Investment Hedge During the nine months ended June 30, 2023, the Company designated € 1.8 billion of the Euro-denominated fixed-rate senior notes (Euro Notes) issued in June 2022 as a hedge against a portion of the Company’s Euro-denominated net investment in Visa Europe. As of June 30, 2023, all of the € 3.0 billion Euro Notes were designated as a net investment hedge. Credit Facility In May 2023, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement for a 5 year, unsecured $ 7.0 billion revolving credit facility, which will expire in May 2028. Interest on borrowings will be charged at the applicable reference rate or an alternative base rate as defined in the credit agreement based on the currency and 18 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) type of the borrowing, plus an applicable margin based on the applicable credit rating of the Company’s senior unsecured long-term debt. The Company has agreed to pay a commitment fee which will fluctuate based on such applicable rating of the Company. As of June 30, 2023, the Company was in compliance with all related covenants. This credit facility is maintained to ensure the integrity of the payment card settlement process and for general corporate purposes. As of June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2022, the Company had no amounts outstanding under the credit facility. Note 8—Settlement Guarantee Management The Company indemnifies its clients for settlement losses suffered due to failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa operating rules. This indemnification creates settlement risk for the Company due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. Historically, the Company has experienced minimal losses as a result of its settlement risk guarantee. However, the Company’s future obligations, which could be material under its guarantees, are not determinable as they are dependent upon future events. The Company’s settlement exposure is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time, which vary significantly day to day. During the nine months ended June 30, 2023, the Company’s maximum daily settlement exposure was $ 125.6 billion and the average daily settlement exposure was $ 76.3 billion. The Company maintains and regularly reviews global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement exposure, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. The Company held the following collateral to manage settlement exposure: June 30, 2023 September 30, 2022 (in millions) Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents $ 2,907 $ 2,342 Pledged securities at market value 408 213 Letters of credit 1,717 1,582 Guarantees 1,094 950 Total $ 6,126 $ 5,087 19 Table of Contents VISA INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) Note 12—Income Taxes For the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023, the effective income tax rates were 19 % and 18 %, respectively, and for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2022, the effective income tax rates were 11 % and 17 %, respectively. The difference in the effective tax rates is primarily due to the following: • During the nine months ended June 30, 2023, a $ 142 million tax benefit related to prior years due to the reassessment of an uncertain tax position as a result of new information obtained during an ongoing tax examination; and • During the three months ended June 30, 2022, a $ 176 million tax benefit related to prior years due to a decrease in the state apportionment ratio as a result of a tax position taken related to a ruling. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023, the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by $ 615 million and $ 593 million, respectively. The Company’s net unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably impact the effective tax rate, increased by $ 315 million and $ 192 million, respectively. The change in unrecognized tax benefits is related to various tax positions across several jurisdictions, including refund claims filed during the quarter. Additionally, the nine month period reflects the change in unrecognized tax benefits related to the reassessment mentioned above. The Company’s tax filings are subject to examination by U.S. federal, state and foreign taxing authorities. The timing and outcome of the final resolutions of the various ongoing income tax examinations are highly uncertain. It is not reasonably possible to estimate the increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. Note 13—Legal Matters The Company is party to various legal and regulatory proceedings. Some of these proceedings involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. For those proceedings where a loss is determined to be only reasonably possible or probable but not estimable, the Company has disclosed the nature of the claim. Additionally, unless otherwise disclosed below with respect to these proceedings, the Company cannot provide an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss. Although the Company believes that it has strong defenses for the litigation and regulatory proceedings described below, it could, in the future, incur judgments or fines or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. From time to time, the Company may engage in settlement discussions or mediations with respect to one or more of its outstanding litigation matters, either on its own behalf or collectively with other parties. The litigation accrual is an estimate and is based on management’s understanding of its litigation profile, the specifics of each case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management’s best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date. The following table summarizes the activity related to accrued litigation: Nine Months Ended June 30, 2023 2022 (in millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 1,456 $ 983 Provision for uncovered legal matters 1 2 Provision for covered legal matters 808 878 Payments for legal matters ( 720 ) ( 377 ) Balance at end of period $ 1,545 $ 1,486 Accrual Summary—U.S. Covered Litigation Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A. and Visa International are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, which the Company refers to as the U.S. covered litigation. An accrual for the 24 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) U.S. covered litigation and a charge to the litigation provision are recorded when a loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. In making this determination, the Company evaluates available information, including but not limited to actions taken by the Company’s litigation committee. The total accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the escrow account balance. See further discussion below under U.S. Covered Litigation and Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans. The following table summarizes the accrual activity related to U.S. covered litigation: Nine Months Ended June 30, 2023 2022 (in millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 1,441 $ 881 Provision for interchange multidistrict litigation 797 861 Payments for U.S. covered litigation ( 699 ) ( 262 ) Balance at end of period $ 1,539 $ 1,480 During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023, the Company recorded additional accruals of $ 456 million and $ 797 million, respectively, and deposited $ 500 million and $ 850 million, respectively, into the U.S. litigation escrow account to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. The U.S. covered litigation accrual balance is consistent with the Company’s best estimate of its share of a probable and reasonably estimable loss with respect to the U.S. covered litigation. While this estimate is consistent with the Company’s view of the current status of the litigation, the probable and reasonably estimable loss or range of such loss could materially vary based on developments in the litigation. The Company will continue to consider and reevaluate this estimate in light of the substantial uncertainties with respect to the litigation. The Company is unable to estimate a potential loss or range of loss, if any, at trial if negotiated resolutions cannot be reached. Accrual Summary—VE Territory Covered Litigation Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the Europe retrospective responsibility plan. Unlike the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Europe retrospective responsibility plan does not have an escrow account that is used to fund settlements or judgments. The Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through periodic adjustments to the conversion rates applicable to the series B and C preferred stock. An accrual for the VE territory covered losses and a reduction to stockholders’ equity will be recorded when the loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. See further discussion below under VE Territory Covered Litigation and Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans .

The parties have requested reassignment of the case to the judge presiding over MDL 1720 for inclusion in MDL 1720. Consumer Interchange Litigation On December 30, 2022, a putative class action was filed in California state court against Visa, Mastercard, and certain financial institutions on behalf of all Visa and Mastercard cardholders in California who made a purchase using a Visa-branded or Mastercard-branded payment card in California from January 1, 2004. Plaintiffs primarily allege a conspiracy to fix interchange fees and seek injunctive relief, attorneys’ fees and damages as direct and indirect purchasers based on alleged violations of California law. On January 11, 2023, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint asserting the same claims as asserted in the prior complaint. On January 30, 2023, Visa removed the action to federal court. On February 10, 2023, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation issued an order transferring the case to MDL 1720. On June 15, 2023, plaintiffs’ motion to remand the case to California state court was denied, and plaintiffs have appealed. VE Territory Covered Litigation Europe Merchant Litigation Since July 2013, proceedings have been commenced by more than 1,100 Merchants (the capitalized term “Merchant” when used in this section, means a Merchant together with subsidiary/affiliate companies that are party to the same claim) against Visa Europe, Visa Inc. and other Visa subsidiaries in the UK and other countries primarily relating to interchange rates in Europe and in some cases relating to fees charged by Visa and certain Visa rules. As of the filing date, Visa has settled the claims asserted by over 175 Merchants, and there are approximately 900 Merchants with outstanding claims. In addition, over 30 additional Merchants have threatened to commence similar proceedings. Standstill agreements have been entered into with respect to some of those threatened Merchant claims, several of which have been settled. On June 8, 2023, the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal denied class certification in the two class action claims.

The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 1—Financial Statements of this report. Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that relate to, among other things, the impact on our future financial position, results of operations and cash flows as a result of the war in Ukraine; the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the resumption of international travel; prospects, developments, strategies and growth of our business; anticipated expansion of our products in certain countries; industry developments; anticipated timing and benefits of our acquisitions; expectations regarding litigation matters, investigations and proceedings; timing and amount of stock repurchases; sufficiency of sources of liquidity and funding; effectiveness of our risk management programs; and expectations regarding the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements. Forward-looking statements generally are identified by words such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,” “projects,” “could,” “should,” “will,” “continue” and other similar expressions. All statements other than statements of historical fact could be forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made, are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. We describe risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, any of these forward-looking statements in our SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the year ended September 30, 2022, and any subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. Except as required by law, we do not intend to update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 28 Table of Contents Overview Visa is a global payments technology company that facilitates global commerce and money movement across more than 200 countries and territories among a global set of consumers, merchants, financial institutions and government entities through innovative technologies.

A summary of our as-reported U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP operating results is as follows: Three Months Ended June 30, Nine Months Ended June 30, 2023 2022 % Change (1) 2023 2022 % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages and per share data) Net revenues $ 8,123 $ 7,275 12 % $ 24,044 $ 21,523 12 % Operating expenses $ 3,099 $ 3,127 (1 %) $ 8,594 $ 7,797 10 % Net income $ 4,156 $ 3,411 22 % $ 12,592 $ 11,017 14 % Diluted earnings per share $ 2.00 $ 1.60 25 % $ 6.02 $ 5.14 17 % Non-GAAP operating expenses (2) $ 2,578 $ 2,353 10 % $ 7,598 $ 6,755 12 % Non-GAAP net income (2) $ 4,499 $ 4,206 7 % $ 13,464 $ 11,943 13 % Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (2) $ 2.16 $ 1.98 9 % $ 6.44 $ 5.57 16 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. (2) For a full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results, see tables in Non-GAAP financial results below. Disruption in the Banking Sector. During the nine months ended June 30, 2023, certain U.S. banks failed, which caused volatility in the global financial markets. These events did not have an impact on our operating results. We continuously monitor and manage balance sheet and operational risks from clients in our portfolio, including their settlement obligations. Russia & Ukraine. During the quarter ended March 31, 2022, economic sanctions were imposed on Russia by the U.S., European Union, United Kingdom and other jurisdictions and authorities, impacting Visa and its clients. In March 2022, we suspended our operations in Russia and as a result, are no longer generating revenue from domestic and cross-border activities related to Russia. For the nine months ended June 30, 2022, total net revenues from Russia, including revenues driven by domestic as well as cross-border activities, was approximately 3% of our consolidated net revenues. The continuing effects of the recent liquidity issues at certain financial institutions and the war in Ukraine are difficult to predict due to numerous uncertainties identified in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022 . We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business. Highlights for the first nine months of fiscal 2023. For the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023, net revenues increased 12% over each prior-year comparable period, primarily due to the growth in nominal cross-border volume, processed transactions and nominal payments volume, partially offset by higher client incentives. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023, exchange rate movements lowered our net revenues growth by approximately one percentage point and two percentage points, respectively. See Results of Operations—Net Revenues below for further discussion. For the three months ended June 30, 2023, GAAP operating expenses decreased 1% over the prior-year comparable period, primarily due to lower litigation provision, largely offset by higher expense related to personnel. For the nine months ended June 30, 2023, GAAP operating expenses increased 10% over the prior-year comparable period, primarily due to higher expense related to personnel. See Results of Operations—Operating Expenses below for further discussion. During the nine months ended June 30, 2023, exchange rate movements lowered our operating expense growth by approximately one percentage point. 29 Table of Contents For the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023, non-GAAP operating expenses increased 10% and 12% over the prior-year comparable periods, respectively, primarily due to higher expense related to personnel. For the nine months ended June 30, 2023, non-GAAP operating expenses also included higher general and administrative expense. Pending acquisition. In June 2023, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Pismo Holdings (Pismo), a cloud-native issuer processing and core banking platform with operations in Latin America, Asia Pacific and Europe, for $1.0 billion in cash. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including applicable regulatory reviews and approvals. Interchange multidistrict litigation. During the nine months ended June 30, 2023, we recorded additional accruals of $797 million to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. We also made deposits of $850 million into the U.S. litigation escrow account. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 13—Legal Matters to our unaudited consolidated financial statements . Common stock repurchases. In October 2022, our board of directors authorized a $12.0 billion share repurchase program . During the nine months ended June 30, 2023, we repurchased 39 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market for $8.4 billion. As of June 30, 2023, our repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $8.8 billion. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Non-GAAP financial results. We use non-GAAP financial measures of our performance which exclude certain items which we believe are not representative of our continuing operations, as they may be non-recurring or have no cash impact, and may distort our longer-term operating trends. We consider non-GAAP measures useful to investors because they provide greater transparency into management’s view and assessment of our ongoing operating performance. • Gains and losses on equity investments. Gains and losses on equity investments include periodic non-cash fair value adjustments and gains and losses upon sale of an investment. These long-term investments are strategic in nature and are primarily private company investments. Gains and losses and the related tax impacts associated with these investments are tied to the performance of the companies that we invest in and therefore do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business. • Amortization of acquired intangible assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, customer relationships and brands acquired in connection with business combinations executed beginning in fiscal 2019. Amortization charges for our acquired intangible assets are non-cash and are significantly affected by the timing, frequency and size of our acquisitions, rather than our core operations. As such, we have excluded this amount and the related tax impact to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance. • Acquisition-related costs. Acquisition-related costs consist primarily of one-time transaction and integration costs associated with our business combinations. These costs include professional fees, technology integration fees, restructuring activities and other direct costs related to the purchase and integration of acquired entities. These costs also include retention equity and deferred equity compensation when they are agreed upon as part of the purchase price of the transaction but are required to be recognized as expense post-combination. We have excluded these amounts and the related tax impacts as the expenses are recognized for a limited duration and do not reflect the underlying performance of our business. • Litigation provision. During the three months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, we recorded additional accruals to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation of $456 million and $716 million, respectively, and related tax benefit of $101 million and $159 million, respectively, determined by applying applicable tax rates. During the nine months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, we recorded additional accruals to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation of $797 million and $861 million, respectively, and related tax benefit of $177 million and $191 million, respectively, determined by applying applicable tax rates. Under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, we recover the monetary liabilities related to the U.S. covered litigation through a downward adjustment to the rate at which shares of our class B common stock convert into shares of class A common stock. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 13—Legal Matters to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. 30 Table of Contents • Russia-Ukraine charges . During the nine months ended June 30, 2022, we recorded a loss within general and administrative expense of $35 million from the deconsolidation of our Russian subsidiary. We also incurred charges of $25 million in personnel expense as a result of steps taken to support our employees in Russia and Ukraine. We have excluded these amounts and the related tax benefit of $4 million, determined by applying applicable tax rates, as they are one-time charges and do not reflect the underlying performance of our business. Non-GAAP operating expenses, non-operating income (expense), income tax provision, effective income tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share should not be relied upon as substitutes for, or considered in isolation from, measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Effective income tax rate, diluted earnings per share and their respective totals are calculated based on unrounded numbers. Payments volume and processed transactions. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues. Payments volume represents the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, V PAY and Interlink brands and excludes Europe co-badged volume. Nominal payments volume is denominated in U.S. dollars and is calculated each quarter by applying an established U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rate for each local currency in which our volumes are reported. Processed transactions represent transactions using cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, V PAY, Interlink and PLUS brands processed on Visa’s networks. 32 Table of Contents The following table presents nominal payments and cash volume: U.S. International Visa Inc.

Therefore, service revenues reported for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively, were based on nominal payments volume reported by our financial institution clients for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. On occasion, previously presented volume information may be updated. Prior period updates are not material. (2) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes and totals are calculated based on unrounded numbers. (3) Includes consumer prepaid volume and Interlink volume. (4) Includes large, medium and small business credit and debit, as well as commercial prepaid volume.

Results of Operations Net Revenues The following table presents our net revenues earned in the U.S. and internationally: Three Months Ended June 30, Nine Months Ended June 30, 2023 2022 % Change (1) 2023 2022 % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) U.S. $ 3,443 $ 3,170 9 % $ 10,550 $ 9,427 12 % International 4,680 4,105 14 % 13,494 12,096 12 % Net revenues $ 8,123 $ 7,275 12 % $ 24,044 $ 21,523 12 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. Net revenues increased over the three and nine-month prior-year comparable periods primarily due to the growth in nominal cross-border volume, processed transactions and nominal payments volume, partially offset by higher client incentives. Our net revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023, exchange rate movements lowered our net revenues growth by approximately one percentage point and two percentage points, respectively. The following table presents the components of our net revenues: Three Months Ended June 30, Nine Months Ended June 30, 2023 2022 % Change (1) 2023 2022 % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Service revenues $ 3,668 $ 3,189 15 % $ 10,950 $ 9,903 11 % Data processing revenues 4,105 3,579 15 % 11,751 10,673 10 % International transaction revenues 2,920 2,560 14 % 8,466 6,942 22 % Other revenues 597 517 15 % 1,735 1,440 20 % Client incentives (3,167) (2,570) 23 % (8,858) (7,435) 19 % Net revenues $ 8,123 $ 7,275 12 % $ 24,044 $ 21,523 12 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. • Service revenues increased primarily due to 6% and 4% growth in nominal payments volume over the three and nine-month prior-year comparable periods, respectively, and due to business mix. Service revenues increased over the nine month prior-year comparable period despite the impact of our suspension of operations in Russia. • Data processing revenues increased primarily due to overall growth in processed transactions of 10% and 11% over the three and nine-month prior-year comparable periods, respectively, growth in value added 34 Table of Contents services and select pricing modifications. Data processing revenues increased over the nine month prior-year comparable period despite the impact of our suspension of operations in Russia. • International transaction revenues increased over the three month prior-year comparable period primarily due to growth in nominal cross-border volumes of 22%, excluding transactions within Europe, and select pricing modifications, partially offset by business mix and lower volatility of a broad range of currencies. International transaction revenues increased over the nine month prior-year comparable period primarily due to growth in nominal cross-border volumes of 23%, excluding transactions within Europe, and select pricing modifications, partially offset by business mix. • Other revenues increased over the three month prior-year comparable period primarily due to select pricing modifications and growth in value added services revenues tied to consulting services. Other revenues increased over the nine month prior-year comparable period due to growth in value added services tied to marketing and consulting services, select pricing modifications and acquisition-related revenues. • Client incentives increased primarily due to growth in payments volume over the three and nine-month prior-year comparable periods. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. Operating Expenses The following table presents the components of our total operating expenses: Three Months Ended June 30, Nine Months Ended June 30, 2023 2022 % Change (1) 2023 2022 % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Personnel $ 1,481 $ 1,283 15 % $ 4,333 $ 3,634 19 % Marketing 297 313 (5 %) 938 907 3 % Network and processing 182 178 2 % 539 558 (3 %) Professional fees 133 117 13 % 372 342 9 % Depreciation and amortization 235 230 3 % 696 635 10 % General and administrative 314 289 9 % 918 856 7 % Litigation provision 457 717 (36 %) 798 865 (8 %) Total operating expenses $ 3,099 $ 3,127 (1 %) $ 8,594 $ 7,797 10 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. • Personnel expenses increased during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023 primarily due to higher number of employees and compensation, reflecting our strategy to invest in future growth, including acquisitions. • Marketing expenses increased during the nine months ended June 30, 2023 primarily due to increased spending in various campaigns, including the FIFA World Cup 2022 TM and client marketing. The increase was partially offset by the absence of spending for the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games Beijing 2022 in the current period. • Depreciation and amortization expenses increased during the nine months ended June 30, 2023 primarily due to additional depreciation and amortization from our on-going investments and acquisitions. • General and administrative expenses increased during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023 primarily due to higher usage of travel related card benefits, an increase in travel expenses and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations. The increase during the nine months ended June 30, 2023 was partially offset by the absence of expenses as a result of the suspension of our operations in Russia. • Litigation provision decreased during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2023 primarily due to lower accruals related to the U.S. covered litigation. See Note 13—Legal Matters to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. 35 Table of Contents Non-operating Income (Expense) The following table presents the components of our non-operating income (expense): Three Months Ended June 30, Nine Months Ended June 30, 2023 2022 % Change (1) 2023 2022 % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Interest expense $ (182) $ (111) 64 % $ (461) $ (379) 22 % Investment income (expense) and other 304 (208) (246 %) 412 (79) (625 %) Total non-operating income (expense) $ 122 $ (319) (138 %) $ (49) $ (458) (89 %) (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. • Interest expense increased during the three months ended June 30, 2023 primarily driven by losses from derivative instruments and higher interest related to income tax liabilities. Interest expense increased during the nine months ended June 30, 2023 primarily driven by losses from derivative instruments, partially offset by lower interest related to indirect taxes. • Investment income (expense) and other increased during the three months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to gains on our investments and higher interest income on our cash and investments. Investment income (expense) and other increased during the nine months ended June 30, 2023, primarily due to higher interest income on our cash and investments and lower losses on our investments. Effective Income Tax Rate The following table presents our effective income tax rates: Three Months Ended June 30, Nine Months Ended June 30, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Effective income tax rate 19 % 11 % 18 % 17 % The difference in the effective tax rates is primarily due to the following: • During the nine months ended June 30, 2023, a $142 million tax benefit related to prior years due to the reassessment of an uncertain tax position as a result of new information obtained during an ongoing tax examination; and • During the three months ended June 30, 2022, a $176 million tax benefit related to prior years due to a decrease in the state apportionment ratio as a result of a tax position taken related to a ruling. 36 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Data The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the periods presented: Nine Months Ended June 30, 2023 2022 (in millions) Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 13,828 $ 12,973 Investing activities (818) (4,395) Financing activities (13,192) (8,656) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents 844 (725) Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents $ 662 $ (803) Operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended June 30, 2023 was higher than the prior-year comparable period primarily due to growth in our underlying business, partially offset by higher incentive and litigation payments. Investing activities. Cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended June 30, 2023 was lower than the prior-year comparable period primarily due to the absence of cash paid for acquisitions, lower purchases of investment securities and cash received from the settlement of net investment hedge derivative instruments in the current year. Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended June 30, 2023 was higher than the prior-year comparable period primarily due to the absence of proceeds from the issuance of senior notes, the principal debt payment upon maturity of our December 2022 senior notes and higher dividends paid, partially offset by lower share repurchases. See Note 7—Debt and Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements . Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings and the returns that these holdings provide. Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our current and projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances. Credit facility extension. In May 2023, we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement for a 5 year, unsecured $7.0 billion revolving credit facility, which will expire in May 2028. See Note 7—Debt to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Uses of Liquidity There has been no significant change to our primary uses of liquidity since September 30, 2022, except as discussed below. Common stock repurchases.

See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. All preferred and class B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends. Senior notes .

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Organization. Visa Inc., together with its subsidiaries (Visa or the Company), is a global payments technology company that facilitates global commerce and money movement across more than 200 countries and territories. Visa operates one of the world’s largest electronic payments networks — VisaNet — which provides transaction processing services (primarily authorization, clearing and settlement). The Company offers products, solutions and services that facilitate secure, reliable and efficient money movement for participants in the ecosystem. Visa is not a financial institution and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders of Visa products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, Visa’s financial institution clients. Consolidation and basis of presentation. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The Company consolidates its majority-owned and controlled entities, including variable interest entities (VIEs) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company’s investments in VIEs have not been material to its unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirements for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and, consequently, do not include all of the annual disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. Reference should be made to the Visa Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022 for additional disclosures, including a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. Use of estimates. The preparation of the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained, and will be recognized in the period in which such changes occur. Future actual results could differ materially from these estimates. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncement. In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2020-04, which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. Subsequently, the FASB also issued amendments to this standard. The amendments in the ASU are effective upon issuance through December 31, 2024. During the quarter ended March 31, 2023 , the Company adopted certain optional expedients provided in this ASU in relation to contract modifications and hedge accounting. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 12 Table of Contents VISA INC.

The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the U.S. litigation escrow account balance. See Note 12—Legal Matters . 13 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) The following table presents the changes in the restricted cash equivalents—U.S. litigation escrow account: Six Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 (in millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 1,449 $ 894 Deposits into the litigation escrow account 350 250 Payments to opt-out merchants (1) , net of interest earned on escrow funds ( 183 ) ( 262 ) Balance at end of period $ 1,616 $ 882 (1) These payments are associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. See Note 12—Legal Matters . Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plan Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rates in the Visa Europe territory (VE territory covered litigation). Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover certain losses resulting from VE territory covered litigation (VE territory covered losses) through a periodic adjustment to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the series B and C preferred stock. VE territory covered losses are recorded in a contra-equity account referred to as “right to recover for covered losses” within stockholders’ equity before the corresponding adjustment to the applicable conversion rate is effected. Adjustments to the conversion rate may be executed once in any six-month period unless a single, individual loss greater than € 20 million is incurred, in which case, the six-month limitation does not apply. When the adjustment to the conversion rate is made, the amount previously recorded in “right to recover for covered losses” as contra-equity is then recorded against the book value of the preferred stock within stockholders’ equity. The following table presents the activities related to VE territory covered losses in preferred stock and “right to recover for covered losses” within stockholders’ equity: Preferred Stock Right to Recover for Covered Losses Series B Series C (in millions) Balance as of September 30, 2022 $ 460 $ 812 $ ( 35 ) VE territory covered losses incurred (1) — — ( 15 ) Recovery through conversion rate adjustment (2) ( 7 ) ( 7 ) 15 Balance as of March 31, 2023 $ 453 $ 805 $ ( 35 ) Preferred Stock Right to Recover for Covered Losses Series B Series C (in millions) Balance as of September 30, 2021 $ 1,071 $ 1,523 $ ( 133 ) VE territory covered losses incurred (1) — — ( 16 ) Recovery through conversion rate adjustment ( 26 ) ( 3 ) 29 Balance as of March 31, 2022 $ 1,045 $ 1,520 $ ( 120 ) (1) VE territory covered losses incurred reflect settlements with merchants and additional legal costs. See Note 12—Legal Matters . (2) Adjustment to right to recover for covered losses for the conversion rate adjustment differs from the actual recovered amount due to differences in foreign exchange rates between the time the losses were incurred and the subsequent recovery through the conversion rate adjustment. 14 Table of Contents VISA INC.

Money market funds, U.S. Treasury securities and marketable equity securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The Company’s deferred compensation liability is measured at fair value based on marketable equity securities held under the deferred compensation plan. Level 2 assets and liabilities. The fair value of U.S. government-sponsored debt securities, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. Derivative instruments are valued using inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. U.S. Government-sponsored Debt Securities and U.S. Treasury Securities The amortized cost, unrealized gains and losses and fair value of debt securities were as follows: March 31, 2023 Amortized Cost Gross Unrealized Fair Value Gains Losses (in millions) U.S. government-sponsored debt securities $ 1,016 $ 1 $ ( 1 ) $ 1,016 U.S. Treasury securities 4,332 6 ( 89 ) 4,249 Total $ 5,348 $ 7 $ ( 90 ) $ 5,265 16 Table of Contents VISA INC.

The stated maturities of debt securities were as follows: March 31, 2023 (in millions) Due within one year $ 2,425 Due after 1 year through 5 years 2,840 Total $ 5,265 Equity Securities The Company’s non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. These investments are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis and are classified as Level 3 due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and the fact that inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require management’s judgment. 17 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) The following table summarizes the total carrying value of the Company’s non-marketable equity securities held as of March 31, 2023 including cumulative unrealized gains and losses: March 31, 2023 (in millions) Initial cost basis $ 754 Adjustments: Upward adjustments 829 Downward adjustments (including impairment) ( 438 ) Carrying amount, end of period $ 1,145 Unrealized gains and losses included in the carrying value of the Company’s non-marketable equity securities still held as of March 31, 2023 and 2022 were as follows: Three Months Ended March 31, Six Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 (in millions) Upward adjustments $ 2 $ 2 $ 19 $ 226 Downward adjustments (including impairment) $ ( 89 ) $ ( 53 ) $ ( 89 ) $ ( 53 ) For the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized net unrealized losses of $ 82 million and $ 156 million, respectively, on marketable and non-marketable equity securities still held as of quarter end. For the six months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recognized net unrealized losses of $ 184 million and net unrealized gains of $ 16 million, respectively, on marketable and non-marketable equity securities still held as of quarter end. Other Fair Value Disclosures Debt. Debt instruments are measured at amortized cost on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the debt instruments, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. As of March 31, 2023, the carrying value and estimated fair value of debt was $ 20.6 billion and $ 18.9 billion, respectively. As of September 30, 2022, the carrying value and estimated fair value of debt was $ 22.5 billion and $ 19.9 billion, respectively. Other financial instruments not measured at fair value. As of March 31, 2023, the carrying values of settlement receivable and payable and customer collateral are an approximate fair value due to their generally short maturities. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Non-financial assets. Certain non-financial assets such as goodwill, intangible assets and property, equipment and technology are subject to non-recurring fair value measurements if they are deemed to be impaired. The Company performed its annual impairment review of its indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill as of February 1, 2023, and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicated that impairment existed as of March 31, 2023 . 18 Table of Contents VISA INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) Note 7—Settlement Guarantee Management The Company indemnifies its clients for settlement losses suffered due to failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa operating rules. This indemnification creates settlement risk for the Company due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. Historically, the Company has experienced minimal losses as a result of its settlement risk guarantee. However, the Company’s future obligations, which could be material under its guarantees, are not determinable as they are dependent upon future events. The Company’s settlement exposure is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time, which vary significantly day to day. During the six months ended March 31, 2023, the Company’s maximum daily settlement exposure was $ 123.5 billion and the average daily settlement exposure was $ 75.0 billion. The Company maintains and regularly reviews global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement exposure, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. The Company held the following collateral to manage settlement exposure: March 31, 2023 September 30, 2022 (in millions) Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents $ 2,739 $ 2,342 Pledged securities at market value 294 213 Letters of credit 1,638 1,582 Guarantees 1,068 950 Total $ 5,739 $ 5,087 20 Table of Contents VISA INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) For the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded share-based compensation cost related to the EIP of $ 214 million and $ 181 million, respectively, and for the six months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, the Company recorded share-based compensation cost related to the EIP of $ 384 million and $ 302 million, respectively. Note 11—Income Taxes For the three and six months ended March 31, 2023, the effective income tax rates were 19 % and 18 %, respectively, and for the three and six months ended March 31, 2022, the effective income tax rates were 20 % and 19 %, respectively. The difference in the effective tax rates is primarily due to a $ 142 million tax benefit related to prior years recognized during the six months ended March 31, 2023 due to the reassessment of an uncertain tax position as a result of new information obtained during an ongoing tax examination. During the three months ended March 31, 2023, the Company’s gross and net unrecognized tax benefits increased by $ 86 million and $ 26 million, respectively. During the six months ended March 31, 2023, the Company’s gross and net unrecognized tax benefits decreased by $ 22 million and $ 123 million, respectively. The change in unrecognized tax benefits is related to various tax positions across several jurisdictions. Additionally, for the six month period, the decrease in unrecognized tax benefits is primarily due to the reassessment mentioned above, partially offset by an increase in gross timing differences. The Company’s tax filings are subject to examination by U.S. federal, state and foreign taxing authorities. The timing and outcome of the final resolutions of the various ongoing income tax examinations are highly uncertain. It is not reasonably possible to estimate the increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. Note 12—Legal Matters The Company is party to various legal and regulatory proceedings. Some of these proceedings involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. For those proceedings where a loss is determined to be only reasonably possible or probable but not estimable, the Company has disclosed the nature of the claim. Additionally, unless otherwise disclosed below with respect to these proceedings, the Company cannot provide an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss. Although the Company believes that it has strong defenses for the litigation and regulatory proceedings described below, it could, in the future, incur judgments or fines or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. From time to time, the Company may engage in settlement discussions or mediations with respect to one or more of its outstanding litigation matters, either on its own behalf or collectively with other parties. The litigation accrual is an estimate and is based on management’s understanding of its litigation profile, the specifics of each case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management’s best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date. The following table summarizes the activity related to accrued litigation: Six Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 (in millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 1,456 $ 983 Provision for uncovered legal matters — 1 Provision for covered legal matters 352 150 Payments for legal matters ( 206 ) ( 365 ) Balance at end of period $ 1,602 $ 769 Accrual Summary—U.S. Covered Litigation Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A. and Visa International are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, which the Company refers to as the U.S. covered litigation. An accrual for the 24 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) U.S. covered litigation and a charge to the litigation provision are recorded when a loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. In making this determination, the Company evaluates available information, including but not limited to actions taken by the Company’s litigation committee. The total accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the escrow account balance. See further discussion below under U.S. Covered Litigation and Note 4—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans. The following table summarizes the accrual activity related to U.S. covered litigation: Six Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 (in millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 1,441 $ 881 Provision for interchange multidistrict litigation 341 145 Payments for U.S. covered litigation ( 201 ) ( 262 ) Balance at end of period $ 1,581 $ 764 During the six months ended March 31, 2023, the Company recorded an additional accrual of $ 341 million and deposited $ 350 million into the U.S. litigation escrow account to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. The U.S. covered litigation accrual balance is consistent with the Company’s best estimate of its share of a probable and reasonably estimable loss with respect to the U.S. covered litigation. While this estimate is consistent with the Company’s view of the current status of the litigation, the probable and reasonably estimable loss or range of such loss could materially vary based on developments in the litigation. The Company will continue to consider and reevaluate this estimate in light of the substantial uncertainties with respect to the litigation. The Company is unable to estimate a potential loss or range of loss, if any, at trial if negotiated resolutions cannot be reached. Accrual Summary—VE Territory Covered Litigation Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the Europe retrospective responsibility plan. Unlike the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Europe retrospective responsibility plan does not have an escrow account that is used to fund settlements or judgments. The Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through periodic adjustments to the conversion rates applicable to the series B and C preferred stock. An accrual for the VE territory covered losses and a reduction to stockholders’ equity will be recorded when the loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. See further discussion below under VE Territory Covered Litigation and Note 4—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans .

Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) - Individual Merchant Actions Visa has reached settlements with a number of merchants representing approximately 70 % of the Visa-branded payment card sales volume of merchants who opted out of the Amended Settlement Agreement with the Damages Class plaintiffs. Consumer Interchange Litigation On December 30, 2022, a putative class action was filed in California state court against Visa, Mastercard, and certain financial institutions on behalf of all Visa and Mastercard cardholders in California who made a purchase using a Visa-branded or Mastercard-branded payment card in California from January 1, 2004. Plaintiffs primarily allege a conspiracy to fix interchange fees and seek injunctive relief, attorneys’ fees and damages as direct and indirect purchasers based on alleged violations of California law. On January 11, 2023, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint asserting the same claims as asserted in the prior complaint. On January 30, 2023, Visa removed the action to federal court. On February 10, 2023, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation issued an order transferring the case to MDL 1720. On March 1, 2023, plaintiffs filed a motion to remand the case to California state court. VE Territory Covered Litigation Europe Merchant Litigation Since July 2013, proceedings have been commenced by more than 1,100 Merchants (the capitalized term “Merchant” when used in this section, means a Merchant together with subsidiary/affiliate companies that are party to the same claim) against Visa Europe, Visa Inc. and other Visa subsidiaries in the UK and other countries primarily relating to interchange rates in Europe and in some cases relating to fees charged by Visa and certain Visa rules. As of the filing date, Visa has settled the claims asserted by over 175 Merchants, and there are approximately 900 Merchants with outstanding claims. In addition, over 30 additional Merchants have threatened to commence similar proceedings. Standstill agreements have been entered into with respect to some of those threatened Merchant claims, several of which have been settled.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This management’s discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and capital resources of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries (Visa, we, us, our or the Company) on a historical basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings, as well as those factors that may affect future earnings. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 1—Financial Statements of this report. Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that relate to, among other things, the impact on our future financial position, results of operations and cash flows as a result of the war in Ukraine; the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the resumption of international travel; prospects, developments, strategies and growth of our business; anticipated expansion of our products in certain countries; industry developments; anticipated timing and benefits of our acquisitions; expectations regarding litigation matters, investigations and proceedings; timing and amount of stock repurchases; sufficiency of sources of liquidity and funding; effectiveness of our risk management programs; and expectations regarding the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements. Forward-looking statements generally are identified by words such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,” “projects,” “could,” “should,” “will,” “continue” and other similar expressions. All statements other than statements of historical fact could be forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made, are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. We describe risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, any of these forward-looking statements in our SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the year ended September 30, 2022, and any subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K.

A summary of our as-reported U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP operating results is as follows: Three Months Ended March 31, Six Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 % Change (1) 2023 2022 % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages and per share data) Net revenues $ 7,985 $ 7,189 11 % $ 15,921 $ 14,248 12 % Operating expenses $ 2,649 $ 2,387 11 % $ 5,495 $ 4,670 18 % Net income $ 4,257 $ 3,647 17 % $ 8,436 $ 7,606 11 % Diluted earnings per share $ 2.03 $ 1.70 20 % $ 4.02 $ 3.54 14 % Non-GAAP operating expenses (2) $ 2,581 $ 2,287 13 % $ 5,020 $ 4,402 14 % Non-GAAP net income (2) $ 4,384 $ 3,836 14 % $ 8,965 $ 7,737 16 % Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (2) $ 2.09 $ 1.79 17 % $ 4.27 $ 3.60 19 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. (2) For a full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results, see tables in Non-GAAP financial results below. Disruption in the Banking Sector. During the quarter ended March 31, 2023, certain financial institutions experienced liquidity issues, which resulted in the failure of two U.S. banks and volatility in the global financial markets. These events did not have an impact on our operating results. We continuously monitor and manage balance sheet and operational risks from clients in our portfolio, including their settlement obligations. Russia & Ukraine. During the quarter ended March 31, 2022, economic sanctions were imposed on Russia by the U.S., European Union, United Kingdom and other jurisdictions and authorities, impacting Visa and its clients. In March 2022, we suspended our operations in Russia and as a result, are no longer generating revenue from domestic and cross-border activities related to Russia. For the three months ended March 31, 2022, total net revenues from Russia, including revenues driven by domestic as well as cross-border activities, was approximately 4% of our consolidated net revenues. The continuing effects of the recent liquidity issues at certain financial institutions and the war in Ukraine are difficult to predict due to numerous uncertainties identified in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022 . We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business. Highlights for the first half of fiscal 2023. For the three and six months ended March 31, 2023, net revenues increased 11% and 12% over the prior-year comparable periods, respectively, primarily due to the growth in nominal cross-border volume, processed transactions and nominal payments volume, partially offset by higher client incentives. During the three and six months ended March 31, 2023, exchange rate movements lowered our net revenues growth by approximately two percentage points. See Results of Operations—Net Revenues below for further discussion. For the three and six months ended March 31, 2023, GAAP operating expenses increased 11% and 18% over the prior-year comparable periods, respectively, primarily due to higher expenses related to personnel. For the six months ended March 31, 2023, GAAP operating expenses also included higher litigation provision. See Results of Operations—Operating Expenses below for further discussion. During the six months ended March 31, 2023, exchange rate movements lowered our operating expense growth by approximately one percentage point. 29 Table of Contents For the three and six months ended March 31, 2023, non-GAAP operating expenses increased 13% and 14% over the prior-year comparable periods, respectively, primarily due to higher expenses related to personnel. For the six months ended March 31, 2023, non-GAAP operating expenses also included higher general and administrative expenses. Interchange multidistrict litigation. During the six months ended March 31, 2023, we recorded an additional accrual of $341 million to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. We also made deposits of $350 million into the U.S. litigation escrow account. See Note 4—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 12—Legal Matters to our unaudited consolidated financial statements . Common stock repurchases. In October 2022, our board of directors authorized a $12.0 billion share repurchase program . During the six months ended March 31, 2023, we repurchased 26 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market for $5.3 billion. As of March 31, 2023, our repurchase programs had remaining authorized funds of $11.9 billion. See Note 8—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Non-GAAP financial results. We use non-GAAP financial measures of our performance which exclude certain items which we believe are not representative of our continuing operations, as they may be non-recurring or have no cash impact, and may distort our longer-term operating trends. We consider non-GAAP measures useful to investors because they provide greater transparency into management’s view and assessment of our ongoing operating performance. • Gains and losses on equity investments. Gains and losses on equity investments include periodic non-cash fair value adjustments and gains and losses upon sale of an investment. These long-term investments are strategic in nature and are primarily private company investments. Gains and losses and the related tax impacts associated with these investments are tied to the performance of the companies that we invest in and therefore do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business. • Amortization of acquired intangible assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, customer relationships and brands acquired in connection with business combinations executed beginning in fiscal 2019. Amortization charges for our acquired intangible assets are non-cash and are significantly affected by the timing, frequency and size of our acquisitions, rather than our core operations. As such, we have excluded this amount and the related tax impact to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance. • Acquisition-related costs. Acquisition-related costs consist primarily of one-time transaction and integration costs associated with our business combinations. These costs include professional fees, technology integration fees, restructuring activities and other direct costs related to the purchase and integration of acquired entities. These costs also include retention equity and deferred equity compensation when they are agreed upon as part of the purchase price of the transaction but are required to be recognized as expense post-combination. We have excluded these amounts and the related tax impacts as the expenses are recognized for a limited duration and do not reflect the underlying performance of our business. • Litigation provision. During the six months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, we recorded additional accruals to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation of $341 million and $145 million, respectively, and related tax benefit of $76 million and $32 million, respectively, determined by applying applicable tax rates. Under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, we recover the monetary liabilities related to the U.S. covered litigation through a downward adjustment to the rate at which shares of our class B common stock convert into shares of class A common stock. See Note 4—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 12—Legal Matters to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. • Russia-Ukraine charges . During the three and six months ended March 31, 2022, we recorded a loss within general and administrative expense of $35 million from the deconsolidation of our Russian subsidiary. We also incurred charges of $25 million in personnel expense as a result of steps taken to support our employees in Russia and Ukraine. We have excluded these amounts and the related tax benefit of $4 million, determined by applying applicable tax rates, as they are one-time charges and do not reflect the underlying performance of our business. 30 Table of Contents Non-GAAP operating expenses, non-operating income (expense), income tax provision, effective income tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share should not be relied upon as substitutes for, or considered in isolation from, measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Effective income tax rate, diluted earnings per share and their respective totals are calculated based on unrounded numbers. 32 Table of Contents Payments volume and processed transactions. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues. Payments volume represents the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, V PAY and Interlink brands and excludes Europe co-badged volume. Nominal payments volume is denominated in U.S. dollars and is calculated each quarter by applying an established U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rate for each local currency in which our volumes are reported. Processed transactions represent transactions using cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, V PAY, Interlink and PLUS brands processed on Visa’s networks. The following table presents nominal payments and cash volume: U.S. International Visa Inc.

Therefore, service revenues reported for the three and six months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, were based on nominal payments volume reported by our financial institution clients for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. On occasion, previously presented volume information may be updated. Prior-period updates are not material. (2) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes and totals are calculated based on unrounded numbers. (3) Includes consumer prepaid volume and Interlink volume. (4) Includes large, medium and small business credit and debit, as well as commercial prepaid volume. (5) Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. (6) Total nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution clients, subject to review by Visa. (7) Growth on a constant-dollar basis excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar. The following table presents the number of processed transactions: Three Months Ended March 31, Six Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 % Change (1) 2023 2022 % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Visa processed transactions 50,069 44,807 12 % 102,581 92,366 11 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage change is calculated based on unrounded numbers. On occasion, previously presented information may be updated. Prior period updates are not material. Results of Operations Net Revenues The following table presents our net revenues earned in the U.S. and internationally: Three Months Ended March 31, Six Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 % Change (1) 2023 2022 % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) U.S. $ 3,540 $ 3,079 15 % $ 7,107 $ 6,257 14 % International 4,445 4,110 8 % 8,814 7,991 10 % Net revenues $ 7,985 $ 7,189 11 % $ 15,921 $ 14,248 12 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. Net revenues increased during the three and six-month comparable periods primarily due to the growth in nominal cross-border volume, processed transactions and nominal payments volume, partially offset by higher client incentives. 34 Table of Contents Our net revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. During the three and six months ended March 31, 2023, exchange rate movements lowered our net revenues growth by approximately two percentage points. The following table presents the components of our net revenues: Three Months Ended March 31, Six Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 % Change (1) 2023 2022 % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Service revenues $ 3,771 $ 3,521 7 % $ 7,282 $ 6,714 8 % Data processing revenues 3,819 3,480 10 % 7,646 7,094 8 % International transaction revenues 2,749 2,208 24 % 5,546 4,382 27 % Other revenues 551 474 16 % 1,138 923 23 % Client incentives (2,905) (2,494) 16 % (5,691) (4,865) 17 % Net revenues $ 7,985 $ 7,189 11 % $ 15,921 $ 14,248 12 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. • Service revenues increased primarily due to 2% and 3% growth in nominal payments volume during the three and six-month comparable periods, respectively, despite the impact of our suspension of operations in Russia. Service revenues also increased due to business mix and select pricing modifications. • Data processing revenues increased primarily due to overall growth in processed transactions of 12% and 11% during the three and six-month comparable periods, respectively, partially offset by our suspension of operations in Russia. • International transaction revenues increased primarily due to growth in nominal cross-border volumes of 27% and 25% during the three and six-month comparable periods, respectively, excluding transactions within Europe. International transaction revenues also increased due to volatility of a broad range of currencies and select pricing modifications, partially offset by business mix. • Other revenues increased primarily due to value added services revenues tied to marketing and consulting services. Other revenues also increased due to acquisition-related revenues. • Client incentives increased primarily due to growth in payments volume during the three and six-month comparable periods. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. 35 Table of Contents Operating Expenses The following table presents the components of our total operating expenses: Three Months Ended March 31, Six Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 % Change (1) 2023 2022 % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Personnel $ 1,515 $ 1,226 24 % $ 2,852 $ 2,351 21 % Marketing 309 314 (2 %) 641 594 8 % Network and processing 179 190 (6 %) 357 380 (6 %) Professional fees 130 125 5 % 239 225 7 % Depreciation and amortization 234 207 13 % 461 405 14 % General and administrative 282 325 (13 %) 604 567 6 % Litigation provision — — NM 341 148 131 % Total operating expenses $ 2,649 $ 2,387 11 % $ 5,495 $ 4,670 18 % NM - Not meaningful (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. • Personnel expenses increased primarily due to higher number of employees and compensation, reflecting our strategy to invest in future growth, including acquisitions. • Marketing expenses increased during the six months ended March 31, 2023 primarily due to increased spending in various campaigns, including the FIFA World Cup 2022 TM and client marketing. The increase was partially offset by the absence of spending for the Beijing 2022 Olympic Winter Games in the current period. • Network and processing expenses decreased primarily due to the absence of fees associated with the processing of Russian domestic transactions as a result of our suspension of operations in Russia, partially offset by continued technology and processing network investments to support growth. • Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additional depreciation and amortization from our acquisitions and on-going investments. • General and administrative expenses decreased during the three months ended March 31, 2023 primarily due to the absence of expenses as a result of the suspension of our operations in Russia. During the six months ended March 31, 2023, expenses increased primarily due to an increase in travel expenses and higher usage of travel related card benefits, partially offset by the absence of expenses as a result of the suspension of our operations in Russia. • Litigation provision increased during the six months ended March 31, 2023 primarily due to an increase in accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation. See Note 12—Legal Matters to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. 36 Table of Contents Non-operating Income (Expense) The following table presents the components of our non-operating income (expense): Three Months Ended March 31, Six Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 % Change (1) 2023 2022 % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Interest expense $ (142) $ (134) 6 % $ (279) $ (268) 4 % Investment income (expense) and other 84 (126) (167 %) 108 129 (16 %) Total non-operating income (expense) $ (58) $ (260) (78 %) $ (171) $ (139) 23 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. • Interest expense increased during the three and six months ended March 31, 2023 primarily driven by lower gains from derivative instruments, partially offset by lower interest related to indirect taxes. • Investment income (expense) and other increased during the three months ended March 31, 2023 primarily due to higher interest income on our cash and investments and lower losses on our equity investments. Investment income and other decreased during the six months ended March 31, 2023 primarily due to losses on our investments, offset by higher interest income on our cash and investments. Effective Income Tax Rate The following table presents our effective income tax rates: Three Months Ended March 31, Six Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 2023 2022 Effective income tax rate 19 % 20 % 18 % 19 % The difference in the effective tax rates is primarily due to a $142 million tax benefit related to prior years recognized during the six months ended March 31, 2023 due to the reassessment of an uncertain tax position as a result of new information obtained during an ongoing tax examination. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Data The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the periods presented: Six Months Ended March 31, 2023 2022 (in millions) Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 8,031 $ 7,721 Investing activities (835) (2,332) Financing activities (9,273) (8,367) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents 828 (305) Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents $ (1,249) $ (3,283) Operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended March 31, 2023 was higher than the prior-year comparable period primarily due to growth in our underlying business, partially offset by higher incentive payments. 37 Table of Contents Investing activities. Cash used in investing activities for the six months ended March 31, 2023 was lower than the prior-year comparable period primarily due to the absence of cash paid for acquisitions, combined with cash received from the settlement of net investment hedge derivative instruments in the current year, partially offset by higher purchases, net of maturities and sales, of investment securities. Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities for the six months ended March 31, 2023 was higher than the prior-year comparable period primarily due to the principal debt payment upon maturity of our December 2022 senior notes, the absence of proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper and higher dividends paid, partially offset by lower share repurchases. See Note 6—Debt and Note 8—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements . Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings and the returns that these holdings provide. Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our current and projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances. Uses of Liquidity There has been no significant change to our primary uses of liquidity since September 30, 2022, except as discussed below. Common stock repurchases. During the six months ended March 31, 2023, we repurchased shares of our class A common stock in the open market for $5.3 billion. As of March 31, 2023, our repurchase programs had remaining authorized funds of $11.9 billion. See Note 8—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Dividends . During the six months ended March 31, 2023, we declared and paid $1.9 billion in dividends to holders of our common and preferred stock. On April 25, 2023, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.45 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and series A, B and C convertible participating preferred stock on an as-converted basis). See Note 8—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. All preferred and class B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends. Senior notes . During the six months ended March 31, 2023, we repaid $2.25 billion of principal upon maturity of our December 2022 senior notes. See Note 6—Debt to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Litigation. During the six months ended March 31, 2023, we deposited $350 million into the U.S. litigation escrow account to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. The balance of this account as of March 31, 2023 was $1.6 billion and is reflected as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 4—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 12—Legal Matters to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued certain accounting updates, which we have either determined to be not applicable or not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Organization. Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries (Visa or the Company) is a global payments technology company that facilitates global commerce and money movement across more than 200 countries and territories. Visa operates one of the world’s largest electronic payments network — VisaNet — which provides transaction processing services (primarily authorization, clearing and settlement). The Company offers products, solutions and services that facilitate secure, reliable and efficient money movement for participants in the ecosystem. Visa is not a financial institution and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders of Visa products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, Visa’s financial institution clients. Consolidation and basis of presentation. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). The Company consolidates its majority-owned and controlled entities, including variable interest entities (VIEs) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company’s investments in VIEs have not been material to its unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirements for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and, consequently, do not include all of the annual disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. Reference should be made to the Visa Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022 for additional disclosures, including a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. Use of estimates. The preparation of the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained, and will be recognized in the period in which such changes occur. Future actual results could differ materially from these estimates. 10 Table of Contents VISA INC.

The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the U.S. litigation escrow account balance. See Note 12—Legal Matters . 11 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) The following table presents the changes in the restricted cash equivalents—U.S. litigation escrow account: Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 (in millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 1,449 $ 894 Deposits into the litigation escrow account 350 250 Payments to opt-out merchants (1) , net of interest earned on escrow funds ( 94 ) — Balance at end of period $ 1,705 $ 1,144 (1) These payments are associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. See Note 12—Legal Matters . Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plan Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rates in the Visa Europe territory (VE territory covered litigation). Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover certain losses resulting from VE territory covered litigation (VE territory covered losses) through a periodic adjustment to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the series B and C preferred stock. VE territory covered losses are recorded in a contra-equity account referred to as “right to recover for covered losses” within stockholders’ equity before the corresponding adjustment to the applicable conversion rate is effected. Adjustments to the conversion rate may be executed once in any six-month period unless a single, individual loss greater than € 20 million is incurred, in which case, the six-month limitation does not apply. When the adjustment to the conversion rate is made, the amount previously recorded in “right to recover for covered losses” as contra-equity is then recorded against the book value of the preferred stock within stockholders’ equity. The following table presents the activities related to VE territory covered losses in preferred stock and “right to recover for covered losses” within stockholders’ equity: Preferred Stock Right to Recover for Covered Losses Series B Series C (in millions) Balance as of September 30, 2022 $ 460 $ 812 $ ( 35 ) VE territory covered losses incurred (1) — — ( 8 ) Recovery through conversion rate adjustment (2) ( 7 ) ( 7 ) 15 Balance as of December 31, 2022 $ 453 $ 805 $ ( 28 ) Preferred Stock Right to Recover for Covered Losses Series B Series C (in millions) Balance as of September 30, 2021 $ 1,071 $ 1,523 $ ( 133 ) VE territory covered losses incurred (1) — — ( 7 ) Recovery through conversion rate adjustment ( 26 ) ( 3 ) 29 Balance as of December 31, 2021 $ 1,045 $ 1,520 $ ( 111 ) (1) VE territory covered losses incurred reflect settlements with merchants and additional legal costs. See Note 12—Legal Matters . (2) Adjustment to right to recover for covered losses for the conversion rate adjustment differs from the actual recovered amount due to differences in foreign exchange rates between the time the losses were incurred and the subsequent recovery through the conversion rate adjustment. 12 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) The following table presents the as-converted value of the preferred stock available to recover VE territory covered losses compared to the book value of preferred stock recorded in stockholders’ equity within the Company’s consolidated balance sheets: December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 As-converted Value of Preferred Stock (1),(2) Book Value of Preferred Stock (1) As-converted Value of Preferred Stock (1),(3) Book Value of Preferred Stock (1) (in millions) Series B preferred stock $ 1,524 $ 453 $ 1,309 $ 460 Series C preferred stock 2,383 805 2,044 812 Total 3,907 1,258 3,353 1,272 Less: right to recover for covered losses ( 28 ) ( 28 ) ( 35 ) ( 35 ) Total recovery for covered losses available $ 3,879 $ 1,230 $ 3,318 $ 1,237 (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

These investments are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis and are classified as Level 3 due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and the fact that inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require management’s judgment. 15 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) The following table summarizes the total carrying value of the Company’s non-marketable equity securities held as of December 31, 2022 including cumulative unrealized gains and losses: December 31, 2022 (in millions) Initial cost basis $ 739 Adjustments: Upward adjustments 827 Downward adjustments (including impairment) ( 349 ) Carrying amount, end of period $ 1,217 Unrealized gains and losses included in the carrying value of the Company’s non-marketable equity securities still held as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows: Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 (in millions) Upward adjustments $ 17 $ 224 Downward adjustments (including impairment) $ — $ — For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized net unrealized losses of $ 102 million and net unrealized gains of $ 172 million, respectively, on marketable and non-marketable equity securities still held as of quarter end. Other Fair Value Disclosures Debt. Debt instruments are measured at amortized cost on the Company’s unaudited consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the debt instruments, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. As of December 31, 2022, the carrying value and estimated fair value of debt was $ 20.5 billion and $ 18.4 billion, respectively. As of September 30, 2022, the carrying value and estimated fair value of debt was $ 22.5 billion and $ 19.9 billion, respectively. Other financial instruments not measured at fair value. As of December 31, 2022, the carrying values of settlement receivable and payable and customer collateral are an approximate fair value due to their generally short maturities. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Non-financial assets. Certain non-financial assets such as goodwill, intangible assets and property, equipment and technology are subject to non-recurring fair value measurements if they are deemed to be impaired. As of December 31, 2022, there were no impairment indicators. 16 Table of Contents VISA INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) Note 7—Settlement Guarantee Management The Company indemnifies its clients for settlement losses suffered due to failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa operating rules. This indemnification creates settlement risk for the Company due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. Historically, the Company has experienced minimal losses as a result of its settlement risk guarantee. However, the Company’s future obligations, which could be material under its guarantees, are not determinable as they are dependent upon future events. The Company’s settlement exposure is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time, which vary significantly day to day. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company’s maximum daily settlement exposure was $ 123.5 billion and the average daily settlement exposure was $ 76.0 billion. The Company maintains and regularly reviews global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement exposure, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. The Company held the following collateral to manage settlement exposure: December 31, 2022 September 30, 2022 (in millions) Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents $ 2,591 $ 2,342 Pledged securities at market value 255 213 Letters of credit 1,659 1,582 Guarantees 984 950 Total $ 5,489 $ 5,087 18 Table of Contents VISA INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) Note 11—Income Taxes For the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the effective income tax rates were 16 % and 19 %, respectively. The difference in the effective tax rates is primarily due to a $ 142 million tax benefit related to prior years recognized during the three months ended December 31, 2022 due to the reassessment of an uncertain tax position as a result of new information obtained during an ongoing tax examination. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company’s gross and net unrecognized tax benefits decreased by $ 108 million and $ 149 million, respectively. The decrease in unrecognized tax benefits is primarily related to the reassessment mentioned above, partially offset by an increase in gross timing differences as well as various tax positions across several jurisdictions. The Company’s tax filings are subject to examination by U.S. federal, state and foreign taxing authorities. The timing and outcome of the final resolutions of the various ongoing income tax examinations are highly uncertain. It is not reasonably possible to estimate the increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. Note 12—Legal Matters The Company is party to various legal and regulatory proceedings. Some of these proceedings involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. For those proceedings where a loss is determined to be only reasonably possible or probable but not estimable, the Company has disclosed the nature of the claim. Additionally, unless otherwise disclosed below with respect to these proceedings, the Company cannot provide an estimate of the possible loss or range of loss. Although the Company believes that it has strong defenses for the litigation and regulatory proceedings described below, it could, in the future, incur judgments or fines or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. From time to time, the Company may engage in settlement discussions or mediations with respect to one or more of its outstanding litigation matters, either on its own behalf or collectively with other parties. The litigation accrual is an estimate and is based on management’s understanding of its litigation profile, the specifics of each case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management’s best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date. The following table summarizes the activity related to accrued litigation: Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 (in millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 1,456 $ 983 Provision for uncovered legal matters — 1 Provision for covered legal matters 347 146 Payments for legal matters ( 101 ) ( 103 ) Balance at end of period $ 1,702 $ 1,027 Accrual Summary—U.S. Covered Litigation Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A. and Visa International are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, which the Company refers to as the U.S. covered litigation. An accrual for the U.S. covered litigation and a charge to the litigation provision are recorded when a loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. In making this determination, the Company evaluates available information, including but not limited to actions taken by the Company’s litigation committee. The total accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the escrow account balance. See further discussion below under U.S. Covered Litigation and Note 4—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans. 22 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) The following table summarizes the accrual activity related to U.S. covered litigation: Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 (in millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 1,441 $ 881 Provision for interchange multidistrict litigation 341 145 Payments for U.S. covered litigation ( 101 ) — Balance at end of period $ 1,681 $ 1,026 During the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded an additional accrual of $ 341 million and deposited $ 350 million into the U.S. litigation escrow account to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. The U.S. covered litigation accrual balance is consistent with the Company’s best estimate of its share of a probable and reasonably estimable loss with respect to U.S. covered litigation. While this estimate is consistent with the Company’s view of the current status of the litigation, the probable and reasonably estimable loss or range of such loss could materially vary based on developments in the litigation. The Company will continue to consider and reevaluate this estimate in light of the substantial uncertainties with respect to the litigation. The Company is unable to estimate a potential loss or range of loss, if any, at trial if negotiated resolutions cannot be reached. Accrual Summary—VE Territory Covered Litigation Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the Europe retrospective responsibility plan. Unlike the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Europe retrospective responsibility plan does not have an escrow account that is used to fund settlements or judgments. The Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through periodic adjustments to the conversion rates applicable to the series B and C preferred stock. An accrual for the VE territory covered losses and a reduction to stockholders’ equity will be recorded when the loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. See further discussion below under VE Territory Covered Litigation and Note 4—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . The following table summarizes the accrual activity related to VE territory covered litigation: Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 (in millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 11 $ 102 Provision for VE territory covered litigation 6 1 Payments for VE territory covered litigation — ( 102 ) Balance at end of period $ 17 $ 1 U.S. Covered Litigation Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) - Individual Merchant Actions Visa has reached settlements with a number of merchants representing approximately 62 % of the Visa-branded payment card sales volume of merchants who opted out of the Amended Settlement Agreement with the Damages Class plaintiffs. 23 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) VE Territory Covered Litigation Europe Merchant Litigation Since July 2013, proceedings have been commenced by more than 900 Merchants (the capitalized term “Merchant” when used in this section, means a Merchant together with subsidiary/affiliate companies that are party to the same claim) against Visa Europe, Visa Inc. and other Visa subsidiaries in the UK and other countries primarily relating to interchange rates in Europe and in some cases relating to fees charged by Visa and certain Visa rules. As of the filing date, Visa has settled the claims asserted by over 150 Merchants, and there are approximately 700 Merchants with outstanding claims. In addition, over 30 additional Merchants have threatened to commence similar proceedings. Standstill agreements have been entered into with respect to some of those threatened Merchant claims, several of which have been settled. Other Litigation EMV Chip Liability Shift On November 30, 2022, Visa, jointly with other defendants, served a motion for summary judgment regarding the claims in the amended complaint and a motion to decertify the class. U.S. Department of Justice Civil Investigative Demand (2021) On January 4, 2023, the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (Division) issued a further Civil Investigative Demand seeking additional documents and information focusing on U.S. debit and competition with other payment methods and networks. Visa is cooperating with the Division in connection with the investigation. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Litigation On December 21, 2022, plaintiffs filed a third amended complaint asserting the same claims as asserted in the prior complaints. European Commission Client Incentive Agreements Investigation On December 2, 2022, the European Commission (EC) informed Visa that it had opened a preliminary investigation into Visa’s incentive agreements with clients. Visa is cooperating with the EC in connection with the investigation. Consumer Interchange Litigation On December 30, 2022, a putative class action was filed in California state court against Visa, Mastercard, and certain financial institutions on behalf of all Visa and Mastercard cardholders in California who made a purchase using a Visa-branded or Mastercard-branded payment card in California from January 1, 2004. Plaintiffs primarily allege a conspiracy to fix interchange fees and seek injunctive relief, attorneys’ fees and damages as direct and indirect purchasers based on alleged violations of California law. On January 11, 2023, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint asserting the same claims as asserted in the prior complaint. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This management’s discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity and capital resources of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries (Visa, we, us, our or the Company) on a historical basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings, as well as those factors that may affect future earnings. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 1—Financial Statements of this report. Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that relate to, among other things, the impact on our future financial position, results of operations and cash flows as a result of the war in Ukraine; the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the reopening of borders and resumption of international travel; prospects, developments, strategies and growth of our business; anticipated expansion of our products in certain countries; industry developments; anticipated timing and benefits of our acquisitions; expectations regarding litigation matters, investigations and proceedings; timing and amount of stock repurchases; sufficiency of sources of liquidity and funding; effectiveness of our risk management programs; and expectations regarding the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements. Forward-looking statements generally are identified by words such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,” “projects,” “could,” “should,” “will,” “continue” and other similar expressions. All statements other than statements of historical fact could be forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made, are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. We describe risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, any of these forward-looking statements in our SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the year ended September 30, 2022, and any subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K. Except as required by law, we do not intend to update or revise any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. 25 Table of Contents Overview Visa is a global payments technology company that facilitates global commerce and money movement across more than 200 countries and territories among a global set of consumers, merchants, financial institutions and government entities through innovative technologies.

Russia & Ukraine. During the quarter ended March 31, 2022, economic sanctions were imposed on Russia by the U.S., European Union, United Kingdom and other jurisdictions and authorities, impacting Visa and its clients. In March 2022, we suspended our operations in Russia and as a result, are no longer generating revenue from domestic and cross-border activities related to Russia. For the three months ended December 31, 2021, total net revenues from Russia, including revenues driven by domestic as well as cross-border activities, was approximately 4% of our consolidated net revenues. The continuing effects of the war in Ukraine are difficult to predict due to numerous uncertainties identified in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2022 . We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business. Highlights for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, net revenues increased 12% over the prior-year comparable period, primarily due to the growth in nominal cross-border volume, processed transactions and nominal payments volume, partially offset by higher client incentives. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, exchange rate movements negatively impacted our net revenues growth by approximately three percentage points. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, GAAP operating expenses increased 25% over the prior-year comparable period primarily due to higher expenses related to personnel and litigation provision. See Results of Operations—Operating Expenses below for further discussion. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, exchange rate movements positively impacted our operating expense growth by approximately one-and-a-half percentage points. For the three months ended December 31, 2022, non-GAAP operating expenses increased 15% over the prior year comparable period primarily due to higher personnel and general and administrative expenses. 26 Table of Contents Interchange multidistrict litigation. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we recorded an additional accrual of $341 million to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. We also made deposits of $350 million into the U.S. litigation escrow account. See Note 4—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 12—Legal Matters to our unaudited consolidated financial statements . Common stock repurchases. In October 2022, our board of directors authorized a $12.0 billion share repurchase program . Previously, in December 2021, our board of directors authorized a $12.0 billion share repurchase program. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased 16 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market for $3.1 billion. As of December 31, 2022, our repurchase programs had remaining authorized funds of $14.1 billion. See Note 8—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Non-GAAP financial results. We use non-GAAP financial measures of our performance which exclude certain items which we believe are not representative of our continuing operations, as they may be non-recurring or have no cash impact, and may distort our longer-term operating trends. We consider non-GAAP measures useful to investors because they provide greater transparency into management’s view and assessment of our ongoing operating performance. • Gains and losses on equity investments. Gains and losses on equity investments include periodic non-cash fair value adjustments and gains and losses upon sale of an investment. These long-term investments are strategic in nature and are primarily private company investments. Gains and losses and the related tax impacts associated with these investments are tied to the performance of the companies that we invest in and therefore do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business. • Amortization of acquired intangible assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, customer relationships and brands acquired in connection with business combinations executed beginning in fiscal 2019. Amortization charges for our acquired intangible assets are non-cash and are significantly affected by the timing, frequency and size of our acquisitions, rather than our core operations. As such, we have excluded this amount and the related tax impact to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance. • Acquisition-related costs. Acquisition-related costs consist primarily of one-time transaction and integration costs associated with our business combinations. These costs include professional fees, technology integration fees, restructuring activities and other direct costs related to the purchase and integration of acquired entities. These costs also include retention equity and deferred equity compensation when they are agreed upon as part of the purchase price of the transaction but are required to be recognized as expense post-combination. We have excluded these amounts and the related tax impacts as the expenses are recognized for a limited duration and do not reflect the underlying performance of our business. • Litigation provision. During the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded an additional accrual to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation of $341 million and $145 million, respectively, and related tax benefit of $76 million and $32 million, respectively, determined by applying applicable tax rates. Under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, we recover the monetary liabilities related to the U.S. covered litigation through a downward adjustment to the rate at which shares of our class B common stock convert into shares of class A common stock. See Note 4—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 12—Legal Matters to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. 27 Table of Contents Non-GAAP operating expenses, non-operating income (expense), income tax provision, effective income tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share should not be relied upon as substitutes for, or considered in isolation from, measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following tables reconcile our as-reported financial measures, calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to our respective non-GAAP financial measures: Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 Operating Expenses Non-operating Income (Expense) Income Tax Provision Effective Income Tax Rate (1) Net Income Diluted Earnings Per Share (1) (in millions, except percentages and per share data) As reported $ 2,846 $ (113) $ 798 16.0 % $ 4,179 $ 1.99 (Gains) losses on equity investments, net — 106 24 82 0.04 Amortization of acquired intangible assets (43) — 9 34 0.02 Acquisition-related costs (23) — 2 21 0.01 Litigation provision (341) — 76 265 0.13 Non-GAAP $ 2,439 $ (7) $ 909 16.5 % $ 4,581 $ 2.18 Three Months Ended December 31, 2021 Operating Expenses Non-operating Income (Expense) Income Tax Provision Effective Income Tax Rate (1) Net Income Diluted Earnings Per Share (1) (in millions, except percentages and per share data) As reported $ 2,283 $ 121 $ 938 19.1 % $ 3,959 $ 1.83 (Gains) losses on equity investments, net — (231) (42) (189) (0.09) Amortization of acquired intangible assets (13) — 3 10 — Acquisition-related costs (10) — 2 8 — Litigation provision (145) — 32 113 0.05 Non-GAAP $ 2,115 $ (110) $ 933 19.3 % $ 3,901 $ 1.81 (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Effective income tax rate, diluted earnings per share and their respective totals are calculated based on unrounded numbers. Payments volume and processed transactions. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues. Payments volume represents the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, V PAY and Interlink brands and excludes Europe co-badged volume. Nominal payments volume is denominated in U.S. dollars and is calculated each quarter by applying an established U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rate for each local currency in which our volumes are reported. Processed transactions represent transactions using cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, V PAY, Interlink and PLUS brands processed on Visa’s networks. 28 Table of Contents The following table presents nominal payments and cash volume: U.S. International Visa Inc. Three Months Ended September 30, (1) Three Months Ended September 30, (1) Three Months Ended September 30, (1) 2022 2021 % Change (2) 2022 2021 % Change (2) 2022 2021 % Change (2) (in billions, except percentages) Nominal payments volume Consumer credit $ 551 $ 480 15 % $ 684 $ 652 5 % $ 1,236 $ 1,132 9 % Consumer debit (3) 682 640 6 % 635 692 (8 %) 1,317 1,332 (1 %) Commercial (4) 247 206 20 % 130 118 11 % 377 323 17 % Total nominal payments volume (2) $ 1,480 $ 1,326 12 % $ 1,449 $ 1,461 (1 %) $ 2,929 $ 2,787 5 % Cash volume (5) 155 179 (13 %) 451 496 (9 %) 606 675 (10 %) Total nominal volume (2),(6) $ 1,635 $ 1,505 9 % $ 1,900 $ 1,958 (3 %) $ 3,535 $ 3,462 2 % The following table presents the change in nominal and constant payments and cash volume: International Visa Inc.

Therefore, service revenues reported for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, were based on nominal payments volume reported by our financial institution clients for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. On occasion, previously presented volume information may be updated. Prior-period updates are not material. (2) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes and totals are calculated based on unrounded numbers. (3) Includes consumer prepaid volume and Interlink volume. (4) Includes large, medium and small business credit and debit, as well as commercial prepaid volume. (5) Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. (6) Total nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution clients, subject to review by Visa. (7) Growth on a constant-dollar basis excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar. The following table presents the number of processed transactions: Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Visa processed transactions 52,512 47,558 10 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage change is calculated based on unrounded numbers. On occasion, previously presented information may be updated. Prior period updates are not material. 29 Table of Contents Results of Operations Net Revenues The following table presents our net revenues earned in the U.S. and internationally: Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) U.S. $ 3,567 $ 3,178 12 % International 4,369 3,881 13 % Net revenues $ 7,936 $ 7,059 12 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. Net revenues increased primarily due to the growth in nominal cross-border volume, processed transactions and nominal payments volume, partially offset by higher client incentives. Our net revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, exchange rate movements negatively impacted our net revenues growth by approximately three percentage points. The following table presents the components of our net revenues: Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Service revenues $ 3,511 $ 3,193 10 % Data processing revenues 3,827 3,614 6 % International transaction revenues 2,797 2,174 29 % Other revenues 587 449 31 % Client incentives (2,786) (2,371) 18 % Net revenues $ 7,936 $ 7,059 12 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. • Service revenues increased primarily due to 5% growth in nominal payments volume, despite the impact of our suspension of operations in Russia. Service revenues also increased due to business mix, select pricing modifications and card benefits. • Data processing revenues increased primarily due to overall growth in processed transactions of 10%, partially offset by our suspension of operations in Russia. • International transaction revenues increased primarily due to growth in nominal cross-border volumes of 22%, excluding transactions within Europe. International transaction revenues also increased due to volatility of a broad range of currencies and select pricing modifications. • Other revenues increased primarily due to value added services revenues tied to marketing and consulting services, acquisition-related revenues and select pricing modifications. • Client incentives increased primarily due to growth in payments volume. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. 30 Table of Contents Operating Expenses The following table presents the components of our total operating expenses: Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Personnel $ 1,337 $ 1,125 19 % Marketing 332 280 18 % Network and processing 178 190 (6 %) Professional fees 109 100 9 % Depreciation and amortization 227 198 15 % General and administrative 322 242 33 % Litigation provision 341 148 130 % Total operating expenses $ 2,846 $ 2,283 25 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. • Personnel expenses increased primarily due to higher number of employees and compensation, reflecting our strategy to invest in future growth, including acquisitions. • Marketing expenses increased primarily due to increased spending in various campaigns, including the FIFA World Cup 2022 TM and client marketing. • Network and processing expenses decreased primarily due to the absence of fees associated with the processing of Russian domestic transactions as a result of our suspension of operations in Russia, partially offset by continued technology and processing network investments to support growth. • Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additional depreciation and amortization from our acquisitions and on-going investments. • General and administrative expenses increased primarily due to an increase in travel expenses, unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations, and higher usage of travel related card benefits. • Litigation provision increased primarily due to an increase in accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation. See Note 12—Legal Matters to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Non-operating Income (Expense) The following table presents the components of our non-operating income (expense): Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Interest expense $ (137) $ (134) 2 % Investment income (expense) and other 24 255 (91 %) Total non-operating income (expense) $ (113) $ 121 (194 %) (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. • Interest expense increased primarily due to lower income from derivative instruments and higher interest expense related to the issuance of debt in fiscal 2022, partially offset by a discrete tax benefit recognized during the three months ended December 31, 2022. • Investment income (expense) and other decreased primarily due to losses on our equity investments, partially offset by higher interest income on our cash and investments. 31 Table of Contents Effective Income Tax Rate The following table presents our effective income tax rates: Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Effective income tax rate 16 % 19 % The difference in the effective tax rates is primarily due to a $142 million tax benefit related to prior years recognized during the three months ended December 31, 2022 due to the reassessment of an uncertain tax position as a result of new information obtained during an ongoing tax examination. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Data The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the periods presented: Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 2021 (in millions) Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 4,171 $ 4,232 Investing activities (510) (547) Financing activities (6,347) (4,967) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents 692 (194) Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents $ (1,994) $ (1,476) Operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was lower than the prior-year comparable period primarily due to higher incentive payments, partially offset by continued growth in our underlying business. Investing activities. Cash used in investing activities for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was lower than the prior-year comparable period primarily due to the absence of cash paid for acquisitions combined with cash received from the settlement of net investment hedge derivative instruments in the current year, partially offset by higher purchases, net of sales and maturities, of investment securities. Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities for the three months ended December 31, 2022 was higher than the prior-year comparable period primarily due to the principal debt payment upon maturity of our December 2022 senior notes and higher dividends paid, partially offset by lower share repurchases. See Note 6—Debt and Note 8—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements . Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings and the returns that these holdings provide. Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our current and projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances. 32 Table of Contents Uses of Liquidity There has been no significant change to our primary uses of liquidity since September 30, 2022, except as discussed below. Common stock repurchases. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we repurchased shares of our class A common stock in the open market for $3.1 billion. As of December 31, 2022, our repurchase programs had remaining authorized funds of $14.1 billion. See Note 8—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Dividends . During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we declared and paid $945 million in dividends to holders of our common and preferred stock. On January 24, 2023, our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.45 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and series A, B and C convertible participating preferred stock on an as-converted basis). See Note 8—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. All preferred and class B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends. Senior notes . During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we repaid $2.25 billion of principal upon maturity of our December 2022 senior notes. See Note 6—Debt to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Litigation. During the three months ended December 31, 2022, we deposited $350 million into the U.S. litigation escrow account to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. The balance of this account as of December 31, 2022 was $1.7 billion and is reflected as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 4—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 12—Legal Matters to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2020-04, which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. Subsequently, the FASB also issued amendments to this standard. The amendments in the ASU are effective upon issuance through December 31, 2024. The adoption of ASU 2020-04 and its subsequent amendments is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk There have been no significant changes to our market risks since September 30, 2022. ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Organization. Visa Inc. (“Visa” or the “Company”) is a global payments technology company that facilitates global commerce and money movement across more than 200 countries and territories. Visa and its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries operate one of the world’s largest electronic payments network — VisaNet — which provides transaction processing services (primarily authorization, clearing and settlement). The Company offers products and solutions that facilitate secure, reliable and efficient money movement for all participants in the ecosystem. Visa is not a financial institution and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders of Visa products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, Visa’s financial institution clients. Consolidation and basis of presentation. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The Company consolidates its majority-owned and controlled entities, including variable interest entities (“VIEs”) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company’s investments in VIEs have not been material to its unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. During the prior quarter, economic sanctions were imposed on Russia, impacting Visa and its clients. The extent and severity of the sanctions impacted the Company’s operations and a reduction in Ruble liquidity impacted the Company’s ability to manage operational impact and related foreign currency risk. In March 2022, the Company announced it was suspending its operations in Russia. In addition, the Company deconsolidated its Russian subsidiary, resulting in a pre-tax loss of $ 35 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2022, which is included in general and administrative expense on the consolidated statements of operations. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) requirements for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and, consequently, do not include all of the annual disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. Reference should be made to the Visa Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2021 for additional disclosures, including a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. Use of estimates. The preparation of the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained, and will be recognized in the period in which such changes occur. Future actual results could differ materially from these estimates. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2019-12, which simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in the existing guidance and making other minor improvements. The Company adopted this guidance effective October 1, 2021. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01, which clarifies that an entity should consider observable transactions that require it to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting for purposes of applying 12 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) the fair value measurement alternative. The Company adopted this guidance effective October 1, 2021. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Note 2—Acquisitions Currencycloud On December 20, 2021, Visa acquired The Currency Cloud Group Limited (“Currencycloud”), a UK-based global platform that enables banks and fintechs to provide innovative foreign exchange solutions for cross-border payments, for a total purchase consideration of $ 893 million (which includes the fair value of Visa’s previously held equity interest in Currencycloud). The Company allocated $ 150 million of the purchase consideration to technology, intangible assets, other net assets acquired and deferred tax liabilities and the remaining $ 743 million to goodwill. Tink On March 10, 2022, Visa acquired 100 % of the share capital of Tink AB (“Tink”) for $ 1.9 billion in cash. Tink is a European open banking platform that enables financial institutions, fintechs and merchants to build financial products and services and move money. The acquisition is expected to help accelerate the adoption of open banking around the world by providing a secure, reliable platform for innovation. Total purchase consideration has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and is subject to revision. If additional information becomes available, the Company may further revise the purchase price allocation as soon as practicable, but no later than one year from the acquisition date; however, at this time, material changes are not expected. The following table summarizes the purchase price allocation for Tink: Purchase Price Allocation Weighted-Average Useful Life (in millions) (in years) Technology $ 245 4 Customer relationships 90 6 Deferred tax liabilities ( 71 ) Other net assets acquired (liabilities assumed) 22 Goodwill 1,577 Total $ 1,863 5 Goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to be achieved from the acquisition and the assembled workforce. None of the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. 13 Table of Contents VISA INC.

These amounts are fully offset by corresponding liabilities recorded in accrued liabilities on the Company’s unaudited consolidated balance sheets. Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan Under the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Company maintains an escrow account from which settlements of, or judgments in, certain litigation referred to as the “U.S. covered litigation” are paid. The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the U.S. litigation escrow account balance. See Note 13—Legal Matters . 14 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) The following table presents the changes in the restricted cash equivalents—U.S. litigation escrow account: Nine Months Ended June 30, 2022 2021 (in millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 894 $ 901 Deposits into the litigation escrow account 850 — Payments to opt-out merchants (1) and interest earned on escrow funds ( 261 ) ( 7 ) Balance at end of period $ 1,483 $ 894 (1) These payments are associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. See Note 13—Legal Matters . Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plan Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rates in the Visa Europe territory (the “VE territory covered litigation”). Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover certain losses resulting from VE territory covered litigation (the “VE territory covered losses”) through a periodic adjustment to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the series B and C preferred stock. VE territory covered losses are recorded in “right to recover for covered losses” within stockholders’ equity before the corresponding adjustment to the applicable conversion rate is effected. Adjustments to the conversion rate may be executed once in any six-month period unless a single, individual loss greater than € 20 million is incurred, in which case, the six-month limitation does not apply. When the adjustment to the conversion rate is made, the amount previously recorded in “right to recover for covered losses” as contra-equity is then recorded against the book value of the preferred stock within stockholders’ equity.

As required by the litigation management deed, on June 21, 2022, the sixth anniversary of the Visa Europe acquisition, Visa, in consultation with the VE territories litigation management committee, carried out a release assessment. After the completion of this assessment, the Company announced on July 8, 2022 that it will release approximately $ 3.5 billion of the as-converted value from its series B and C preferred stock and will issue approximately 176,853 shares of series A preferred stock on July 29, 2022 (the “Sixth Anniversary Release”). Each holder of a share of series B and C preferred stock will receive a number of series A preferred stock equal to the applicable conversion adjustment divided by 100 . The Company will pay cash in lieu of issuing fractional shares of series A preferred stock. Each share of series A preferred stock will be automatically converted into 100 shares of class A common stock in connection with a sale to a person eligible to hold class A common stock in accordance with Visa’s certificate of incorporation. Effective July 29, 2022, the release will result in a downward adjustment to the series B and C conversion rates of 3.084 and 3.179 , respectively. 16 Table of Contents VISA INC.

Money market funds, marketable equity securities and U.S. Treasury securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The Company’s deferred compensation liability is measured at fair value based on marketable equity securities held under the deferred compensation plan. Level 2 assets and liabilities. The fair value of U.S. government-sponsored debt securities, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. Derivative instruments are valued using inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and U.S. Treasury securities. As of June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, gross unrealized gains and losses were not material. As of June 30, 2022, $ 3.4 billion of the Company’s debt securities are due within one year and $ 2.2 billion is due between one to five years. 17 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis Non-marketable equity securities. The Company’s non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. These investments are classified as Level 3 due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and the fact that inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require management’s judgment. The following table summarizes the total carrying value of the Company’s non-marketable equity securities held as of June 30, 2022 including cumulative unrealized gains and losses: June 30, 2022 (in millions) Initial cost basis $ 722 Adjustments: Upward adjustments 810 Downward adjustments (including impairment) ( 350 ) Carrying amount, end of period $ 1,182 Unrealized gains and losses included in the carrying value of the Company’s non-marketable equity securities still held as of June 30, 2022 and 2021 were as follows: Three Months Ended June 30, Nine Months Ended June 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 (in millions) Upward adjustments $ 5 $ 180 $ 231 $ 323 Downward adjustments (including impairment) $ ( 284 ) $ — $ ( 337 ) $ ( 2 ) For the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized net unrealized losses of $ 278 million, and net unrealized gains of $ 434 million, respectively, on marketable and non-marketable equity securities still held as of quarter end. For the nine months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized net unrealized losses of $ 262 million and net unrealized gains of $ 610 million, respectively, on marketable and non-marketable equity securities still held as of quarter end. Non-financial assets and liabilities. Certain non-financial assets such as goodwill, intangible assets and property, equipment and technology are only recognized at fair value if they are deemed to be impaired. The Company performed its annual impairment review of its indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill as of February 1, 2022, and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. As of June 30, 2022, there were no impairment indicators. Other Fair Value Disclosures Debt. Debt instruments are measured at amortized cost on the Company’s unaudited consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the debt instruments, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. As of June 30, 2022, the carrying value and estimated fair value of debt was $ 23.8 billion and $ 22.5 billion, respectively. As of September 30, 2021, the carrying value and estimated fair value of debt was $ 21.0 billion and $ 22.5 billion, respectively. Other financial instruments not measured at fair value. At June 30, 2022, the carrying values of settlement receivable and payable and customer collateral approximate fair value due to their generally short maturities. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 18 Table of Contents VISA INC.

Senior Notes In June 2022, the Company issued Euro-denominated fixed-rate senior notes in a public offering in an aggregate principal amount of € 3.0 billion ($ 3.2 billion), with maturities ranging between 4 and 12 years. The June 2026 Notes, 2029 Notes and 2034 Notes, or collectively, the ""Euro Notes"", have interest rates of 1.50 %, 2.00 % and 2.375 %, respectively. Interest on the Euro Notes is payable annually on June 15 of each year, commencing June 15, 2023. The net aggregate proceeds, after deducting discounts and debt issuance costs, were approximately € 3.0 billion ($ 3.2 billion). The Company plans to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include, among other things, the refinancing of existing indebtedness. The Company’s outstanding senior notes, or collectively, the “Notes”, are senior unsecured obligations of the Company, ranking equally and ratably among themselves and with the Company’s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt. The Notes are not secured by any assets of the Company and are not guaranteed by any of the Company’s subsidiaries. As of June 30, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all related covenants. Each series of Notes may be redeemed as a whole or in part at the Company’s option at any time at specified 19 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) redemption prices. In addition, each series of the Euro Notes may be redeemed as a whole at specified redemption prices upon the occurrence of certain U.S. tax events. Non-derivative Financial Instrument Designated as a Net Investment Hedge The Company designated € 1.2 billion of the € 3.0 billion Euro Notes, a non-derivative financial instrument, as a hedge against a portion of the Company’s Euro-denominated net investment in Visa Europe. Changes in the value of the designated portion of the Euro Notes, attributable to the change in exchange rates at the end of each reporting period, partially offset the foreign currency translation adjustments resulting from the Euro-denominated net investment, are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. Commercial Paper Program Visa maintains a commercial paper program to support its working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. Under the program, the Company is authorized to issue up to $ 3.0 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. During the three months ended June 30, 2022, the Company repaid $ 300 million and $ 650 million of commercial paper that was issued in March 2022 and April 2022, respectively. The Company had no outstanding obligations under the program as of June 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021. Note 8—Settlement Guarantee Management The Company indemnifies its clients for settlement losses suffered due to failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa operating rules. This indemnification creates settlement risk for the Company due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. Historically, the Company has experienced minimal losses as a result of its settlement risk guarantee. However, the Company’s future obligations, which could be material under its guarantees, are not determinable as they are dependent upon future events. The Company’s settlement exposure is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time, which vary significantly day to day. During the nine months ended June 30, 2022, the Company’s maximum daily settlement exposure was $ 116.3 billion and the average daily settlement exposure was $ 71.8 billion. The Company maintains and regularly reviews global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement exposure, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. The Company held the following collateral to manage settlement exposure: June 30, 2022 September 30, 2021 (in millions) Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents $ 2,261 $ 2,260 Pledged securities at market value 300 254 Letters of credit 1,622 1,518 Guarantees 706 758 Total $ 4,889 $ 4,790 20 Table of Contents VISA INC.

Series A preferred stock issuance. On July 29, 2022, the Company will issue approximately 176,853 shares of series A preferred stock in connection with the Sixth Anniversary Release. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . Reduction in as-converted shares. Under the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, when the Company funds the U.S. litigation escrow account, the value of the Company’s class B common stock is subject to dilution through a downward adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through periodic adjustments to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the series B and C preferred stock. The deposit and recovery have the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Company’s class A common stock, because it reduces the class B common stock and the series B and C preferred stock conversion rates and consequently, reduces the as-converted class A common stock share count. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . The following table presents the reduction in the number of as-converted class B common stock after deposit into the U.S. litigation escrow account for the nine months ended June 30, 2022.

In December 2021, the Company’s board of directors authorized a $ 12.0 billion share repurchase program (the “December 2021 Program”). Previously, in January 2021, the Company’s board of directors authorized an $ 8.0 billion share repurchase program. These authorizations have no expiration date. As of June 30, 2022, the Company’s repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $ 7.3 billion. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to the December 2021 Program have been completed. Dividends. The Company declared and paid dividends of $ 798 million and $ 698 million during the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 2.4 billion and $ 2.1 billion during the nine months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

Note 10—Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to each class of shares by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding and participating securities during the period. Participating securities include the Company’s series A, B and C preferred stock and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents. Net income is allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities based on its proportional ownership on an as-converted basis. The weighted-average number of shares outstanding of each class of common stock reflects changes in ownership over the periods presented. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity . 22 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding, participating securities and, if dilutive, potential class A common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive class A common stock equivalents may consist of: (1) shares of class A common stock issuable upon the conversion of series A, B and C preferred stock and class B and C common stock based on the conversion rates in effect through the period, and (2) incremental shares of class A common stock calculated by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of employee stock options, the assumed purchase of stock under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the assumed vesting of unearned performance shares.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) Related to the EIP, the Company recorded share-based compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, of $ 145 million and $ 153 million for the three months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 447 million and $ 417 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Note 12—Income Taxes For the three and nine months ended June 30, 2022, the effective income tax rates were 11 % and 17 %, respectively, and for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2021, the effective income tax rates were 41 % and 26 %, respectively. The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2022 differ from the effective tax rates for the same periods in the prior year primarily due to the following: • during the three months ended June 30, 2022, a decrease in the state apportionment rate, including a $ 176 million tax benefit related to prior years, as a result of a tax position taken related to a recent ruling; • during the three months ended June 30, 2021, a $ 1.0 billion non-recurring, non-cash tax expense related to the remeasurement of UK deferred tax liabilities; • during the three months ended June 30, 2021, a $ 51 million tax benefit as a result of a tax position taken on certain expenses; and • during the nine months ended June 30, 2021, $ 147 million of tax benefits as a result of the conclusion of audits by taxing authorities. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2022, the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits decreased by $ 34 million and increased by $ 109 million, respectively. The Company’s net unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably impact the effective tax rate, decreased by $ 75 million and $ 29 million, respectively. The change in unrecognized tax benefits is primarily related to the change in state apportionment mentioned above, partially offset by an increase in gross timing differences as well as various tax positions across several jurisdictions. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2022, the Company’s accrued penalties related to uncertain tax positions decreased by $ 31 million. The Company’s tax filings are subject to examination by U.S. federal, state and foreign taxing authorities. The timing and outcome of the final resolutions of the various ongoing income tax examinations are highly uncertain. It is not reasonably possible to estimate the increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. Note 13—Legal Matters The Company is party to various legal and regulatory proceedings. Some of these proceedings involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. Accordingly, except as disclosed, the Company has not established reserves or ranges of possible loss related to these proceedings, as at this time in the proceedings, the matters do not relate to a probable loss and/or the amount or range of losses are not reasonably estimable. Although the Company believes that it has strong defenses for the litigation and regulatory proceedings described below, it could, in the future, incur judgments or fines or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. From time to time, the Company may engage in settlement discussions or mediations with respect to one or more of its outstanding litigation matters, either on its own behalf or collectively with other parties. The litigation accrual is an estimate and is based on management’s understanding of its litigation profile, the specifics of each case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management’s best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date. 25 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) The following table summarizes the activity related to accrued litigation: Nine Months Ended June 30, 2022 2021 (in millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 983 $ 914 Provision for uncovered legal matters 2 5 Provision for covered legal matters 878 23 Payments for legal matters ( 377 ) ( 42 ) Balance at end of period $ 1,486 $ 900 Accrual Summary—U.S. Covered Litigation Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A. and Visa International are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, which the Company refers to as the U.S. covered litigation. An accrual for the U.S. covered litigation and a charge to the litigation provision are recorded when a loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. In making this determination, the Company evaluates available information, including but not limited to actions taken by the Company’s litigation committee. The total accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the escrow account balance. See further discussion below under U.S. Covered Litigation and Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans. The following table summarizes the accrual activity related to U.S. covered litigation: Nine Months Ended June 30, 2022 2021 (in millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 881 $ 888 Provision for interchange multidistrict litigation 861 — Payments for U.S. covered litigation ( 262 ) ( 7 ) Balance at end of period $ 1,480 $ 881 During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2022, the Company recorded additional accruals of $ 716 million and $ 861 million, respectively, and deposited $ 600 million and $ 850 million, respectively, into the U.S. litigation escrow account to address claims of certain merchants who opted out of the Amended Settlement Agreement. The U.S. covered litigation accrual balance is consistent with the Company’s estimate of its share of the lower end of a probable and reasonably estimable loss with respect to U.S. covered litigation. While this estimate is consistent with the Company’s view of the current status of the litigation, the probable and reasonably estimable loss or range of such loss could materially vary based on developments in the litigation. The Company will continue to consider and reevaluate this estimate in light of the substantial uncertainties with respect to the litigation. The Company is unable to estimate a potential loss or range of loss, if any, at trial if negotiated resolutions cannot be reached. Accrual Summary—VE Territory Covered Litigation Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the Europe retrospective responsibility plan. Unlike the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Europe retrospective responsibility plan does not have an escrow account that is used to fund settlements or judgments. The Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through periodic adjustments to the conversion rates applicable to the series B and C preferred stock. An accrual for the VE territory covered losses and a reduction to stockholders’ equity will be recorded when the loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. See further discussion below under VE Territory Covered Litigation and Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . 26 Table of Contents VISA INC.

Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) - Individual Merchant Actions Visa has reached settlements with a number of merchants representing approximately 55 % of the Visa-branded payment card sales volume of merchants who opted out of the Amended Settlement Agreement with the Damages Class plaintiffs. VE Territory Covered Litigation Europe Merchant Litigation Since July 2013, in excess of 850 Merchants (the capitalized term “Merchant,” when used in this section, means a merchant together with subsidiary/affiliate companies that are party to the same claim) have commenced proceedings against Visa Europe, Visa Inc. and other Visa subsidiaries in the UK, Belgium, Poland and Israel primarily relating to interchange rates in Europe and in some cases relating to fees charged by Visa and certain Visa rules. As of the filing date, Visa has settled the claims asserted by over 150 Merchants, leaving more than 650 Merchants with outstanding claims. In addition, over 30 additional Merchants have threatened to commence similar proceedings. Standstill agreements have been entered into with respect to some of those threatened Merchant claims, several of which have been settled. On November 26, 2021, with respect to certain pending Merchant claims, the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) found that UK and certain other domestic and intra-European Economic Area consumer interchange fees before the introduction of the Interchange Fee Regulation (IFR) were a restriction of competition, but that the question of whether those fees, along with inter-European Economic Area fees, are a restriction of competition after the introduction of the IFR would need to be resolved at trial. Whether any interchange fees are exempt from the finding of restriction under applicable law and the assessment of damages, if any, will also need to be considered at trial. On February 1, 2022, the UK Court of Appeal granted claimants permission to appeal the CAT’s ruling and an appeal hearing is scheduled for July 2022. On June 1, 2022, two class action claims were filed against Visa with the CAT on behalf of UK businesses that accepted Visa-branded payment cards at any time from June 1, 2016 alleging that UK domestic, intra-European Economic Area, and inter-regional interchange fees on commercial credit cards, and inter-regional interchange fees on consumer cards, are anti-competitive. The Europe retrospective responsibility plan covers liabilities and losses relating to the covered period, which generally refers to the period before the closing of the Visa Europe acquisition. Other Litigation On July 3, 2022, Visa filed a motion challenging jurisdiction in the action filed against Visa and MasterCard in the Israel Central District Court. 27 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) Other Litigation Pulse Network On April 5, 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, in part, the district court’s summary judgment decision in Visa's favor, finding that Pulse has standing to pursue certain of its claims, and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings. German ATM Litigation Between December 2021 and June 2022, Visa was served with claims in Germany brought by German savings banks against Visa Europe and Visa Inc. The banks claim that Visa’s ATM rules prohibiting the charging of access fees on domestic cash withdrawals are anti-competitive and they are seeking damages. Visa has filed challenges to the jurisdiction of the German courts to hear these claims. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Litigation On December 6, 2021, an amended complaint making similar allegations regarding the setting of foreign exchange rates was filed by several individuals on behalf of a nationwide class, and/or California, Washington, Massachusetts or New Jersey subclasses, of cardholders who made a transaction in a foreign currency. The amended complaint asserts claims for unjust enrichment and restitution as well as violations of the California Unfair Competition Law, the Washington Consumer Protection Act, the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act, and the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act. On January 19, 2022, Visa filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This management’s discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition and the liquidity and capital resources of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Visa,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company”) on a historical basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings, as well as those factors that may affect future earnings. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 1—Financial Statements of this report. Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that relate to, among other things, the impact on our future financial position, results of operations and cash flows as a result of the invasion of Ukraine by Russia; the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the reopening of borders and resumption of international travel; prospects, developments, strategies and growth of our business; anticipated expansion of our products in certain countries; industry developments; anticipated timing and benefits of our acquisitions; expectations regarding litigation matters, investigations and proceedings; timing and amount of stock repurchases; sufficiency of sources of liquidity and funding; effectiveness of our risk management programs; and expectations regarding the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements.

A summary of our as-reported U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP operating results is as follows: Three Months Ended June 30, Nine Months Ended June 30, 2022 2021 % Change (1) 2022 2021 % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages and per share data) Net revenues $ 7,275 $ 6,130 19 % $ 21,523 $ 17,546 23 % Operating expenses $ 3,127 $ 2,066 51 % $ 7,797 $ 6,057 29 % Net income $ 3,411 $ 2,575 32 % $ 11,017 $ 8,727 26 % Diluted earnings per share $ 1.60 $ 1.18 36 % $ 5.14 $ 3.98 29 % Non-GAAP operating expenses (2) $ 2,353 $ 2,048 15 % $ 6,755 $ 5,854 15 % Non-GAAP net income (2) $ 4,206 $ 3,256 29 % $ 11,943 $ 9,412 27 % Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (2) $ 1.98 $ 1.49 33 % $ 5.57 $ 4.29 30 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. (2) For a full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results, see tables in Non-GAAP financial results below. Russia & Ukraine. During the quarter ended March 31, 2022, economic sanctions were imposed on Russia by the U.S., European Union, United Kingdom and other jurisdictions and authorities, impacting Visa and its clients. We announced in March 2022 that we were suspending our operations in Russia. As a result, we are no longer generating revenue from domestic and cross-border activities related to Russia. Since 2015, domestic transactions have been processed by Russia’s state-owned payments operator, National Payment Card System. With respect to cross-border activities, all transactions initiated with Visa cards issued by financial institutions outside Russia no longer work within Russia, and all transactions on cards issued in Russia no longer work outside the country. Furthermore, during the quarter ended March 31, 2022 we deconsolidated our Russian subsidiary, as required under U.S. GAAP. For the nine months ended June 30, 2022 and full year fiscal 2021, total net revenues from Russia, including revenues driven by domestic as well as cross-border activities, were approximately 3% and 4% of our consolidated net revenues, respectively. With respect to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, our priority is ensuring the safety and security of our colleagues and their families who are directly impacted. We are in close contact with those in the region and are providing ongoing support to our colleagues. COVID-19. As the effects of the evolving COVID-19 pandemic continue, our priority remains the safety of our employees, clients and the communities in which we live and operate. We are taking a phased approach to reopening our offices, with the return to office of our U.S. employees in April 2022 in a new hybrid model of flexible work. The ongoing effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and COVID-19 are difficult to predict due to numerous uncertainties identified in Part II, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2022 . We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business. Highlights for the first nine months of fiscal 2022. For the three and nine months ended June 30, 2022, net revenues increased 19% and 23% over the prior-year comparable periods, primarily due to the growth in nominal cross-border volume, nominal payments volume and processed transactions, partially offset by higher client incentives. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2022, exchange rate movements and our hedging 30 Table of Contents program negatively impacted our net revenues growth by approximately three percentage points and two percentage points, respectively. For the three months ended June 30, 2022, GAAP operating expenses increased 51% over the prior-year comparable period primarily due to higher expenses for litigation provision and personnel. For the nine months ended June 30, 2022, GAAP operating expenses increased 29% over the prior-year comparable period primarily due to higher expenses related to litigation provision and personnel. See Results of Operations—Operating Expenses below for further discussion. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2022, exchange rate movements positively impacted our operating expense growth by approximately two percentage points. For the three months ended June 30, 2022, non-GAAP operating expenses increased 15% over the prior-year comparable period primarily due to higher expenses for personnel and general and administrative. For the nine months ended June 30, 2022, non-GAAP operating expenses increased 15% over the prior year comparable period primarily due to higher expenses related to personnel and marketing. Senior notes. In June 2022, we issued Euro-denominated fixed-rate senior notes in a public offering in an aggregate principal amount of €3.0 billion, with maturities ranging between 4 and 12 years. See Note 7—Debt to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Acquisitions. On December 20, 2021, we acquired The Currency Cloud Group Limited (“Currencycloud”), a UK-based global platform that enables banks and fintechs to provide innovative foreign exchange solutions for cross-border payments, for a total purchase consideration of $893 million (which includes the fair value of our previously held equity interest in Currencycloud). On March 10, 2022, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Tink AB (“Tink”) for $1.9 billion in cash. Tink is a European open banking platform that enables financial institutions, fintechs and merchants to build financial products and services and move money. See Note 2—Acquisitions to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Interchange multidistrict litigation. During the nine months ended June 30, 2022, we recorded additional accruals of $861 million to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. We also made deposits of $850 million into the U.S. litigation escrow account. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 13—Legal Matters to our unaudited consolidated financial statements . Common stock repurchases. In December 2021, our board of directors authorized a $12.0 billion share repurchase program . During the nine months ended June 30, 2022, we repurchased 46 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market for $9.5 billion. As of June 30, 2022, our repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $7.3 billion. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Non-GAAP financial results. We use non-GAAP financial measures of our performance which exclude certain items which we believe are not representative of our continuing operations, as they may be non-recurring or have no cash impact, and may distort our longer-term operating trends. We consider non-GAAP measures useful to investors because they provide greater transparency into management’s view and assessment of our ongoing operating performance. • Gains and losses on equity investments. Gains and losses on equity investments include periodic non-cash fair value adjustments and gains and losses upon sale of an investment. These long-term investments are strategic in nature and are primarily private company investments. Gains and losses and the related tax impacts associated with these investments are tied to the performance of the companies that we invest in and therefore do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business. • Amortization of acquired intangible assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, customer relationships and brands acquired in connection with business combinations executed beginning in fiscal 2019. Amortization charges for our acquired intangible assets are non-cash and are significantly affected by the timing, frequency and size of our acquisitions, rather than our core operations. As such, we have excluded this amount and the related tax impact to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance. 31 Table of Contents • Acquisition-related costs. Acquisition-related costs consist primarily of one-time transaction and integration costs associated with our business combinations. These costs include professional fees, technology integration fees, restructuring activities and other direct costs related to the purchase and integration of acquired entities. These costs also include retention equity and deferred equity compensation when they are agreed upon as part of the purchase price of the transaction but are required to be recognized as expense post-combination. We have excluded these amounts and the related tax impacts as the expenses are recognized for a limited duration and do not reflect the underlying performance of our business. • Litigation provision. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2022, we recorded additional accruals to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation of $716 million and $861 million, respectively, and related tax benefit of $159 million and $191 million, respectively, determined by applying applicable tax rates. Under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, we recover the monetary liabilities related to the U.S. covered litigation through a downward adjustment to the conversion rate of our class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 13—Legal Matters to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. • Russia-Ukraine charges. During the nine months ended June 30, 2022, we recorded a loss within general and administrative expense of $35 million from the deconsolidation of our Russian subsidiary. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. We also incurred charges of $25 million in personnel expense as a result of steps taken to support our employees in Russia and Ukraine. We have excluded these amounts and the related tax benefit of $4 million, determined by applying applicable tax rates, as they are one-time charges and do not reflect the underlying performance of our business. • Remeasurement of deferred tax balances. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2021, in connection with the UK enacted legislation on June 10, 2021 that will increase the tax rate from 19% to 25%, effective April 1, 2023, we remeasured our net deferred tax liabilities, resulting in the recognition of a non-recurring, non-cash income tax expense of $1.0 billion. • Indirect taxes . During the nine months ended June 30, 2021, we recognized a one-time charge within general and administrative expense of $152 million, and related tax benefit of $40 million determined by applying applicable tax rates. This charge is to record our estimate of probable additional indirect taxes, related to prior periods, for which we could be liable as a result of certain changes in applicable law. This one-time charge is not representative of our ongoing operations. Non-GAAP operating expenses, non-operating income (expense), income tax provision, effective income tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share should not be relied upon as substitutes for, or considered in isolation from, measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following tables reconcile our as-reported financial measures, calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to our respective non-GAAP financial measures: Three Months Ended June 30, 2022 Operating Expenses Non-operating Income (Expense) Income Tax Provision Effective Income Tax Rate (1) Net Income Diluted Earnings Per Share (1) (in millions, except percentages and per share data) As reported $ 3,127 $ (319) $ 418 10.9 % $ 3,411 $ 1.60 (Gains) losses on equity investments, net — 246 54 192 0.09 Amortization of acquired intangible assets (44) — 10 34 0.02 Acquisition-related costs (14) — 2 12 0.01 Litigation provision (716) — 159 557 0.26 Non-GAAP $ 2,353 $ (73) $ 643 13.3 % $ 4,206 $ 1.98 32 Table of Contents Nine Months Ended June 30, 2022 Operating Expenses Non-operating Income (Expense) Income Tax Provision Effective Income Tax Rate (1) Net Income Diluted Earnings Per Share (1) (in millions, except percentages and per share data) As reported $ 7,797 $ (458) $ 2,251 17.0 % $ 11,017 $ 5.14 (Gains) losses on equity investments, net — 142 40 102 0.05 Amortization of acquired intangible assets (77) — 17 60 0.03 Acquisition-related costs (44) — 6 38 0.02 Litigation provision (861) — 191 670 0.31 Russia-Ukraine charges (60) — 4 56 0.03 Non-GAAP $ 6,755 $ (316) $ 2,509 17.4 % $ 11,943 $ 5.57 Three Months Ended June 30, 2021 Operating Expenses Non-operating Income (Expense) Income Tax Provision Effective Income Tax Rate (1) Net Income Diluted Earnings Per Share (1) (in millions, except percentages and per share data) As reported $ 2,066 $ 325 $ 1,814 41.3 % $ 2,575 $ 1.18 (Gains) losses on equity investments, net — (439) (99) (340) (0.16) Amortization of acquired intangible assets (13) — 3 10 — Acquisition-related costs (5) — 1 4 — Remeasurement of deferred tax balances — — (1,007) 1,007 0.46 Non-GAAP $ 2,048 $ (114) $ 712 17.9 % $ 3,256 $ 1.49 Nine Months Ended June 30, 2021 Operating Expenses Non-operating Income (Expense) Income Tax Provision Effective Income Tax Rate (1) Net Income Diluted Earnings Per Share (1) (in millions, except percentages and per share data) As reported $ 6,057 $ 276 $ 3,038 25.8 % $ 8,727 $ 3.98 (Gains) losses on equity investments, net — (611) (138) (473) (0.22) Amortization of acquired intangible assets (38) — 9 29 0.01 Acquisition-related costs (13) — 3 10 — Remeasurement of deferred tax balances — — (1,007) 1,007 0.46 Indirect taxes (152) — 40 112 0.05 Non-GAAP $ 5,854 $ (335) $ 1,945 17.1 % $ 9,412 $ 4.29 (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Effective income tax rate, diluted earnings per share and their respective totals are calculated based on unrounded numbers. Payments volume and processed transactions. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues. 33 Table of Contents Payments volume represents the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, V PAY and Interlink brands and excludes Europe co-badged volume. Nominal payments volume is denominated in U.S. dollars and is calculated each quarter by applying an established U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rate for each local currency in which our volumes are reported. Processed transactions represent transactions using cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, V PAY, Interlink and PLUS brands processed on Visa’s networks.

Therefore, service revenues reported for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, were based on nominal payments volume reported by our financial institution clients for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. On occasion, previously presented volume information may be updated. Prior-period updates are not material. (2) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes and totals are calculated based on unrounded numbers. (3) Includes consumer prepaid volume and Interlink volume. (4) Includes large, medium and small business credit and debit, as well as commercial prepaid volume. (5) Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks.

Results of Operations Net Revenues The following table presents our net revenues earned in the U.S. and internationally: Three Months Ended June 30, Nine Months Ended June 30, 2022 2021 % Change (1) 2022 2021 % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) U.S. $ 3,170 $ 2,806 13 % $ 9,427 $ 8,156 16 % International 4,105 3,324 23 % 12,096 9,390 29 % Net revenues $ 7,275 $ 6,130 19 % $ 21,523 $ 17,546 23 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. Net revenues increased during the three and nine-month comparable periods primarily due to the growth in nominal cross-border volume, nominal payments volume and processed transactions, partially offset by higher client incentives. 35 Table of Contents Our net revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2022, exchange rate movements and our hedging program negatively impacted our net revenues growth by approximately three percentage points and two percentage points, respectively. The following table presents the components of our net revenues: Three Months Ended June 30, Nine Months Ended June 30, 2022 2021 % Change (1) 2022 2021 % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Service revenues $ 3,189 $ 2,828 13 % $ 9,903 $ 8,350 19 % Data processing revenues 3,579 3,327 8 % 10,673 9,356 14 % International transaction revenues 2,560 1,696 51 % 6,942 4,635 50 % Other revenues 517 409 26 % 1,440 1,185 21 % Client incentives (2,570) (2,130) 21 % (7,435) (5,980) 24 % Net revenues $ 7,275 $ 6,130 19 % $ 21,523 $ 17,546 23 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. • Service revenues increased primarily due to 14% and 18% growth in nominal payments volume during the three and nine-month comparable periods, respectively. For the three-month comparable period, service revenues were partially offset by our suspension of operations in Russia as we recognized revenues from fiscal third quarter, based on fiscal second quarter payments volume, in fiscal second quarter. • Data processing revenues increased primarily due to overall growth in processed transactions of 16% and 19% during the three and nine-month comparable periods, respectively, partially offset by our suspension of operations in Russia and unfavorable currency fluctuations. • International transaction revenues increased primarily due to growth in nominal cross-border volumes, excluding transactions within Europe, of 38% and 42% during the three and nine-month comparable periods, respectively. International transaction revenues also increased due to volatility of a broad range of currencies and select pricing modifications. • Other revenues increased primarily due to value added services revenues tied to marketing services, travel related card benefits, consulting revenues, other value added services and select pricing modifications. • Client incentives increased primarily due to growth in payments volume during the three and nine-month comparable periods. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or execution of new contracts. 36 Table of Contents Operating Expenses The following table presents the components of our total operating expenses: Three Months Ended June 30, Nine Months Ended June 30, 2022 2021 % Change (1) 2022 2021 % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Personnel $ 1,283 $ 1,098 17 % $ 3,634 $ 3,193 14 % Marketing 313 268 17 % 907 679 34 % Network and processing 178 186 (4 %) 558 538 4 % Professional fees 117 108 9 % 342 273 25 % Depreciation and amortization 230 204 13 % 635 602 6 % General and administrative 289 204 41 % 856 770 11 % Litigation provision 717 (2) NM 865 2 NM Total operating expenses $ 3,127 $ 2,066 51 % $ 7,797 $ 6,057 29 % NM - Not meaningful (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. Total operating expenses increased during the three months ended June 30, 2022 primarily due to a provision for U.S. covered litigation, partially offset by a decrease in expenses due to the suspension of our operations in Russia. In the nine months ended June 30, 2022, expenses increased as we lapped planned delays in spending in the first half of fiscal 2021 and invested in future growth and due to the provision for U.S. covered litigation. • Personnel expenses increased during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2022 primarily due to higher headcount and compensation, reflecting our strategy to invest in future growth, including acquisitions. The increase during the nine months ended June 30, 2022 also included expenses incurred as a result of steps taken to support our employees in Russia and Ukraine. • Marketing expenses increased during the three months ended June 30, 2022 primarily in support of a number of campaigns and client marketing. In the nine months ended June 30, 2022, expenses increased as we lapped planned delays in spending in the first half of fiscal 2021 and increased spending in various campaigns, including the Beijing 2022 Olympics Winter Games, and client marketing. • Professional fees increased during the three months ended June 30, 2022, reflecting higher investment in various corporate projects. In the nine months ended June 30, 2022, expenses increased as we lapped planned delays in spending in the first half of fiscal 2021. • Depreciation and amortization expenses increased during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2022 primarily due to additional depreciation and amortization from our acquisitions and on-going investments. • General and administrative expenses increased during the three months ended June 30, 2022 primarily due to higher travel expenses, higher usage of travel related card benefits and the inclusion of expenses from our acquisitions. In the nine months ended June 30, 2022, expenses increased primarily due to the suspension of our operations in Russia and deconsolidation of our Russian subsidiary, higher usage of travel related card benefits, higher travel expenses and the inclusion of expenses from our acquisitions, partially offset by one-time charge of indirect taxes in the prior year. • Litigation provision increased during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2022 primarily due to additional accruals of $716 million and $861 million, respectively, related to the U.S. covered litigation. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 13—Legal Matters to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. 37 Table of Contents Non-operating Income (Expense) The following table presents the components of our non-operating income (expense): Three Months Ended June 30, Nine Months Ended June 30, 2022 2021 % Change (1) 2022 2021 % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Interest expense, net $ (111) $ (131) (15 %) $ (379) $ (388) (2 %) Investment income and other (208) 456 (146 %) (79) 664 (112 %) Total non-operating income (expense) $ (319) $ 325 (198 %) $ (458) $ 276 (266 %) (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. • Interest expense, net decreased in the three months ended June 30, 2022 primarily due to lower interest expense related to income taxes, partially offset by higher interest expense as a result of the issuance of debt in the three months ended June 30, 2022. The decrease in the nine months ended June 30, 2022 was primarily driven by lower interest expense due to the timing of debt issuance. • Investment income and other decreased in the three and nine months ended June 30, 2022 primarily due to losses on our equity investments. Effective Income Tax Rate The following table presents our effective income tax rates: Three Months Ended June 30, Nine Months Ended June 30, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Effective income tax rate 11 % 41 % 17 % 26 % The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2022 differ from the effective tax rates for the same periods in the prior year primarily due to the following: • during the three months ended June 30, 2022, a decrease in the state apportionment rate, including a $176 million tax benefit related to prior years, as a result of a tax position taken related to a recent ruling; • during the three months ended June 30, 2021, a $1.0 billion non-recurring, non-cash tax expense related to the remeasurement of UK deferred tax liabilities; • during the three months ended June 30, 2021, a $51 million tax benefit as a result of a tax position taken on certain expenses; and • during the nine months ended June 30, 2021, $147 million of tax benefits as a result of the conclusion of audits by taxing authorities. 38 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Data The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the periods presented: Nine Months Ended June 30, 2022 2021 (in millions) Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 12,973 $ 11,256 Investing activities (4,395) 1,546 Financing activities (8,656) (10,791) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents (725) 92 Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents $ (803) $ 2,103 Operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended June 30, 2022 was higher than the prior-year comparable period primarily due to growth in our underlying business, partially offset by higher client incentive payments. Investing activities. Cash was used in investing activities for the nine months ended June 30, 2022 as compared to cash provided by investing activities during the prior-year comparable period primarily due to lower proceeds from sales and maturities of investment securities, combined with higher purchases of investment securities, and higher cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash and restricted cash acquired. See Note 2—Acquisitions and Note 4—Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended June 30, 2022 was lower than the prior-year comparable period primarily due to proceeds received from the issuance of senior notes in the current year and the absence of the principal debt payment made in the prior year, partially offset by higher share repurchases and higher dividends paid. See Note 7—Debt and Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements . Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings and the returns that these holdings provide. Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our current and projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances. Commercial paper program . We maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. During the three months ended June 30, 2022, we repaid $300 million and $650 million of commercial paper that was issued in March 2022 and April 2022, respectively. We had no outstanding obligations under the program as of June 30, 2022. Senior notes. In June 2022, we issued Euro-denominated fixed-rate senior notes in a public offering in an aggregate principal amount of €3.0 billion ($3.2 billion), with maturities ranging between 4 and 12 years. See Note 7—Debt to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. 39 Table of Contents Uses of Liquidity There has been no significant change to our primary uses of liquidity since September 30, 2021, except as discussed below. Common stock repurchases. During the nine months ended June 30, 2022, we repurchased shares of our class A common stock in the open market for $9.5 billion. As of June 30, 2022, our repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $7.3 billion. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Dividends . During the nine months ended June 30, 2022, we declared and paid $2.4 billion in dividends to holders of our common and preferred stock. On July 22, 2022, our board of directors declared a cash dividend in the amount of $0.375 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and series A, B and C convertible participating preferred stock on an as-converted basis). See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. All preferred and class B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends. Senior notes . Principal payments on our fixed-rate senior notes of $1.0 billion and $2.3 billion are due in September 2022 and December 2022, respectively, for which we have sufficient liquidity. See Note 7—Debt to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Litigation. During the nine months ended June 30, 2022, we deposited $850 million into the U.S. litigation escrow account to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. The balance of this account as of June 30, 2022 was $1.5 billion and is reflected as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 13—Legal Matters to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Acquisitions . On December 20, 2021, we acquired Currencycloud for a total purchase consideration of $893 million (which includes the fair value of our previously held equity interest in Currencycloud), and on March 10, 2022, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Tink for $1.9 billion in cash. See Note 2—Acquisitions to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-04, which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. Subsequently, the FASB also issued an amendment to this standard. The amendments in the ASU are effective upon issuance through December 31, 2022. We are evaluating the effect ASU 2020-04 and its subsequent amendment will have on our consolidated financial statements. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. ITEM 3.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Organization. Visa Inc. (“Visa” or the “Company”) is a global payments technology company that facilitates global commerce and money movement across more than 200 countries and territories. Visa and its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries operate one of the world’s largest electronic payments network — VisaNet — which provides transaction processing services (primarily authorization, clearing and settlement). The Company offers products and solutions that facilitate secure, reliable and efficient money movement for all participants in the ecosystem. Visa is not a financial institution and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders of Visa products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, Visa’s financial institution clients. Consolidation and basis of presentation. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The Company consolidates its majority-owned and controlled entities, including variable interest entities (“VIEs”) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company’s investments in VIEs have not been material to its unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. During the quarter ended March 31, 2022, economic sanctions were imposed on Russia, impacting Visa and its clients. The extent and severity of the sanctions impacted the Company’s operations and a reduction in Ruble liquidity impacted the Company’s ability to manage operational impact and related foreign currency risk. In March 2022, the Company announced it was suspending its operations in Russia. In addition, the Company deconsolidated its Russian subsidiary, resulting in a pre-tax loss of $ 35 million, which is included in general and administrative expense on the consolidated statements of operations. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) requirements for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and, consequently, do not include all of the annual disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. Reference should be made to the Visa Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2021 for additional disclosures, including a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. Use of estimates. The preparation of the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained, and will be recognized in the period in which such changes occur. Future actual results could differ materially from these estimates. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2019-12, which simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in the existing guidance and making other minor improvements. The Company adopted this guidance effective October 1, 2021. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01, which clarifies that an entity should consider observable transactions that require it to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting for purposes of applying 12 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) the fair value measurement alternative. The Company adopted this guidance effective October 1, 2021. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Note 2—Acquisitions Currencycloud On December 20, 2021, Visa acquired The Currency Cloud Group Limited (“Currencycloud”), a UK-based global platform that enables banks and fintechs to provide innovative foreign exchange solutions for cross-border payments, for a total purchase consideration of $ 893 million (which includes the fair value of Visa’s previously held equity interest in Currencycloud). The Company allocated $ 150 million of the purchase consideration to technology, intangible assets, other net assets acquired and deferred tax liabilities and the remaining $ 743 million to goodwill. Tink On March 10, 2022, Visa acquired 100 % of the share capital of Tink AB (“Tink”) for $ 1.9 billion in cash. Tink is a European open banking platform that enables financial institutions, fintechs and merchants to build financial products and services and move money. The acquisition is expected to help accelerate the adoption of open banking around the world by providing a secure, reliable platform for innovation. Total purchase consideration has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and is subject to revision. If additional information becomes available, the Company may further revise the purchase price allocation as soon as practicable, but no later than one year from the acquisition date; however, at this time, material changes are not expected. The following table summarizes the purchase price allocation for Tink: Purchase Price Allocation Weighted-Average Useful Life (in millions) (in years) Technology $ 245 4 Customer relationships 90 6 Deferred tax liabilities ( 71 ) Other net assets acquired (liabilities assumed) 22 Goodwill 1,577 Total $ 1,863 5 Goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to be achieved from the acquisition and the assembled workforce. None of the goodwill recognized is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The Company did not include Tink's financial results in the Company's consolidated statements of operations from the acquisition date, March 10, 2022, through March 31, 2022, as the impact is not material to the Company’s financial results. 13 Table of Contents VISA INC.

These amounts are fully offset by corresponding liabilities recorded in accrued liabilities on the Company’s unaudited consolidated balance sheets. Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan Under the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Company maintains an escrow account from which settlements of, or judgments in, certain litigation referred to as the “U.S. covered litigation” are paid. The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the U.S. litigation escrow account balance. See Note 13—Legal Matters . 14 Table of Contents VISA INC.

See Note 13—Legal Matters . Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plan Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rates in the Visa Europe territory (the “VE territory covered litigation”). Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover certain losses resulting from VE territory covered litigation (the “VE territory covered losses”) through a periodic adjustment to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the series B and C preferred stock. VE territory covered losses are recorded in “right to recover for covered losses” within stockholders’ equity before the corresponding adjustment to the applicable conversion rate is effected. Adjustments to the conversion rate may be executed once in any six-month period unless a single, individual loss greater than € 20 million is incurred, in which case, the six-month limitation does not apply. When the adjustment to the conversion rate is made, the amount previously recorded in “right to recover for covered losses” as contra-equity is then recorded against the book value of the preferred stock within stockholders’ equity. The following table presents the activities related to VE territory covered losses in preferred stock and “right to recover for covered losses” within stockholders’ equity: Preferred Stock Right to Recover for Covered Losses Series B Series C (in millions) Balance as of September 30, 2021 $ 1,071 $ 1,523 $ ( 133 ) VE territory covered losses incurred (1) — — ( 16 ) Recovery through conversion rate adjustment ( 26 ) ( 3 ) 29 Balance as of March 31, 2022 $ 1,045 $ 1,520 $ ( 120 ) Preferred Stock Right to Recover for Covered Losses Series B Series C (in millions) Balance as of September 30, 2020 $ 1,106 $ 1,543 $ ( 39 ) VE territory covered losses incurred (1) — — ( 17 ) Recovery through conversion rate adjustment ( 9 ) ( 6 ) 15 Balance as of March 31, 2021 $ 1,097 $ 1,537 $ ( 41 ) (1) VE territory covered losses incurred reflect settlements with merchants and additional legal costs.

Money market funds, marketable equity securities and U.S. Treasury securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. The Company’s deferred compensation liability is measured at fair value based on marketable equity securities held under the deferred compensation plan. Level 2 assets and liabilities. The fair value of U.S. government-sponsored debt securities, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. Derivative instruments are valued using inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and U.S. Treasury securities. As of March 31, 2022 and September 30, 2021, gross unrealized gains and losses were not material. As of March 31, 2022, $ 1.5 billion of the Company’s debt securities are due within one year and $ 2.3 billion is due between one to five years. 17 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis Non-marketable equity securities. The Company’s non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. These investments are classified as Level 3 due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and the fact that inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require management’s judgment. The following table summarizes the total carrying value of the Company’s non-marketable equity securities held as of March 31, 2022 including cumulative unrealized gains and losses: March 31, 2022 (in millions) Initial cost basis $ 908 Adjustments: Upward adjustments 806 Downward adjustments (including impairment) ( 66 ) Carrying amount, end of period $ 1,648 Unrealized gains and losses included in the carrying value of the Company’s non-marketable equity securities still held as of March 31, 2022 and 2021 were as follows: Three Months Ended March 31, Six Months Ended March 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 (in millions) Upward adjustments $ 2 $ 129 $ 226 $ 143 Downward adjustments (including impairment) $ ( 53 ) $ — $ ( 53 ) $ ( 2 ) For the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized net unrealized losses of $ 156 million, and net unrealized gains of $ 147 million, respectively, on marketable and non-marketable equity securities still held as of quarter end. For the six months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized net unrealized gains of $ 16 million and $ 176 million, respectively, on marketable and non-marketable equity securities still held as of quarter end. Non-financial assets and liabilities. Certain non-financial assets such as goodwill, intangible assets and property, equipment and technology are only recognized at fair value if they are deemed to be impaired. The Company performed its annual impairment review of its indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill as of February 1, 2022, and concluded there was no impairment as of that date. As of March 31, 2022, there were no impairment indicators. Other Fair Value Disclosures Debt. Debt instruments are measured at amortized cost on the Company’s unaudited consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the debt instruments, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. As of March 31, 2022, the carrying value and estimated fair value of debt was $ 20.7 billion and $ 20.8 billion, respectively. As of September 30, 2021, the carrying value and estimated fair value of debt was $ 21.0 billion and $ 22.5 billion, respectively. Other financial instruments not measured at fair value. At March 31, 2022, the carrying value of settlement receivable and payable, commercial paper and customer collateral approximates fair value due to their generally short maturities. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 18 Table of Contents VISA INC.

Commercial Paper Program Visa maintains a commercial paper program to support its working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. Under the program, the Company is authorized to issue up to $ 3.0 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. The commercial paper outstanding as of March 31, 2022 was fully repaid in April 2022. Subsequent to March 31, 2022, the Company issued $ 650 million of commercial paper that was also fully repaid in April 2022. Note 8—Settlement Guarantee Management The Company indemnifies its clients for settlement losses suffered due to failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa operating rules. This indemnification creates settlement risk for the Company due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. Historically, the Company has experienced minimal losses as a result of its settlement risk guarantee. However, the Company’s future obligations, which could be material under its guarantees, are not determinable as they are dependent upon future events. 19 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) The Company’s settlement exposure is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time, which vary significantly day to day. During the six months ended March 31, 2022, the Company’s maximum daily settlement exposure was $ 112.7 billion and the average daily settlement exposure was $ 71.3 billion. The Company maintains and regularly reviews global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement exposure, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. The Company held the following collateral to manage settlement exposure: March 31, 2022 September 30, 2021 (in millions) Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents $ 2,309 $ 2,260 Pledged securities at market value 270 254 Letters of credit 1,604 1,518 Guarantees 793 758 Total $ 4,976 $ 4,790 Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity As-converted class A common stock.

(4) The class B to class A common stock conversion rate is presented on a rounded basis. Conversion calculations for dividend payments are based on a conversion rate rounded to the tenth decimal. Reduction in as-converted shares. Under the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, when the Company funds the U.S. litigation escrow account, the value of the Company’s class B common stock is subject to dilution through a downward adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through periodic adjustments to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the series B and C preferred stock. The deposit and recovery have the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Company’s class A common stock, because it reduces the class B common stock and the series B and C preferred stock conversion rates and consequently, reduces the as-converted class A common stock share count. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . 20 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) The following table presents the reduction in the number of as-converted class B common stock after deposit into the U.S. litigation escrow account for the six months ended March 31, 2022.

Average repurchase price per share and total cost are calculated based on unrounded numbers. In December 2021, the Company’s board of directors authorized a $ 12.0 billion share repurchase program (the “December 2021 Program”). Previously, in January 2021, the Company’s board of directors authorized an $ 8.0 billion share repurchase program. These authorizations have no expiration date. As of March 31, 2022, the Company’s repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $ 9.8 billion. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to the December 2021 Program have been completed. 21 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) Dividends. The Company declared and paid dividends of $ 802 million and $ 701 million during the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and $ 1.6 billion and $ 1.4 billion during the six months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. On April 22, 2022, the Company’s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $ 0.375 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and series A, B and C preferred stock on an as-converted basis), which will be paid on June 1, 2022, to all holders of record as of May 13, 2022. Note 10—Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to each class of shares by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding and participating securities during the period. Participating securities include the Company’s series A, B and C preferred stock and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents. Net income is allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities based on its proportional ownership on an as-converted basis. The weighted-average number of shares outstanding of each class of common stock reflects changes in ownership over the periods presented. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity . Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding, participating securities and, if dilutive, potential class A common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive class A common stock equivalents may consist of: (1) shares of class A common stock issuable upon the conversion of series A, B and C preferred stock and class B and C common stock based on the conversion rates in effect through the period, and (2) incremental shares of class A common stock calculated by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of employee stock options, the assumed purchase of stock under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the assumed vesting of unearned performance shares.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) Note 12—Income Taxes For the three and six months ended March 31, 2022, the effective income tax rates were 20 % and 19 %, respectively, and for the three and six months ended March 31, 2021, the effective income tax rates were 17 %. The difference in the effective tax rates is primarily due to $ 66 million and $ 147 million of tax benefits recognized during the three and six months ended March 31, 2021, respectively, as a result of the conclusion of audits by taxing authorities. During the three and six months ended March 31, 2022, the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by $ 65 million and $ 143 million, respectively. The Company’s net unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably impact the effective tax rate, increased by $ 17 million and $ 46 million, respectively. The change in unrecognized tax benefits is primarily related to various tax positions across several jurisdictions. The Company’s tax filings are subject to examination by U.S. federal, state and foreign taxing authorities. The timing and outcome of the final resolutions of the various ongoing income tax examinations are highly uncertain. It is not reasonably possible to estimate the increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. Note 13—Legal Matters The Company is party to various legal and regulatory proceedings. Some of these proceedings involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. Accordingly, except as disclosed, the Company has not established reserves or ranges of possible loss related to these proceedings, as at this time in the proceedings, the matters do not relate to a probable loss and/or the amount or range of losses are not reasonably estimable. Although the Company believes that it has strong defenses for the litigation and regulatory proceedings described below, it could, in the future, incur judgments or fines or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. From time to time, the Company may engage in settlement discussions or mediations with respect to one or more of its outstanding litigation matters, either on its own behalf or collectively with other parties. The litigation accrual is an estimate and is based on management’s understanding of its litigation profile, the specifics of each case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management’s best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date. The following table summarizes the activity related to accrued litigation: Six Months Ended March 31, 2022 2021 (in millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 983 $ 914 Provision for uncovered legal matters 1 3 Provision for covered legal matters 150 9 Payments for legal matters ( 365 ) ( 40 ) Balance at end of period $ 769 $ 886 Accrual Summary—U.S. Covered Litigation Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A. and Visa International are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, which the Company refers to as the U.S. covered litigation. An accrual for the U.S. covered litigation and a charge to the litigation provision are recorded when a loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. In making this determination, the Company evaluates available information, including but not limited to actions taken by the Company’s litigation committee. The total accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the escrow account balance. See further discussion below under U.S. Covered Litigation and Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans. 24 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) The following table summarizes the accrual activity related to U.S. covered litigation: Six Months Ended March 31, 2022 2021 (in millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 881 $ 888 Provision for interchange multidistrict litigation 145 — Payments for U.S. covered litigation ( 262 ) ( 7 ) Balance at end of period $ 764 $ 881 During the six months ended March 31, 2022, the Company recorded an additional accrual of $ 145 million and deposited $ 250 million into the U.S. litigation escrow account to address claims of certain merchants who opted out of the Amended Settlement Agreement. During the six months ended March 31, 2022, the Company paid $ 262 million for U.S. covered litigation. The U.S. covered litigation accrual balance is consistent with the Company’s estimate of its share of the lower end of a probable and reasonably estimable loss with respect to U.S. covered litigation. While this estimate is consistent with the Company’s view of the current status of the litigation, the probable and reasonably estimable loss or range of such loss could materially vary based on developments in the litigation. The Company will continue to consider and reevaluate this estimate in light of the substantial uncertainties with respect to the litigation. The Company is unable to estimate a potential loss or range of loss, if any, at trial if negotiated resolutions cannot be reached. Accrual Summary—VE Territory Covered Litigation Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the Europe retrospective responsibility plan. Unlike the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Europe retrospective responsibility plan does not have an escrow account that is used to fund settlements or judgments. The Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through periodic adjustments to the conversion rates applicable to the series B and C preferred stock. An accrual for the VE territory covered losses and a reduction to stockholders’ equity will be recorded when the loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. See further discussion below under VE Territory Covered Litigation and Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . The following table summarizes the accrual activity related to VE territory covered litigation: Six Months Ended March 31, 2022 2021 (in millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 102 $ 21 Provision for VE territory covered litigation 5 9 Payments for VE territory covered litigation ( 102 ) ( 28 ) Balance at end of period $ 5 $ 2 U.S. Covered Litigation Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) - Individual Merchant Actions Visa has reached settlements with a number of merchants representing approximately 50 % of the Visa-branded payment card sales volume of merchants who opted out of the Amended Settlement Agreement with the Damages Class plaintiffs. 25 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) VE Territory Covered Litigation Europe Merchant Litigation Since July 2013, in excess of 850 Merchants (the capitalized term “Merchant,” when used in this section, means a merchant together with subsidiary/affiliate companies that are party to the same claim) have commenced proceedings against Visa Europe, Visa Inc. and other Visa subsidiaries in the UK, Belgium, Poland and Israel primarily relating to interchange rates in Europe and in some cases relating to fees charged by Visa and certain Visa rules. As of the filing date, Visa has settled the claims asserted by over 150 Merchants, leaving more than 650 Merchants with outstanding claims. In addition, over 30 additional Merchants have threatened to commence similar proceedings. Standstill agreements have been entered into with respect to some of those threatened Merchant claims, several of which have been settled. On November 26, 2021, with respect to certain pending Merchant claims, the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) found that UK and certain other domestic and intra-European Economic Area consumer interchange fees before the introduction of the Interchange Fee Regulation (IFR) were a restriction of competition, but that the question of whether those fees, along with inter-European Economic Area fees, are a restriction of competition after the introduction of the IFR would need to be resolved at trial. Whether any interchange fees are exempt from the finding of restriction under applicable law and the assessment of damages, if any, will also need to be considered at trial. On February 1, 2022, the UK Court of Appeal granted claimants permission to appeal the CAT’s ruling and an appeal hearing is scheduled for July 2022. Other Litigation Pulse Network On April 5, 2022, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, in part, the district court’s summary judgment decision in Visa's favor, finding that Pulse has standing to pursue certain of its claims, and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings. German ATM Litigation Between December 2021 and March 2022, Visa was served with claims in Germany brought by German savings banks against Visa Europe and Visa Inc. The banks claim that Visa’s ATM rules prohibiting the charging of access fees on domestic cash withdrawals are anti-competitive and they are seeking damages. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Litigation On December 6, 2021, an amended complaint making similar allegations regarding the setting of foreign exchange rates was filed by several individuals on behalf of a nationwide class, and/or California, Washington, Massachusetts or New Jersey subclasses, of cardholders who made a transaction in a foreign currency. The amended complaint asserts claims for unjust enrichment and restitution as well as violations of the California Unfair Competition Law, the Washington Consumer Protection Act, the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act, and the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act. On January 19, 2022, Visa filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 2.

During the quarter ended March 31, 2022, economic sanctions were imposed on Russia by the U.S., European Union, United Kingdom and other jurisdictions and authorities, impacting Visa and its clients. We announced in March 2022 that we were suspending our operations in Russia. As a result, we are no longer generating revenue from domestic and cross-border activities related to Russia. Since 2015, domestic transactions have been processed by Russia’s state-owned payments operator, National Payment Card System. With respect to cross-border activities, all transactions initiated with Visa cards issued by financial institutions outside Russia no longer work within Russia, and all transactions on cards issued in Russia no longer work outside the country. Furthermore, we have deconsolidated our Russian subsidiary, as required under U.S. GAAP. For the first half of fiscal 2022 and full year fiscal 2021, total net revenues from Russia, including revenues driven by domestic as well as cross-border activities, were approximately 4% of our consolidated net revenues. With respect to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, our priority is ensuring the safety and security of our colleagues and their families who are directly impacted. We are in close contact with those in the region and are providing ongoing support to our colleagues. COVID-19. As the effects of the evolving COVID-19 pandemic continue, our priority remains the safety of our employees, clients and the communities in which we live and operate. We are taking a phased approach to reopening our offices, with our U.S. employees returning to offices in April 2022 in a new hybrid model of flexible work. The ongoing effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and COVID-19 are difficult to predict due to numerous uncertainties identified in Part II, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-Q. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business. Highlights for the first half of fiscal 2022. For the three and six months ended March 31, 2022, net revenues increased 25% over both the prior-year comparable periods, primarily due to the growth in nominal payments volume, processed transactions and nominal cross-border volume, partially offset by higher client incentives. Net revenues were also positively impacted by our suspension of operations in Russia. See Results of Operations — Net Revenues below for further discussion. During the three and six months ended March 31, 2022, exchange rate 28 Table of Contents movements and our hedging program negatively impacted our net revenues growth by approximately one percentage point. For the three and six months ended March 31, 2022, GAAP operating expenses increased 11% and 17% over the prior-year comparable periods, respectively, primarily driven by higher personnel expense reflecting our strategy to invest in future growth and expenses incurred as a result of steps taken to support our employees in Russia and Ukraine, and higher marketing expense as we lapped planned delays in spending in the prior year. For the six months ended March 31, 2022, GAAP operating expenses also included higher litigation provision. During the three and six months ended March 31, 2022, exchange rate movements positively impacted our operating expense growth by approximately three percentage points and two percentage points, respectively. For the three and six months ended March 31, 2022, non-GAAP operating expenses increased 16% over both the prior-year comparable periods, primarily due to higher marketing expense as we lapped planned delays in spending in the prior year, higher personnel expense reflecting our strategy to invest in future growth and higher general and administrative expense related to the suspension of our operations in Russia and higher usage of travel related card benefits. Acquisitions. On December 20, 2021, we acquired The Currency Cloud Group Limited (“Currencycloud”), a UK-based global platform that enables banks and fintechs to provide innovative foreign exchange solutions for cross-border payments, for a total purchase consideration of $893 million (which includes the fair value of our previously held equity interest in Currencycloud). On March 10, 2022, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Tink AB (“Tink”) for $1.9 billion in cash. Tink is a European open banking platform that enables financial institutions, fintechs and merchants to build financial products and services and move money. See Note 2—Acquisitions to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Interchange multidistrict litigation. During the six months ended March 31, 2022, we recorded an additional accrual of $145 million to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. We also deposited $250 million into the U.S. litigation escrow account. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 13—Legal Matters to our unaudited consolidated financial statements . Common stock repurchases. In December 2021, our board of directors authorized a $12.0 billion share repurchase program . During the six months ended March 31, 2022, we repurchased 34 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market for $7.1 billion. As of March 31, 2022, our repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $9.8 billion. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Non-GAAP financial results. We use non-GAAP financial measures of our performance which exclude certain items which we believe are not representative of our continuing operations, as they may be non-recurring or have no cash impact, and may distort our longer-term operating trends. We consider non-GAAP measures useful to investors because they provide greater transparency into management’s view and assessment of our ongoing operating performance. • Gains and losses on equity investments. Gains and losses on equity investments include periodic non-cash fair value adjustments and gains and losses upon sale of an investment. These long-term investments are strategic in nature and are primarily private company investments. Gains and losses and the related tax impacts associated with these investments are tied to the performance of the companies that we invest in and therefore do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business. • Amortization of acquired intangible assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, customer relationships and brands acquired in connection with business combinations executed beginning in fiscal 2019. Amortization charges for our acquired intangible assets are non-cash and are significantly affected by the timing, frequency and size of our acquisitions, rather than our core operations. As such, we have excluded this amount and the related tax impact to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance. • Acquisition-related costs. Acquisition-related costs consist primarily of one-time transaction and integration costs associated with our business combinations. These costs include professional fees, technology integration fees, restructuring activities and other direct costs related to the purchase and integration of 29 Table of Contents acquired entities. These costs also include retention equity and deferred equity compensation when they are agreed upon as part of the purchase price of the transaction but are required to be recognized as expense post-combination. We have excluded these amounts and the related tax impacts as the expenses are recognized for a limited duration and do not reflect the underlying performance of our business. • Litigation provision. During the six months ended March 31, 2022, we recorded an additional accrual to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation of $145 million, and related tax benefit of $32 million determined by applying applicable tax rates. Under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, we recover the monetary liabilities related to the U.S. covered litigation through a downward adjustment to the conversion rate of our class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 13—Legal Matters to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. • Russia-Ukraine charges. During the three and six months ended March 31, 2022, we recorded a loss within general and administrative expense of $35 million from the deconsolidation of our Russian subsidiary. See Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. We also incurred charges of $25 million in personnel expense as a result of steps taken to support our employees in Russia and Ukraine. We have excluded these amounts and the related tax benefit of $4 million, determined by applying applicable tax rates, as they are one-time charges and do not reflect the underlying performance of our business. • Indirect taxes . During the three and six months ended March 31, 2021, we recognized a one-time charge within general and administrative expense of $152 million, and related tax benefit of $40 million determined by applying applicable tax rates. This charge is to record our estimate of probable additional indirect taxes, related to prior periods, for which we could be liable as a result of certain changes in applicable law. This one-time charge is not representative of our ongoing operations. Non-GAAP operating expenses, non-operating income (expense), income tax provision, effective income tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share should not be relied upon as substitutes for, or considered in isolation from, measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following tables reconcile our as-reported financial measures, calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to our respective non-GAAP financial measures: Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 Operating Expenses Non-operating Income (Expense) Income Tax Provision Effective Income Tax Rate (1) Net Income Diluted Earnings Per Share (1) (in millions, except percentages and per share data) As reported $ 2,387 $ (260) $ 895 19.7 % $ 3,647 $ 1.70 (Gains) losses on equity investments, net — 127 28 99 0.05 Amortization of acquired intangible assets (20) — 4 16 0.01 Acquisition-related costs (20) — 2 18 0.01 Russia-Ukraine charges (60) — 4 56 0.03 Non-GAAP $ 2,287 $ (133) $ 933 19.6 % $ 3,836 $ 1.79 30 Table of Contents Six Months Ended March 31, 2022 Operating Expenses Non-operating Income (Expense) Income Tax Provision Effective Income Tax Rate (1) Net Income Diluted Earnings Per Share (1) (in millions, except percentages and per share data) As reported $ 4,670 $ (139) $ 1,833 19.4 % $ 7,606 $ 3.54 (Gains) losses on equity investments, net — (104) (14) (90) (0.04) Amortization of acquired intangible assets (33) — 7 26 0.01 Acquisition-related costs (30) — 4 26 0.01 Litigation provision (145) — 32 113 0.05 Russia-Ukraine charges (60) — 4 56 0.03 Non-GAAP $ 4,402 $ (243) $ 1,866 19.4 % $ 7,737 $ 3.60 Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 Operating Expenses Non-operating Income (Expense) Income Tax Provision Effective Income Tax Rate (1) Net Income Diluted Earnings Per Share (1) (in millions, except percentages and per share data) As reported $ 2,148 $ 47 $ 602 16.6 % $ 3,026 $ 1.38 (Gains) losses on equity investments, net — (156) (35) (121) (0.05) Amortization of acquired intangible assets (13) — 3 10 — Acquisition-related costs (5) — 1 4 — Indirect taxes (152) — 40 112 0.05 Non-GAAP $ 1,978 $ (109) $ 611 16.8 % $ 3,031 $ 1.38 Six Months Ended March 31, 2021 Operating Expenses Non-operating Income (Expense) Income Tax Provision Effective Income Tax Rate (1) Net Income Diluted Earnings Per Share (1) (in millions, except percentages and per share data) As reported $ 3,991 $ (49) $ 1,224 16.6 % $ 6,152 $ 2.80 (Gains) losses on equity investments, net — (172) (39) (133) (0.06) Amortization of acquired intangible assets (25) — 6 19 0.01 Acquisition-related costs (8) — 2 6 — Indirect taxes (152) — 40 112 0.05 Non-GAAP $ 3,806 $ (221) $ 1,233 16.7 % $ 6,156 $ 2.80 (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Effective income tax rate, diluted earnings per share and their respective totals are calculated based on unrounded numbers. Payments volume and processed transactions. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues. Payments volume represents the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, V PAY and Interlink brands and excludes Europe co-badged volume. Nominal payments volume is denominated in U.S. dollars and is calculated each quarter by applying an established U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rate for each local currency in which our volumes are reported. Processed transactions represent transactions using cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, V PAY, Interlink and PLUS brands processed on Visa’s networks. 31 Table of Contents The following table presents nominal payments and cash volume: U.S. International Visa Inc.

Results of Operations Net Revenues The following table presents our net revenues earned in the U.S. and internationally: Three Months Ended March 31, Six Months Ended March 31, 2022 2021 % Change (1) 2022 2021 % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) U.S. $ 3,079 $ 2,683 15 % $ 6,257 $ 5,350 17 % International 4,110 3,046 35 % 7,991 6,066 32 % Net revenues $ 7,189 $ 5,729 25 % $ 14,248 $ 11,416 25 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. Net revenues increased during the three and six-month comparable periods primarily due to the growth in nominal payments volume, processed transactions and nominal cross-border volume, partially offset by higher client incentives. Net revenues were also positively impacted by our suspension of operations in Russia. See further discussion below. Our net revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. During the three and six months ended March 31, 2022, exchange rate movements and our hedging program negatively impacted our net revenues growth by approximately one percentage point. The following table presents the components of our net revenues: Three Months Ended March 31, Six Months Ended March 31, 2022 2021 % Change (1) 2022 2021 % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Service revenues $ 3,521 $ 2,845 24 % $ 6,714 $ 5,522 22 % Data processing revenues 3,480 2,996 16 % 7,094 6,029 18 % International transaction revenues 2,208 1,488 48 % 4,382 2,939 49 % Other revenues 474 392 21 % 923 776 19 % Client incentives (2,494) (1,992) 25 % (4,865) (3,850) 26 % Net revenues $ 7,189 $ 5,729 25 % $ 14,248 $ 11,416 25 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. • Service revenues increased primarily due to 20% and 19% growth in nominal payments volume during the three and six-month comparable periods, respectively. In addition, while we normally would have recognized revenues in fiscal third quarter based on fiscal second quarter payments volume, as a result of the suspension of our operations in Russia, this quarter we recognized revenues from our Russian clients based on fiscal second quarter payments volume. 33 Table of Contents • Data processing revenues increased primarily due to overall growth in processed transactions of 19% and 20% during the three and six-month comparable periods, respectively, partially offset by unfavorable business mix. • International transaction revenues increased primarily due to growth in nominal cross-border volumes, excluding transactions within Europe, of 42% and 45% during the three and six-month comparable periods, respectively. International transaction revenues also increased due to select pricing modifications and fluctuations in the volatility of a broad range of currencies, partially offset by business mix. • Other revenues increased primarily due to higher consulting and marketing revenues and other value added services. • Client incentives increased primarily due to growth in payments volume during the three and six-month comparable periods. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or execution of new contracts. Operating Expenses The following table presents the components of our total operating expenses: Three Months Ended March 31, Six Months Ended March 31, 2022 2021 % Change (1) 2022 2021 % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Personnel $ 1,226 $ 1,114 10 % $ 2,351 $ 2,095 12 % Marketing 314 206 53 % 594 411 45 % Network and processing 190 179 7 % 380 352 8 % Professional fees 125 82 53 % 225 165 36 % Depreciation and amortization 207 201 3 % 405 398 2 % General and administrative 325 363 (10 %) 567 566 — % Litigation provision — 3 NM 148 4 NM Total operating expenses $ 2,387 $ 2,148 11 % $ 4,670 $ 3,991 17 % NM - Not meaningful (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. Total operating expenses increased primarily due to the planned delay of our spend as revenue was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in the first half of the prior year. Total operating expenses were also impacted by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. • Personnel expenses increased primarily due to higher headcount and compensation, reflecting our strategy to invest in future growth, and expenses incurred as a result of steps taken to support our employees in Russia and Ukraine. • Marketing expenses increased as we lapped planned delays in spending in the prior year as well as higher spending in various campaigns, including the Beijing 2022 Olympics Winter Games, and client marketing . • Network and processing expenses increased mainly due to higher continued technology and processing network investments to support growth. • Professional fees increased primarily due to higher consulting fees as we lapped planned delays in spending in the prior year. • General and administrative expenses decreased and was approximately flat during the three and six months ended March 31, 2022, respectively, primarily due to a one-time charge of indirect taxes in the prior year, partially offset by increases in expenses due to the suspension of our operations in Russia, deconsolidation of our Russian subsidiary and higher usage of travel related card benefits. 34 Table of Contents • Litigation provision increased during the six months ended March 31, 2022 primarily due to an additional $145 million accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 13—Legal Matters to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Non-operating Income (Expense) The following table presents the components of our non-operating income (expense): Three Months Ended March 31, Six Months Ended March 31, 2022 2021 % Change (1) 2022 2021 % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Interest expense, net $ (134) $ (121) 10 % $ (268) $ (257) 4 % Investment income and other (126) 168 (174 %) 129 208 (38 %) Total non-operating income (expense) $ (260) $ 47 (644 %) $ (139) $ (49) 185 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. • Interest expense, net increased in the three and six months ended March 31, 2022 primarily as a result of higher interest expense related to income taxes liabilities. The increase in the six months ended March 31, 2022 was partially offset by lower interest expense due to lower outstanding debt and derivative instruments that lowered the cost of borrowing. • Investment income and other decreased in the three months ended March 31, 2022 primarily due to losses on our equity investments. Investment income and other decreased in the six months ended March 31, 2022 primarily due to lower gains on our equity investments. Effective Income Tax Rate The following table presents our effective income tax rates: Three Months Ended March 31, Six Months Ended March 31, 2022 2021 2022 2021 Effective income tax rate 20 % 17 % 19 % 17 % The difference in the effective tax rates is primarily due to $66 million and $147 million of tax benefits recognized during the three and six months ended March 31, 2021, respectively, as a result of the conclusion of audits by taxing authorities. 35 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Data The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the periods presented: Six Months Ended March 31, 2022 2021 (in millions) Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 7,721 $ 6,842 Investing activities (2,332) 1,474 Financing activities (8,367) (7,945) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents (305) 16 Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents $ (3,283) $ 387 Operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended March 31, 2022 was higher than the prior-year comparable period primarily due to growth in our underlying business, partially offset by higher client incentive payments. Investing activities. Cash was used in investing activities for the six months ended March 31, 2022 as compared to cash provided by investing activities during the prior-year comparable period, primarily due to higher cash paid for acquisitions, net of cash and restricted cash acquired, and lower proceeds from sales and maturities, net of purchases of investment securities. See Note 2—Acquisitions and Note 4—Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities for the six months ended March 31, 2022 was higher than the prior-year comparable period primarily due to higher share repurchases and higher dividends paid, partially offset by the absence of the principal debt payment made in the prior year and proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper in the current year. See Note 7—Debt and Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements . Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings and the returns that these holdings provide. Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our current and projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances. Commercial paper program . We maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. The carrying amount outstanding at March 31, 2022 of $300 million was fully repaid in April 2022. See Note 7—Debt to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Uses of Liquidity There has been no significant change to our primary uses of liquidity since September 30, 2021, except as discussed below. Common stock repurchases. During the six months ended March 31, 2022, we repurchased shares of our class A common stock in the open market for $7.1 billion. As of March 31, 2022, our repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $9.8 billion. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. 36 Table of Contents Dividends . During the six months ended March 31, 2022, we declared and paid $1.6 billion in dividends to holders of our common and preferred stock. On April 22, 2022, our board of directors declared a cash dividend in the amount of $0.375 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and series A, B and C convertible participating preferred stock on an as-converted basis). See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. All preferred and class B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends. Senior notes . Principal payments on our fixed-rate senior notes of $1.0 billion and $2.3 billion are due in September 2022 and December 2022, respectively, for which we have sufficient liquidity. See Note 7—Debt to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Litigation. During December 2021, we deposited $250 million into the U.S. litigation escrow account to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. The balance of this account as of March 31, 2022 was $882 million and is reflected as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 13—Legal Matters to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Acquisitions . On December 20, 2021, we acquired Currencycloud for a total purchase consideration of $893 million (which includes the fair value of our previously held equity interest in Currencycloud), and on March 10, 2022, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Tink for $1.9 billion in cash. See Note 2—Acquisitions to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-04, which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. Subsequently, the FASB also issued an amendment to this standard. The amendments in the ASU are effective upon issuance through December 31, 2022. We are evaluating the effect ASU 2020-04 and its subsequent amendment will have on our consolidated financial statements. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk There have been no significant changes to our market risks since September 30, 2021. ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) of Visa Inc. at the end of the period covered by this report and, based on such evaluation, have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures of Visa Inc. were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of such date. Changes in internal control over financial reporting. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during our second quarter of fiscal 2022 that have materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. 37 Table of Contents PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings. Refer to Note 13—Legal Matters to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q for a description of the Company’s current material legal proceedings. ITEM 1A. Risk Factors. There have been no material updates to the “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2021, other than as set forth below . Business Risks Global economic, political, market, health and social events or conditions, including the invasion of Ukraine by Russia and the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, may harm our business. More than half of our net revenues are earned outside the U.S. International cross-border transaction revenues represent a significant part of our revenue and are an important part of our growth strategy. Our revenues are dependent on the volume and number of payment transactions made by consumers, governments, and businesses whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic, political, market, health and social events or conditions. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including recessions, inflation, high unemployment, currency fluctuations, actual or anticipated large-scale defaults or failures, or a slowdown of global trade could decrease consumer and corporate confidence and reduce consumer, small business, government, and corporate spending which have a direct impact on our revenues. In addition, outbreaks of illnesses, pandemics like COVID-19, or other local or global health issues, political uncertainties, international hostilities, armed conflict, or unrest, climate-related events, including the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, and natural disasters could negatively impact our operations, clients, third-party suppliers, activities in a particular location or globally, and cross-border travel and spend. Geopolitical trends towards nationalism, protectionism, and restrictive visa requirements, as well as continued activity and uncertainty around economic sanctions, tariffs or trade restrictions could limit the expansion of our business in certain regions. In addition, as governments, investors and other stakeholders face additional pressures to accelerate actions to address climate change and other environmental, governance and social topics, governments may implement regulations or investors and other stakeholders may impose new expectations or focus investments in ways that cause significant shifts in disclosure, commerce and consumption behaviors that may have negative impacts on our business. As a result of any of these factors, any decline in cross-border travel and spend could impact the number of cross-border transactions we process and our currency exchange activities, which in turn would reduce our international transaction revenues. Starting in February 2022, the U.S. imposed sanctions against Russia, and may impose additional material financial and economic sanctions and export controls against certain Russian organizations and/or individuals, with similar actions either implemented or planned by the European Union, United Kingdom and other jurisdictions and authorities. Visa is complying, and will continue to comply, with all applicable global sanctions. We announced in March 2022 that we were suspending our operations in Russia. As a result, we are no longer generating revenue from domestic and cross-border activities related to Russia. For the first half of fiscal 2022 and full year fiscal 2021, total net revenues from Russia, including revenues driven by domestic as well as cross-border activities, were approximately 4% of our consolidated net revenues. All transactions initiated with Visa cards issued by financial institutions outside Russia no longer work within Russia, and all transactions on cards issued in Russia no longer work outside the country. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and any further actions by, or in response to such actions by, Russia or its allies could have lasting impact on Ukraine as well as other regional and global economies, any or all of which could adversely affect our business; including, but not limited to, accelerating efforts in certain countries to mitigate the risk of potential sanctions on their economies by bolstering their own domestic payment capabilities or implementing other nationalistic laws or policies, as well increased cyber-threats from state sponsored or nation-state actors. A decline in economic, political, market, health and social conditions could impact our clients as well, and their decisions could reduce the number of cards, accounts, and credit lines of their account holders, which ultimately impact our revenues. They may also implement cost-reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate marketing budgets, and decrease spending on optional or enhanced value added services from us. Any events or conditions 38 Table of Contents that impair the functioning of the financial markets, tighten the credit market, or lead to a downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access the capital and credit markets on favorable terms, which could affect our liquidity and capital resources, or significantly increase our cost of capital. If clients default on their settlement obligations, it may also impact our liquidity. Any of these events could adversely affect our volumes and revenue. The ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic remain difficult to predict due to numerous uncertainties, including the transmissibility and severity of new variants of the virus; the uptake and effectiveness of health and safety measures or actions that are voluntarily adopted by the public or required by governments or public health authorities, including the availability of vaccines and treatments; the impact of the reopening of borders and resumption of international travel; and the impact to our employees and our operations, the business of our clients, suppliers and business partners; and other factors such as: • third party disruptions, including potential outages at network providers, call centers and other suppliers; • increased consumer dispute volumes due to travel or event cancellations and the speed or accuracy in processing refunds; • increased cyber and payment fraud risk, as cybercriminals attempt DDoS related attacks, phishing scams and other disruptive actions, given the shift to online banking, ecommerce and other online activity, as well as more employees working remotely as a result of the ongoing pandemic; • challenges to the availability and reliability of our network due to changes to normal operations, including the possibility of one or more clusters of COVID-19 cases occurring at our data centers, affecting our employees, or affecting the systems or employees of our issuers, acquirers or merchants; • additional regulatory requirements, including, for example, government initiatives or requests to reduce or eliminate payments fees or other costs. A number of countries have taken steps to temporarily cap interchange or other fees on electronic payments as part of their COVID-19 economic relief measures. It is possible that some or all of these caps may become permanent over time, or that we see governments introduce additional and/or new pricing caps in future economic relief initiatives. In addition, proponents of interchange and/or MDR regulation may try to position government intervention as necessary to support recovery efforts. In an overall soft global economy, such pricing measures could result in additional financial pressures on our business; and • workforce impacts, such as difficulty recruiting, retaining, training, motivating and developing employees due to evolving health and safety protocols; changing worker expectations and talent marketplace variability regarding flexible work models; restrictions on immigration, travel and employee mobility; and the challenges of maintaining our strong corporate culture, which values communication, collaboration and connections, while some employees continue to work from home. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 2.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Organization. Visa Inc. (“Visa” or the “Company”) is a global payments technology company that facilitates global commerce and money movement across more than 200 countries and territories. Visa and its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries operate one of the world’s largest electronic payments network — VisaNet — which provides transaction processing services (primarily authorization, clearing and settlement). The Company offers products and solutions that facilitate secure, reliable and efficient money movement for all participants in the ecosystem. Visa is not a financial institution and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders of Visa products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, Visa’s financial institution clients. Consolidation and basis of presentation. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The Company consolidates its majority-owned and controlled entities, including variable interest entities (“VIEs”) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company’s investments in VIEs have not been material to its unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) requirements for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and, consequently, do not include all of the annual disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. Reference should be made to the Visa Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2021 for additional disclosures, including a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. The results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of results for the full year. Use of estimates. The preparation of the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained, and will be recognized in the period in which such changes occur. Future actual results could differ materially from these estimates. As the effects of the evolving coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic continue, much remains uncertain. There have been no comparable recent events and as a result the ultimate impact of COVID-19 and the extent to which COVID-19 and new variants continue to impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2019-12, which simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in the existing guidance and making other minor improvements. The Company adopted this guidance effective October 1, 2021. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01, which clarifies that an entity should consider observable transactions that require it to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting for purposes of applying the fair value measurement alternative. The Company adopted this guidance effective October 1, 2021. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 10 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) Note 2—Acquisitions Closed Acquisition On December 20, 2021, Visa acquired The Currency Cloud Group Limited (“Currencycloud”), a UK-based global platform that enables banks and fintechs to provide innovative foreign exchange solutions for cross-border payments, for a total purchase consideration of $ 893 million (which includes the fair value of Visa’s previously held equity interest in Currencycloud). As a result of this transaction closing days before the quarter-end, the initial allocation of the purchase price has not yet been completed. On a provisional basis, the Company allocated $ 210 million to technology, intangible assets and deferred tax liabilities and $ 683 million to goodwill. The Company expects to finalize the purchase price allocation once the information required to complete the accounting is available, but no later than one year from the acquisition date. Pending Acquisition On June 24, 2021, Visa entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Tink AB (“Tink”) for € 1.8 billion, inclusive of cash and retention incentives. Tink is a European open banking platform that enables financial institutions, fintechs and merchants to build tailored financial management tools, products and services for European consumers and businesses based on their financial data. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory reviews and approvals. Note 3—Revenues The nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of the Company’s revenues and cash flows and how they are affected by economic factors are most appropriately depicted through the Company’s revenue categories and geographical markets.

The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the U.S. litigation escrow account balance. See Note 13—Legal Matters . The following table presents the changes in the restricted cash equivalents—U.S. litigation escrow account: Three Months Ended December 31, 2021 2020 (in millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 894 $ 901 Deposits into the litigation escrow account 250 — Payments to opt-out merchants (1) and interest earned on escrow funds — ( 7 ) Balance at end of period $ 1,144 $ 894 (1) These payments are associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. See Note 13—Legal Matters . Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plan Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rates in the Visa Europe territory (the “VE territory covered litigation”). Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover certain losses resulting from VE territory covered litigation (the “VE territory covered losses”) through a periodic adjustment to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the series B and C preferred stock. VE territory covered losses are recorded in “right to recover for covered losses” within stockholders’ equity before the corresponding adjustment to the applicable conversion rate is effected. Adjustments to the conversion rate may be executed once in any six-month period unless a single, individual loss greater than € 20 million is incurred, in which case, the six-month limitation does not apply. When the adjustment to the conversion rate is made, the amount previously recorded in “right to recover for covered losses” as contra-equity is then recorded against the book value of the preferred stock within stockholders’ equity. During the three months ended December 31, 2021, the Company recovered $ 29 million of VE territory covered losses through adjustments to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the series B and C preferred stock. 12 Table of Contents VISA INC.

Money market funds, marketable equity securities and U.S. Treasury securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. The Company’s deferred compensation liability is measured at fair value based on marketable equity securities held under the deferred compensation plan. Level 2 assets and liabilities. The fair value of U.S. government-sponsored debt securities, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. Derivative instruments are valued using inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and U.S. Treasury securities. As of December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2021, gross unrealized gains and losses were not material. As of December 31, 2021, $ 2.3 billion of the Company’s debt securities are due within one year and $ 2.1 billion is due between one to five years. 14 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis Non-marketable equity securities. The Company’s non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. These investments are classified as Level 3 due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and the fact that inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require management’s judgment. The following table summarizes the total carrying value of the Company’s non-marketable equity securities held as of December 31, 2021 including cumulative unrealized gains and losses: December 31, 2021 (in millions) Initial cost basis $ 893 Adjustments: Upward adjustments 818 Downward adjustments (including impairment) ( 13 ) Carrying amount, end of period $ 1,698 Unrealized gains and losses included in the carrying value of the Company’s non-marketable equity securities still held as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows: Three Months Ended December 31, 2021 2020 (in millions) Upward adjustments $ 224 $ 14 Downward adjustments (including impairment) $ — $ ( 2 ) The Company recognized net unrealized gains on marketable and non-marketable equity securities still held as of quarter end of $ 172 million and $ 29 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Non-financial assets and liabilities. Certain non-financial assets such as goodwill, intangible assets and property, equipment and technology are only recognized at fair value if they are deemed to be impaired. As of December 31, 2021, there were no impairment indicators. Other Fair Value Disclosures Debt. Debt instruments are measured at amortized cost on the Company’s unaudited consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the debt instruments, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying value and estimated fair value of debt was $ 20.9 billion and $ 22.5 billion, respectively. As of September 30, 2021, the carrying value and estimated fair value of debt was $ 21.0 billion and $ 22.5 billion, respectively. Other financial instruments not measured at fair value. At December 31, 2021, the carrying value of settlement receivable and payable and customer collateral approximates fair value due to their generally short maturities. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 15 Table of Contents VISA INC.

Note 8—Settlement Guarantee Management The Company indemnifies its clients for settlement losses suffered due to failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa operating rules. This indemnification creates settlement risk for the Company due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. Historically, the Company has experienced minimal losses as a result of its settlement risk guarantee. However, the Company’s future obligations, which could be material under its guarantees, are not determinable as they are dependent upon future events. The Company’s settlement exposure is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time, which vary significantly day to day. During the three months ended December 31, 2021, the Company’s maximum daily settlement exposure was $ 112.7 billion and the average daily settlement exposure was $ 72.4 billion. 16 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) The Company maintains and regularly reviews global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement exposure, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met.

As-converted class A common stock is calculated based on unrounded numbers. (2) The number of shares outstanding was less than one million. (3) Class A common stock shares outstanding reflect repurchases that settled on or before December 31, 2021 and September 30, 2021, respectively. (4) The class B to class A common stock conversion rate is presented on a rounded basis. Conversion calculations for dividend payments are based on a conversion rate rounded to the tenth decimal. Reduction in as-converted shares. Under the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, when the Company funds the U.S. litigation escrow account, the value of the Company’s class B common stock is subject to dilution through a downward adjustment to the conversion rate of the shares of class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through periodic adjustments to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the series B and C preferred stock. The deposit and recovery have the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Company’s class A common stock, because it reduces the class B common stock and the series B and C preferred stock conversion rates and consequently, reduces the as-converted class A common stock share count. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . 17 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) The following table presents the reduction in the number of as-converted class B common stock after deposit into the U.S. litigation escrow account for the three months ended December 31, 2021.

In December 2021, the Company’s board of directors authorized a new $ 12.0 billion share repurchase program. Previously, in January 2021, the Company’s board of directors authorized an $ 8.0 billion share repurchase program (the “January 2021 Program”). These authorizations have no expiration date. As of December 31, 2021, the Company’s repurchase programs had remaining authorized funds of $ 12.7 billion. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to the January 2021 Program have been completed. Dividends. On January 25, 2022, the Company’s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $ 0.375 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and series A, B and C preferred stock on an as-converted basis), which will be paid on March 1, 2022, to all holders of record as of February 11, 2022. The Company declared and paid dividends of $ 809 million and $ 703 million during the three months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 18 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) Note 10—Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to each class of shares by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding and participating securities during the period. Participating securities include the Company’s series A, B and C preferred stock and restricted stock units (“RSUs”) that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents. Net income is allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities based on its proportional ownership on an as-converted basis. The weighted-average number of shares outstanding of each class of common stock reflects changes in ownership over the periods presented. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity . Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding, participating securities and, if dilutive, potential class A common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive class A common stock equivalents may consist of: (1) shares of class A common stock issuable upon the conversion of series A, B and C preferred stock and class B and C common stock based on the conversion rates in effect through the period, and (2) incremental shares of class A common stock calculated by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of employee stock options, the assumed purchase of stock under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the assumed vesting of unearned performance shares.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) Note 11—Share-based Compensation The Company granted the following equity awards to employees and non-employee directors under the 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan, or the EIP, during the three months ended December 31, 2021: Granted Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Weighted-Average Exercise Price Non-qualified stock options 961,570 $ 43.16 $ 200.86 Restricted stock units 2,655,547 $ 201.27 Performance-based shares (1) 440,722 $ 186.50 (1) Represents the maximum number of performance-based shares which could be earned. Related to the EIP, the Company recorded share-based compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, of $ 121 million and $ 116 million for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Note 12—Income Taxes For the three months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the effective income tax rates were 19 % and 17 %, respectively. The difference in the effective tax rates is primarily due to an $ 81 million tax benefit recognized during the three months ended December 31, 2020 as a result of the conclusion of audits by taxing authorities. During the three months ended December 31, 2021, the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by $ 78 million, of which $ 29 million would favorably impact the effective tax rate, if recognized. The change in unrecognized tax benefits is primarily related to various tax positions across several jurisdictions. The Company’s tax filings are subject to examination by U.S. federal, state and foreign taxing authorities. The timing and outcome of the final resolutions of the various ongoing income tax examinations are highly uncertain. It is not reasonably possible to estimate the increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. Note 13—Legal Matters The Company is party to various legal and regulatory proceedings. Some of these proceedings involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. Accordingly, except as disclosed, the Company has not established reserves or ranges of possible loss related to these proceedings, as at this time in the proceedings, the matters do not relate to a probable loss and/or the amount or range of losses are not reasonably estimable. Although the Company believes that it has strong defenses for the litigation and regulatory proceedings described below, it could, in the future, incur judgments or fines or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. From time to time, the Company may engage in settlement discussions or mediations with respect to one or more of its outstanding litigation matters, either on its own behalf or collectively with other parties. The litigation accrual is an estimate and is based on management’s understanding of its litigation profile, the specifics of each case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management’s best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date. 20 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) The following table summarizes the activity related to accrued litigation: Three Months Ended December 31, 2021 2020 (in millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 983 $ 914 Provision for uncovered legal matters 1 1 Provision for covered legal matters 146 10 Payments for legal matters ( 103 ) ( 16 ) Balance at end of period $ 1,027 $ 909 Accrual Summary—U.S. Covered Litigation Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A. and Visa International are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, which the Company refers to as the U.S. covered litigation. An accrual for the U.S. covered litigation and a charge to the litigation provision are recorded when a loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. In making this determination, the Company evaluates available information, including but not limited to actions taken by the Company’s litigation committee. The total accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the escrow account balance. See further discussion below under U.S. Covered Litigation and Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans. The following table summarizes the accrual activity related to U.S. covered litigation: Three Months Ended December 31, 2021 2020 (in millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 881 $ 888 Provision for interchange multidistrict litigation 145 — Payments for U.S. covered litigation — ( 7 ) Balance at end of period $ 1,026 $ 881 During the quarter ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded an additional accrual of $ 145 million and deposited $ 250 million into the U.S. litigation escrow account to address claims of certain merchants who opted out of the Amended Settlement Agreement. The U.S. covered litigation accrual balance is consistent with the Company’s estimate of its share of the lower end of a probable and reasonably estimable loss with respect to U.S. covered litigation. While this estimate is consistent with the Company’s view of the current status of the litigation, the probable and reasonably estimable loss or range of such loss could materially vary based on developments in the litigation. The Company will continue to consider and reevaluate this estimate in light of the substantial uncertainties with respect to the litigation. The Company is unable to estimate a potential loss or range of loss, if any, at trial if negotiated resolutions cannot be reached. Accrual Summary—VE Territory Covered Litigation Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the Europe retrospective responsibility plan. Unlike the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Europe retrospective responsibility plan does not have an escrow account that is used to fund settlements or judgments. The Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through periodic adjustments to the conversion rates applicable to the series B and C preferred stock. An accrual for the VE territory covered losses and a reduction to stockholders’ equity will be recorded when the loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. See further discussion below under VE Territory Covered Litigation and Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . 21 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) The following table summarizes the accrual activity related to VE territory covered litigation: Three Months Ended December 31, 2021 2020 (in millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 102 $ 21 Provision for VE territory covered litigation 1 10 Payments for VE territory covered litigation ( 102 ) ( 9 ) Balance at end of period $ 1 $ 22 U.S. Covered Litigation Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) - Individual Merchant Actions Visa has reached settlements with a number of merchants representing approximately 40 % of the Visa-branded payment card sales volume of merchants who opted out of the Amended Settlement Agreement with the Damages Class plaintiffs. VE Territory Covered Litigation Europe Merchant Litigation Since July 2013, in excess of 800 Merchants (the capitalized term “Merchant,” when used in this section, means a merchant together with subsidiary/affiliate companies that are party to the same claim) have commenced proceedings against Visa Europe, Visa Inc. and other Visa subsidiaries in the UK, Belgium and Poland primarily relating to interchange rates in Europe and in some cases relating to fees charged by Visa and certain Visa rules. As of the filing date, Visa has settled the claims asserted by over 150 Merchants, leaving more than 650 Merchants with outstanding claims. In addition, over 30 additional Merchants have threatened to commence similar proceedings. Standstill agreements have been entered into with respect to some of those threatened Merchant claims, several of which have been settled. On November 26, 2021, with respect to certain pending Merchant claims, the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) found that UK and certain other domestic and intra-European Economic Area consumer interchange fees before the introduction of the Interchange Fee Regulation (IFR) were a restriction of competition, but that the question of whether those fees are a restriction of competition after the introduction of the IFR would need to be resolved at trial. Whether any interchange fees are exempt from the finding of restriction under applicable law and the assessment of damages, if any, will also need to be considered at trial. Other Litigation German ATM Litigation In December 2021 and January 2022, Visa was served with claims in Germany brought by German savings banks against Visa Europe and Visa Inc. The banks claim that Visa’s ATM rules prohibiting the charging of access fees on domestic cash withdrawals are anti-competitive and they are seeking damages. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Litigation On December 6, 2021, an amended complaint making similar allegations regarding the setting of foreign exchange rates was filed by several individuals on behalf of a nationwide class, and/or California, Washington, Massachusetts or New Jersey subclasses, of cardholders who made a transaction in a foreign currency. The amended complaint asserts claims for unjust enrichment and restitution as well as violations of the California Unfair Competition Law, the Washington Consumer Protection Act, the Massachusetts Consumer Protection Act, and the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act. On January 19, 2022, Visa filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. 22 Table of Contents ITEM 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This management’s discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition and the liquidity and capital resources of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Visa,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company”) on a historical basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings, as well as those factors that may affect future earnings. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 1—Financial Statements of this report. Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that relate to, among other things, the impact on our future financial position, results of operations and cash flows as a result of the ongoing effects of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic, the measures taken in response, as well as the speed and strength of an economic recovery, including the reopening of borders and resumption of international travel; prospects, developments, strategies and growth of our business; anticipated expansion of our products in certain countries; industry developments; anticipated timing and benefits of our acquisitions; expectations regarding litigation matters, investigations and proceedings; timing and amount of stock repurchases; sufficiency of sources of liquidity and funding; effectiveness of our risk management programs; and expectations regarding the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements. Forward-looking statements generally are identified by words such as “anticipates,” “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,” “projects,” “could,” “should,” “will,” “continue” and other similar expressions. All statements other than statements of historical fact could be forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made, are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. We describe risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, any of these forward-looking statements in our SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the year ended September 30, 2021 and our subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K.

A summary of our as-reported U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP operating results is as follows: Three Months Ended December 31, 2021 2020 % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages and per share data) Net revenues $ 7,059 $ 5,687 24 % Operating expenses $ 2,283 $ 1,843 24 % Net income $ 3,959 $ 3,126 27 % Diluted earnings per share $ 1.83 $ 1.42 29 % Non-GAAP operating expenses (2) $ 2,115 $ 1,828 16 % Non-GAAP net income (2) $ 3,901 $ 3,125 25 % Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (2) $ 1.81 $ 1.42 27 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. (2) For a full reconciliation of our GAAP to non-GAAP financial results, see tables in Non-GAAP financial results below. Coronavirus. As the effects of the evolving coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic continue, much remains uncertain. Our priority remains the safety of our employees, clients and the communities in which we live and operate. We are taking a phased approach to reopening our offices, with most of our employees currently working remotely. We continue to remain in close and regular contact with our employees, clients, partners and governments globally to help them navigate these challenging times. The ongoing effects of COVID-19 remain difficult to predict due to numerous uncertainties, including the transmissibility, severity, duration and resurgence of the outbreak, new variants of the virus, the uptake and effectiveness of health and safety measures or actions that are voluntarily adopted by the public or required by governments or public health authorities, including vaccines and treatments, the speed and strength of an economic recovery, including the reopening of borders and the resumption of international travel, and the impact to our employees and our operations, the business of our clients, suppliers and business partners, and other factors identified in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30 2021. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business. Highlights for the first quarter of fiscal 2022. For the three months ended December 31, 2021, net revenues were $7.1 billion, an increase of 24% over the prior-year comparable period, primarily due to the growth in nominal payments volume, processed transactions and nominal cross-border volume, partially offset by higher client incentives. During the three months ended December 31, 2021, exchange rate movements and our hedging program negatively impacted our net revenues growth by approximately one percentage point. For the three months ended December 31, 2021, GAAP operating expenses were $2.3 billion, an increase of 24% over the prior-year comparable period, primarily driven by higher litigation provision, higher personnel expenses reflecting our strategy to invest in future growth and higher marketing expenses as we lapped planned reductions in spending in the prior year. For the three months ended December 31, 2021, non-GAAP operating expenses were $2.1 billion, an increase of 16% over the prior-year comparable period, primarily due to higher personnel expenses reflecting our strategy to invest in future growth and higher marketing expenses as we lapped planned reductions in spending in the prior year. 24 Table of Contents Closed acquisition. On December 20, 2021, we acquired The Currency Cloud Group Limited (“Currencycloud”), a UK-based global platform that enables banks and fintechs to provide innovative foreign exchange solutions for cross-border payments, for a total purchase consideration of $893 million (which includes the fair value of our previously held equity interest in Currencycloud). See Note 2—Acquisitions to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Pending acquisition. On June 24, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Tink AB (“Tink”) for €1.8 billion, inclusive of cash and retention incentives. Tink is a European open banking platform that enables financial institutions, fintechs and merchants to build tailored financial management tools, products and services for European consumers and businesses based on their financial data. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory reviews and approvals. Interchange multidistrict litigation. During the three months ended December 31, 2021, we recorded an additional accrual of $145 million to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. We also deposited $250 million into the U.S. litigation escrow account. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 13—Legal Matters to our unaudited consolidated financial statements . Common stock repurchases. In December 2021, our board of directors authorized a new $12.0 billion share repurchase program . Previously, in January 2021, our board of directors authorized an $8.0 billion share repurchase program. During the three months ended December 31, 2021, we repurchased 19 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market for $4.1 billion. As of December 31, 2021, our repurchase programs had remaining authorized funds of $12.7 billion. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Non-GAAP financial results. We use non-GAAP financial measures of our performance which exclude certain items which we believe are not representative of our continuing operations, as they may be non-recurring or have no cash impact, and may distort our longer-term operating trends. We consider non-GAAP measures useful to investors because they provide greater transparency into management’s view and assessment of our ongoing operating performance. • Gains and losses on equity investments. Gains and losses on equity investments include periodic non-cash fair value adjustments and gains and losses upon sale of an investment. These long-term investments are strategic in nature and are primarily private company investments. Gains and losses and the related tax impacts associated with these investments are tied to the performance of the companies that we invest in and therefore do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business. • Amortization of acquired intangible assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, customer relationships and brands acquired in connection with business combinations executed beginning in fiscal 2019. Amortization charges for our acquired intangible assets are non-cash and are significantly affected by the timing, frequency and size of our acquisitions, rather than our core operations. As such, we have excluded this amount and the related tax impact to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance. • Acquisition-related costs. Acquisition-related costs consist primarily of one-time transaction and integration costs associated with our business combinations. These costs include professional fees, technology integration fees, restructuring activities and other direct costs related to the purchase and integration of acquired entities. It also includes retention equity and deferred equity compensation when they are agreed upon as part of the purchase price of the transaction but are required to be recognized as expense post-combination. We have excluded these amounts and the related tax impacts as the expenses are recognized for a limited duration and do not reflect the underlying performance of our business. • Litigation provision. During the three months ended December 31, 2021, we recorded an additional accrual to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation of $145 million, and related tax benefit of $32 million determined by applying applicable tax rates. Under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, we recover the monetary liabilities related to the U.S. covered litigation through a downward adjustment to the conversion rate of our class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 13—Legal Matters to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. 25 Table of Contents Non-GAAP operating expenses, non-operating income (expense), income tax provision, effective income tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share should not be relied upon as substitutes for, or considered in isolation from, measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

Effective income tax rate, diluted earnings per share and their respective totals are calculated based on unrounded numbers. Payments volume and processed transactions. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues. Payments volume represents the aggregate dollar amount of purchases made with cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, V PAY and Interlink brands and excludes Europe co-badged volume. Nominal payments volume is denominated in U.S. dollars and is calculated each quarter by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which our volumes are reported. Processed transactions represent transactions using cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, V PAY, Interlink and PLUS brands processed on Visa’s networks. 26 Table of Contents The following table presents nominal payments and cash volume: U.S. International Visa Inc.

(6) Total nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution clients, subject to review by Visa. (7) Growth on a constant-dollar basis excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar. The following table presents the number of processed transactions: Three Months Ended December 31, 2021 2020 % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Visa processed transactions 47,558 39,213 21 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. Net revenues increased primarily due to the growth in nominal payments volume, processed transactions and nominal cross-border volume, partially offset by higher client incentives. Our net revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. During the three months ended December 31, 2021, exchange rate movements and our hedging program negatively impacted our net revenues growth by approximately one percentage point. The following table presents the components of our net revenues: Three Months Ended December 31, 2021 2020 % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Service revenues $ 3,193 $ 2,677 19 % Data processing revenues 3,614 3,033 19 % International transaction revenues 2,174 1,451 50 % Other revenues 449 384 17 % Client incentives (2,371) (1,858) 28 % Net revenues $ 7,059 $ 5,687 24 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. • Service revenues increased primarily due to 18% growth in nominal payments volume. • Data processing revenues increased primarily due to overall growth in processed transactions of 21%. • International transaction revenues increased primarily due to growth in nominal cross-border volumes, excluding transactions within Europe, of 49%. • Other revenues increased primarily due to higher consulting revenues and other value added services. • Client incentives increased primarily due to growth in payments volume. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or execution of new contracts. 28 Table of Contents Operating Expenses The following table presents the components of our total operating expenses: Three Months Ended December 31, 2021 2020 % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Personnel $ 1,125 $ 981 15 % Marketing 280 205 36 % Network and processing 190 173 9 % Professional fees 100 83 19 % Depreciation and amortization 198 197 1 % General and administrative 242 203 19 % Litigation provision 148 1 NM Total operating expenses $ 2,283 $ 1,843 24 % NM - Not meaningful (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. Total operating expenses increased primarily due to our planned reduction and delay of our spend as revenue was impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in the first half of the prior year. • Personnel expenses increased primarily due to higher headcount and compensation, reflecting our strategy to invest in future growth. • Marketing expenses increased as we lapped planned reductions in spending in the prior year as well as higher spending in various campaigns . • Network and processing expenses increased mainly due to higher continued technology and processing network investments to support growth. • Professional fees increased primarily due to higher consulting fees as we lapped planned reductions in spending in the prior year. • General and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of higher usage of travel related card benefits and unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations, partially offset by lower indirect taxes. • Litigation provision increased primarily due to an additional $145 million accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 13—Legal Matters to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Non-operating Income (Expense) The following table presents the components of our non-operating income (expense): Three Months Ended December 31, 2021 2020 % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Interest expense, net $ (134) $ (136) (1 %) Investment income and other 255 40 544 % Total non-operating income (expense) $ 121 $ (96) (225 %) (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. 29 Table of Contents • Interest expense, net decreased primarily as a result of lower interest expense due to lower outstanding debt and derivative instruments that lowered the cost of borrowing, partially offset by an increase in interest expense related to income tax liabilities. • Investment income and other increased primarily due to higher gains on our equity investments. Effective Income Tax Rate The following table presents our effective income tax rates: Three Months Ended December 31, 2021 2020 Effective income tax rate 19 % 17 % The difference in the effective tax rates is primarily due to an $81 million tax benefit recognized during the three months ended December 31, 2020 as a result of the conclusion of audits by taxing authorities. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Data The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the periods presented: Three Months Ended December 31, 2021 2020 (in millions) Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 4,232 $ 3,513 Investing activities (547) 639 Financing activities (4,967) (5,572) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents (194) 304 Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents $ (1,476) $ (1,116) Operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended December 31, 2021 was higher than the prior-year comparable period primarily due to growth in our underlying business, partially offset by higher client incentive payments. Investing activities. Cash was used in investing activities for the three months ended December 31, 2021 as compared to cash provided by investing activities during the prior-year comparable period, primarily due to higher cash paid for acquisitions and lower proceeds from sales and maturities, net of purchases of investment securities. See Note 2—Acquisitions to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities for the three months ended December 31, 2021 was lower than the prior-year comparable period primarily due to the absence of the principal debt payment made in the prior year, partially offset by higher share repurchases and higher dividends paid. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements . 30 Table of Contents Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from our operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings and the returns that these holdings provide. Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our current and projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances. Uses of Liquidity There has been no significant change to our primary uses of liquidity since September 30, 2021, except as discussed below. Common stock repurchases. In December 2021, our board of directors authorized a new $12.0 billion share repurchase program. During the three months ended December 31, 2021, we repurchased 19 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market for $4.1 billion. As of December 31, 2021, our repurchase programs had remaining authorized funds of $12.7 billion. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Dividends . During the three months ended December 31, 2021, we declared and paid $809 million in dividends to holders of our common and preferred stock. On January 25, 2022, our board of directors declared a cash dividend in the amount of $0.375 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and series A, B and C convertible participating preferred stock on an as-converted basis), which will be paid on March 1, 2022, to all holders of record as of February 11, 2022. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. All preferred and class B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends. Senior notes . Principal payments on our fixed-rate senior notes of $1.0 billion and $2.3 billion are due in September 2022 and December 2022, respectively, for which we have sufficient liquidity. See Note 7—Debt to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Litigation. During December 2021, we deposited $250 million into the U.S. litigation escrow account to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 13—Legal Matters to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Closed acquisition . On December 20, 2021, we acquired Currencycloud for a total purchase consideration of $893 million (which includes the fair value of our previously held equity interest in Currencycloud). See Note 2—Acquisitions to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Pending acquisition. On June 24, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Tink for €1.8 billion, inclusive of cash and retention incentives. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory reviews and approvals. Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2020-04, which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. Subsequently, the FASB also issued an amendment to this standard. The amendments in the ASU are effective upon issuance through December 31, 2022. We are evaluating the effect ASU 2020-04 and its subsequent amendment will have on our consolidated financial statements. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk There have been no significant changes to our market risks since September 30, 2021. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 4.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Organization. Visa Inc. (“Visa” or the “Company”) is a global payments technology company that enables innovative, secure and reliable electronic payments across more than 200 countries and territories. Visa and its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries, including Visa U.S.A. Inc. (“Visa U.S.A.”), Visa International Service Association (“Visa International”), Visa Worldwide Pte. Limited, Visa Europe Limited (“Visa Europe”), Visa Canada Corporation (“Visa Canada”), Visa Technology & Operations LLC and CyberSource Corporation, operate one of the world’s largest electronic payments network — VisaNet — which facilitates authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and enables the Company to provide its financial institution and seller clients a wide range of products, platforms and value added services. Visa is not a financial institution and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders of Visa products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, Visa’s financial institution clients. Consolidation and basis of presentation. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The Company consolidates its majority-owned and controlled entities, including variable interest entities (“VIEs”) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company’s investments in VIEs have not been material to its unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) requirements for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and, consequently, do not include all of the annual disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. Reference should be made to the Visa Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2020 for additional disclosures, including a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. Use of estimates. The preparation of the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained, and will be recognized in the unaudited consolidated financial statements in the period in which such changes occur. Future actual results could differ materially from these estimates. Coronavirus (“COVID-19”) has continued to create significant uncertainty in the global economy. There have been no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect COVID-19 as a global pandemic may have, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 and the extent to which COVID-19 continues to impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Board Update (“ASU”) 2016-13, which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets and certain other instruments held at amortized cost. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2020 using the modified retrospective transition method with comparative periods continuing to be reported using the previous applicable guidance. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In accordance with ASU 2016-13, the Company uses a forward-looking expected credit loss model for financial instruments measured at amortized cost. For available-for-sale debt securities, when credit loss indicators exist and a discounted cash flow approach results in a credit loss, the credit loss will be recorded through an allowance rather 12 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) than through an other-than-temporary impairment. In addition to recording the fair value of its settlement indemnification liability, under the new standard, the Company estimates expected credit losses and recognizes an allowance for those credit losses related to its settlement indemnification obligations. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, which simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairments by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Under the amendments in ASU 2017-04, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, which is Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test. An impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2020. The adoption had no impact on the consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, which modifies the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements by removing, modifying or adding certain disclosures. The Company adopted this standard effective October 1, 2020. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Note 2—Acquisitions Terminated Acquisition On January 12, 2021, Visa and Plaid Inc. mutually terminated their merger agreement announced on January 13, 2020. See Note 13—Legal Matters . Pending Acquisitions On June 24, 2021, Visa entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Tink AB (“Tink”) for € 1.8 billion, inclusive of cash and retention incentives. Tink is a European open banking platform that enables financial institutions, fintechs and merchants to build tailored financial management tools, products and services for European consumers and businesses based on their financial data. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory reviews and approvals. On July 22, 2021, Visa entered into a definitive agreement to acquire The Currency Cloud Group Limited (“Currencycloud”), a UK-based global platform that enables banks and fintechs to provide innovative foreign exchange solutions for cross-border payments. The acquisition values Currencycloud at £ 700 million, inclusive of cash and retention incentives. The financial consideration will be reduced by the outstanding equity of Currencycloud that Visa already owns. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory reviews and approvals.

The escrow funds are held in money market investments along with interest income earned, less applicable taxes, and are classified as restricted cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets. The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the U.S. litigation escrow account balance. See Note 13—Legal Matters . The following table sets forth the changes in the restricted cash equivalents—U.S. litigation escrow account: Nine Months Ended June 30, 2021 2020 (in millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 901 $ 1,205 Return of takedown payment to the litigation escrow account — 467 Payments to opt-out merchants (1) and interest earned on escrow funds ( 7 ) ( 524 ) Balance at end of period $ 894 $ 1,148 (1) These payments are associated with the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation. See Note 13—Legal Matters . 14 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plan Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rates in the Visa Europe territory (the “VE territory covered litigation”). Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover certain losses resulting from VE territory covered litigation (the “VE territory covered losses”) through a periodic adjustment to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the UK&I and Europe preferred stock. VE territory covered losses are recorded in “right to recover for covered losses” within stockholders’ equity before the corresponding adjustment to the applicable conversion rate is effected. Adjustments to the conversion rate may be executed once in any six-month period unless a single, individual loss greater than € 20 million is incurred, in which case, the six-month limitation does not apply. When the adjustment to the conversion rate is made, the amount previously recorded in “right to recover for covered losses” as contra-equity is then recorded against the book value of the preferred stock within stockholders’ equity. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2021, the Company recovered $ 40 million and $ 55 million, respectively, of VE territory covered losses through adjustments to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the UK&I and Europe preferred stock. The following table sets forth the activities related to VE territory covered losses in preferred stock and “right to recover for covered losses” within stockholders’ equity during the nine months ended June 30, 2021: Preferred Stock Right to Recover for Covered Losses UK&I Europe (in millions) Balance as of September 30, 2020 $ 1,106 $ 1,543 $ ( 39 ) VE territory covered losses incurred (1) — — ( 38 ) Recovery through conversion rate adjustment (2) ( 35 ) ( 20 ) 53 Balance as of June 30, 2021 $ 1,071 $ 1,523 $ ( 24 ) (1) VE territory covered losses incurred reflect settlements with merchants and additional legal costs. See Note 13—Legal Matters . (2) Adjustment to right to recover for covered losses for the conversion rate adjustment differs from the actual recovered amount due to differences in foreign exchange rates between the time the losses were incurred and the subsequent recovery through the conversion rate adjustment. The following table sets forth the as-converted value of the preferred stock available to recover VE territory covered losses compared to the book value of preferred stock recorded in stockholders’ equity within the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as of June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020: June 30, 2021 September 30, 2020 As-converted Value of Preferred Stock (1),(2) Book Value of Preferred Stock (1) As-converted Value of Preferred Stock (1),(3) Book Value of Preferred Stock (1) (in millions) UK&I preferred stock $ 3,666 $ 1,071 $ 3,168 $ 1,106 Europe preferred stock 5,044 1,523 4,331 1,543 Total 8,710 2,594 7,499 2,649 Less: right to recover for covered losses ( 24 ) ( 24 ) ( 39 ) ( 39 ) Total recovery for covered losses available $ 8,686 $ 2,570 $ 7,460 $ 2,610 (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

Money market funds, marketable equity securities and U.S. Treasury securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. The Company’s deferred compensation liability is measured at fair value based on marketable equity securities held under the deferred compensation plan. Level 2 assets and liabilities. The fair value of U.S. government-sponsored debt securities, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. Derivative instruments are valued using inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and U.S. Treasury securities. As of June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, the Company held $ 1.8 billion and $ 3.8 billion of these available-for-sale investment securities, respectively. All of the Company’s long-term available-for-sale investment securities are due within one to five years . 16 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis Non-marketable equity securities. The Company’s non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. These investments are classified as Level 3 due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and the fact that inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require management’s judgment. The following table summarizes the total carrying value of the Company’s non-marketable equity securities held as of June 30, 2021 including cumulative unrealized gains and losses: June 30, 2021 (in millions) Initial cost basis $ 857 Adjustments: Upward adjustments 446 Downward adjustments (including impairment) ( 13 ) Carrying amount, end of period $ 1,290 During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, unrealized gains and losses included in the carrying value of the Company’s non-marketable equity securities still held as of June 30, 2021 and 2020 were as follows: Three Months Ended June 30, Nine Months Ended June 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 (in millions) Upward adjustments $ 180 $ 56 $ 323 $ 65 Downward adjustments (including impairment) $ — $ ( 6 ) $ ( 2 ) $ ( 6 ) The Company recognized net unrealized gains on marketable and non-marketable equity securities still held as of quarter end of $ 434 million and $ 68 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $ 610 million and $ 59 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Non-financial assets and liabilities. Long-lived assets such as goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, finite-lived intangible assets and property, equipment and technology are considered non-financial assets. The Company does not have any non-financial liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships and trade names, all of which were obtained through acquisitions. If the Company were required to perform a quantitative assessment for impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair values would generally be estimated using an income approach. As the assumptions employed to measure these assets on a non-recurring basis are based on management’s judgment using internal and external data, these fair value determinations are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company completed its annual impairment review of its indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill as of February 1, 2021, and concluded that there was no impairment. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed at June 30, 2021. Other Fair Value Disclosures Debt. Debt instruments are measured at amortized cost on the Company’s unaudited consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the debt instruments, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. As of June 30, 2021, the carrying value and estimated fair value of debt was $ 21.0 billion and $ 22.9 billion, respectively. As of September 30, 2020, the carrying value and estimated fair value of debt was $ 24.1 billion and $ 26.6 billion, respectively. 17 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) Other financial instruments not measured at fair value. The following financial instruments are not measured at fair value on the Company’s unaudited consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2021, but disclosure of their fair values is required: settlement receivable and payable and customer collateral. The estimated fair value of such instruments at June 30, 2021 approximates their carrying value due to their generally short maturities. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

Senior Notes During the nine months ended June 30, 2021, the Company repaid $ 3.0 billion of principal upon maturity of its senior notes due December 14, 2020. Note 8—Settlement Guarantee Management The Company indemnifies its clients for settlement losses suffered due to failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa operating rules. This indemnification creates settlement risk for the Company due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. 18 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) Historically, the Company has experienced minimal losses as a result of its settlement risk guarantee. However, the Company’s future obligations, which could be material under its guarantees, are not determinable as they are dependent upon future events. The Company’s settlement exposure is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time, which vary significantly day to day. During the nine months ended June 30, 2021, the Company’s maximum daily settlement exposure was $ 104.1 billion and the average daily settlement exposure was $ 63.9 billion. The Company maintains and regularly reviews global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement exposure, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. At June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, the Company held the following collateral to manage settlement exposure: June 30, 2021 September 30, 2020 (in millions) Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents $ 2,221 $ 1,850 Pledged securities at market value 253 228 Letters of credit 1,402 1,306 Guarantees 729 717 Total $ 4,605 $ 4,101 Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity As-converted class A common stock.

As-converted class A common stock is calculated based on unrounded numbers. (2) The number of shares outstanding was less than one million. (3) Class A common stock shares outstanding reflect repurchases that settled on or before June 30, 2021 and September 30, 2020, respectively. (4) The class B to class A common stock conversion rate is presented on a rounded basis. Conversion calculations for dividend payments are based on a conversion rate rounded to the tenth decimal. Reduction in as-converted shares. Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through periodic adjustments to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the UK&I and Europe preferred stock. The recovery has the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Company’s class A common stock, because it reduces the UK&I and Europe preferred stock conversion rates and consequently, reduces the as-converted class A common stock share count. 19 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) The following table presents the reduction in as-converted UK&I and Europe preferred stock after the Company recovered VE territory covered losses through conversion rate adjustments in the nine months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020: Nine Months Ended June 30, 2021 Nine Months Ended June 30, 2020 UK&I Europe UK&I Europe (in millions, except per share data) Reduction in equivalent number of as-converted shares of class A common stock — (1) — (1) — (1) 1 Effective price per share (2) $ 220.84 $ 220.71 $ 180.00 $ 180.00 Recovery through conversion rate adjustment $ 35 $ 20 $ 72 $ 92 (1) The reduction in equivalent number of shares of class A common stock was less than one million shares. (2) Effective price per share for the quarter is calculated using the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s class A common stock over a pricing period in accordance with the Company’s current certificates of designations for its series B and C convertible participating preferred stock. Effective price per share is calculated using the weighted-average effective prices of the respective adjustments made during the year. Common stock repurchases. The following table presents share repurchases in the open market for the following periods: Three Months Ended June 30, Nine Months Ended June 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 (in millions, except per share data) Shares repurchased in the open market (1) 10 6 27 37 Average repurchase price per share (2) $ 227.11 $ 177.86 $ 213.02 $ 179.91 Total cost (2) $ 2,200 $ 1,069 $ 5,709 $ 6,572 (1) Shares repurchased in the open market reflect repurchases that settled during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. All shares repurchased in the open market have been retired and constitute authorized but unissued shares. (2) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Average repurchase price per share and total cost is calculated based on unrounded numbers. In January 2020, the Company’s board of directors authorized a $ 9.5 billion share repurchase program and in January 2021, authorized an additional $ 8.0 billion share repurchase program (the “January 2021 Program”). These authorizations have no expiration date. As of June 30, 2021, the Company’s repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $ 7.8 billion. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to the January 2021 Program have been completed. Dividends. On July 23, 2021, the Company’s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $ 0.32 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and series A, UK&I and Europe preferred stock on an as-converted basis), which will be paid on September 1, 2021, to all holders of record as of August 13, 2021. The Company declared and paid dividends of $ 698 million and $ 663 million during the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $ 2.1 billion and $ 2.0 billion during the nine months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Note 10—Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to each class of shares by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding and participating securities during the period. Net income is allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities based on its proportional ownership on an as-converted basis. The weighted-average number of shares outstanding of each class of common stock reflects changes in ownership over the periods presented. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity . 20 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding, participating securities and, if dilutive, potential class A common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive class A common stock equivalents may consist of: (1) shares of class A common stock issuable upon the conversion of series A, UK&I and Europe preferred stock and class B and C common stock based on the conversion rates in effect through the period, and (2) incremental shares of class A common stock calculated by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of employee stock options, the assumed purchase of stock under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the assumed vesting of unearned performance shares.

The weighted-average number of shares of as-converted class C common stock used in the income allocation was 42 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2021 and 43 million and 44 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020, respectively. The weighted-average number of shares of preferred stock included within participating securities was 9 million and 14 million of as-converted series A preferred stock for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, 16 million and 32 million of as-converted UK&I preferred stock for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and 22 million and 44 million of as-converted Europe preferred stock for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. (2) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Earnings per share is calculated based on unrounded numbers. (3) Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding are calculated on an as-converted basis and include incremental common stock equivalents, as calculated under the treasury stock method. The computation includes common stock equivalents of 3 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020 because their effect would have been dilutive. The computation excludes common stock equivalents of less than 1 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2021 and 1 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020, because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. (4) Participating securities include preferred stock outstanding and unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, such as the Company’s series A preferred stock, UK&I and Europe preferred stock and restricted stock units. Participating securities’ income is allocated based on the weighted-average number of shares of as-converted stock. Note 11—Share-based Compensation The Company granted the following equity awards to employees and non-employee directors under the 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan, or the EIP, during the nine months ended June 30, 2021: Granted Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Weighted-Average Exercise Price Non-qualified stock options 1,022,430 $ 39.51 $ 207.57 Restricted stock units 2,395,264 $ 208.05 Performance-based shares (1) 432,714 $ 229.81 (1) Represents the maximum number of performance-based shares which could be earned. Related to the EIP, the Company recorded share-based compensation cost, net of estimated forfeitures, of $ 153 million and $ 102 million for the three months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $ 417 million and $ 306 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. On January 26, 2021, the EIP was amended to extend the termination date from January 31, 2022 to January 26, 2031 and reduce the number of shares authorized for grant from 236 million to 198 million. Additionally, shares available for grant may be either unissued or previously issued shares subsequently acquired by the Company, except that shares withheld for taxes, or shares used to pay the exercise or purchase price of an award, shall not again be available for future grant. 22 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) Note 12—Income Taxes The effective income tax rates were 41 % and 26 % for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2021, respectively, and 19 % for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020. The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2021 differ from the effective tax rates for the same periods in the prior year primarily due to the following: • during the three months ended June 30, 2021, a $ 1.0 billion non-recurring, non-cash tax expense related to the remeasurement of UK deferred tax liabilities, as discussed below; • during the three months ended June 30, 2021, a $ 51 million tax benefit as a result of a tax position taken on certain expenses; and • during the nine months ended June 30, 2021, $ 147 million of tax benefits as a result of the conclusion of audits by taxing authorities. On June 10, 2021, the UK enacted legislation that will increase the tax rate from 19% to 25%, effective April 1, 2023. As a result, the Company recorded a non-recurring, non-cash tax expense related to the remeasurement of its net UK deferred tax liabilities, primarily related to intangibles recorded upon the acquisition of Visa Europe in fiscal 2016. During the three months ended June 30, 2021, the Company’s gross and net unrecognized tax benefits increased by $ 80 million and $ 39 million, respectively. During the nine months ended June 30, 2021, the Company’s gross and net unrecognized tax benefits decreased by $ 37 million and $ 137 million, respectively. The change in unrecognized tax benefits is related to various tax positions across several jurisdictions. Additionally, for the nine month period, the decrease in unrecognized tax benefits is primarily due to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits as a result of the conclusion of audits by taxing authorities, partially offset by increases in gross timing differences. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2021, there were no significant changes in accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020, the Company’s accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions increased by $ 18 million and $ 56 million, respectively. The Company’s tax filings are subject to examination by U.S. federal, state and foreign taxing authorities. The timing and outcome of the final resolutions of the various ongoing income tax examinations are highly uncertain. It is not reasonably possible to estimate the increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. In September 2020, the Company accepted a settlement offer related to the examination of Canadian tax returns dating back to fiscal 2003, which was subject to approval by the Tax Court of Canada. On January 21, 2021, the Tax Court of Canada approved the settlement agreement related to the examination. The Company’s income tax provision was adjusted to reflect the estimated impact of the settlement in fiscal 2020. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (the “ARP Act”) was enacted in the U.S. on March 11, 2021. The ARP Act is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial results. Note 13—Legal Matters The Company is party to various legal and regulatory proceedings. Some of these proceedings involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. Accordingly, except as disclosed, the Company has not established reserves or ranges of possible loss related to these proceedings, as at this time in the proceedings, the matters do not relate to a probable loss and/or the amount or range of losses are not reasonably estimable. Although the Company believes that it has strong defenses for the litigation and regulatory proceedings described below, it could, in the future, incur judgments or fines or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. From time to time, the Company may engage in settlement discussions or mediations with respect to one or more of its outstanding litigation matters, either on its own behalf or collectively with other parties. The litigation accrual is an estimate and is based on management’s understanding of the Company’s litigation profile, the specifics of each case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management’s best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date. 23 Table of Contents VISA INC.

Unlike the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Europe retrospective responsibility plan does not have an escrow account that is used to fund settlements or judgments. The Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through periodic adjustments to the conversion rates applicable to the UK&I preferred stock and Europe preferred stock. An accrual for the VE territory covered losses and a reduction to stockholders’ equity will be recorded when the loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable.

On April 28, 2021, a complaint was filed by Hayley Lanning and others, and on June 16, 2021, a complaint was filed by Camp Grounds Coffee and others, each against Visa and Mastercard on behalf of a purported class of merchants located in 25 states and the District of Columbia who have taken payment using the Square card acceptance service. The complaints allege violations of the antitrust laws of those jurisdictions and seek recovery for plaintiffs as indirect purchasers. To the extent that those plaintiffs’ claims are not released by the Amended Settlement Agreement, Visa believes they are covered by the U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan. Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) - Individual Merchant Actions Visa has reached settlements with a number of merchants representing approximately 40 % of the Visa-branded payment card sales volume of merchants who opted out of the Amended Settlement Agreement with the Damages Class plaintiffs. VE Territory Covered Litigation Europe Merchant Litigation Since July 2013, in excess of 700 Merchants (the capitalized term “Merchant,” when used in this section, means a merchant together with subsidiary/affiliate companies that are party to the same claim) have commenced proceedings against Visa Europe, Visa Inc. and other Visa subsidiaries in the UK, Belgium and Poland primarily relating to interchange rates in Europe and in some cases relating to fees charged by Visa and certain Visa rules. As of the filing date, Visa Europe, Visa Inc. and other Visa subsidiaries have settled the claims asserted by over 100 Merchants, leaving more than 550 Merchants with outstanding claims. In addition, over 30 additional Merchants have threatened to commence similar proceedings. Standstill agreements have been entered into with respect to some of those threatened Merchant claims, several of which have been settled. With regard to the claim asserted by one Merchant, trial before the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal to determine the lawful amount, if any, the plaintiff may be entitled to recover is set for June 2022. Other plaintiffs, whose claims were effectively stayed pending the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom's judgment, are moving their claims forward, mostly before the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal. 25 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) Other Litigation Canadian Merchant Litigation All defendants have settled with the plaintiffs. The appeals by Wal-Mart Canada and/or Home Depot of Canada Inc. of the decisions approving the Visa and Mastercard settlements have been rejected in all five provinces. Wal-Mart Canada and Home Depot of Canada Inc. sought leave to appeal the British Columbia, Quebec, Ontario and Saskatchewan Courts of Appeal decisions to the Supreme Court of Canada, and those applications were denied. Wal-Mart Canada and Home Depot of Canada Inc. chose not to appeal the Alberta Court of Appeal decision to the Supreme Court of Canada, and the Visa and Mastercard settlements are now final. EMV Chip Liability Shift On January 19, 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit denied defendants’ request to appeal the district court’s decision granting plaintiffs’ motion for class certification. Australian Competition and Consumer Commission On March 9, 2021, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission accepted an undertaking by Visa to resolve the investigation. The investigation is now closed. Euronet Litigation In the claim by Euronet 360 Finance Limited, Euronet Polska Spolka z.o.o. and Euronet Services spol. s.r.o., trial has been scheduled for a date on or after October 2, 2023. Plaid Inc. Acquisition On January 12, 2021, the case filed by the U.S. Department of Justice against Visa and Plaid was dismissed. German ATM Litigation In December 2020 and January 2021, six savings banks and cooperative banks filed claims in Germany against Visa Europe challenging Visa’s ATM rules prohibiting the charging of access fees on domestic cash withdrawals with a credit card as anti-competitive. No damages are currently sought. On December 24, 2020, 275 German savings banks initiated conciliation proceedings against Visa Europe, Visa Europe Services, LLC., and Visa Europe Services, Inc. asserting claims related to the same rules. Visa declined participation in these proceedings on March 22, 2021. On April 30, 2021, Visa filed defenses challenging the jurisdiction of the German courts to hear claims brought by certain banks. U.S. Department of Justice Civil Investigative Demand (2021) On March 26, 2021, the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the “Division”) issued a Civil Investigative Demand (“CID”) to Visa seeking documents and information regarding a potential violation of Section 1 or 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1, 2. The CID focuses on U.S. debit and competition with other payment methods and networks. Visa is cooperating with the Division in connection with the CID. On June 11, 2021, the Division issued a further CID seeking additional documents and information on the same subjects. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Litigation On July 9, 2021, a class action complaint was filed against Visa in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California by several individuals on behalf of a nationwide class, and/or California, Washington, or Illinois subclasses, of cardholders who made a transaction in a foreign currency. The complaint alleges that Visa sets foreign exchange rates in violation of Visa’s rules and bank cardholder agreements, and asserts claims for unjust enrichment and restitution as well as violations of the California Unfair Competition Law, the Washington Consumer Protection Act, and the Illinois Consumer Fraud Act. Plaintiffs seek an injunction, damages, disgorgement, and attorneys’ fees among other relief. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 2.

COVID-19 continues to have an impact globally. While we have been actively monitoring the worldwide spread of COVID-19, the extent to which COVID-19 continues to impact our business remains difficult to predict. Our priority remains the safety of our employees, clients and the communities in which we live and operate. We are taking a measured approach in bringing our employees back in the office, with most of our employees currently working remotely. We continue to remain in close and regular contact with our employees, clients, partners and with governments globally to help them navigate these challenging times. During the quarter, the year-over-year growth in payments volume, processed transactions, and cross-border volume all improved at various paces globally. The impact that COVID-19 continues to have on our business remains difficult to predict due to numerous uncertainties, including the transmissibility, severity, duration and resurgence of the outbreak, new variants of the virus, the effectiveness of social distancing measures or actions that are voluntarily adopted by the public or required by governments or public health authorities, the availability and rollout of effective treatments or vaccines, the timing of an economic recovery, and the impact to our employees and our operations, the business of our clients, supplier and business partners, and other factors identified in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30 2020, filed with the SEC on November 19, 2020. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business. Highlights for the first nine months of fiscal 2021. For the three and nine months ended June 30, 2021, net revenues were $6.1 billion and $17.5 billion, respectively, and increased 27% and 5% over the prior-year comparable periods, respectively. The three-month year-over-year changes were primarily due to the growth in nominal payments volume, processed transactions and nominal cross-border volume, as the business laps the initial impacts of COVID-19 starting in March 2020 and various markets relaxed restrictions, partially offset by higher client incentives. The nine-month year-over-year changes were primarily due to the growth in nominal payments volume and processed transactions, partially offset by higher client incentives and lower nominal cross-border volume. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2021, exchange rate movements, which are partially mitigated by our hedging program, positively impacted our net revenues by approximately one percentage point and one half of a percentage point, respectively. For the three months ended June 30, 2021, GAAP operating expenses were $2.1 billion and increased 12% over the prior-year comparable period, primarily driven by higher personnel expenses and higher marketing expenses, partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses. For the nine months ended June 30, 2021, GAAP operating expenses were $6.1 billion and increased 4% over the prior-year comparable period, primarily driven by higher personnel expenses, partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses. 28 Table of Contents For the three months ended June 30, 2021, non-GAAP operating expenses were $2.0 billion and increased 12% over the prior-year comparable period, primarily due to higher personnel expenses and higher marketing expenses, partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses. For the nine months ended June 30, 2021, non-GAAP operating expenses were $5.9 billion and increased 2% over the prior-year comparable period, primarily driven by higher personnel expenses, partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses. Non-GAAP financial results. We use non-GAAP financial measures of our performance which exclude certain items which we believe are not representative of our continuing operations, as they may be non-recurring or have no cash impact, and may distort our longer-term operating trends. We consider non-GAAP measures useful to investors because they provide greater transparency into management’s view and assessment of our ongoing operating performance. • Gains and losses on equity investments. Gains and losses on equity investments include periodic non-cash fair value adjustments and gains and losses upon sale of an investment. These long-term investments are strategic in nature and are primarily private company investments. Gains and losses and the related tax impacts associated with these investments are tied to the performance of the companies that we invest in and therefore do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business. • Amortization of acquired intangible assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, customer relationships and brands acquired in connection with business combinations executed beginning in fiscal 2019. Amortization charges for our acquired intangible assets are non-cash and are significantly affected by the timing, frequency and size of our acquisitions, rather than our core operations. As such, we have excluded this amount and the related tax impact to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance. • Acquisition-related costs. Acquisition-related costs consist primarily of one-time transaction and integration costs associated with our business combinations. These costs include professional fees, technology integration fees, restructuring activities and other direct costs related to the purchase and integration of acquired entities. It also includes retention equity and deferred equity compensation when they are agreed upon as part of the purchase price of the transaction but are required to be recognized as expense post-combination. We have excluded these amounts and the related tax impacts as the expenses are recognized for a limited duration and do not reflect the underlying performance of our business. • Remeasurement of deferred tax balances. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2021, in connection with the UK enacted legislation on June 10, 2021 that will increase the tax rate from 19% to 25%, effective April 1, 2023, we remeasured our net deferred tax liabilities, resulting in the recognition of a non-recurring, non-cash income tax expense of $1.0 billion. • Indirect taxes. During the nine months ended June 30, 2021, we recognized a one-time charge within general and administrative expense of $152 million, before tax. Net of the related income tax benefit of $40 million, determined by applying applicable tax rates, non-GAAP net income increased by $112 million. This charge is to record our estimate of probable additional indirect taxes, related to prior periods, for which we could be liable as a result of certain changes in applicable law. This one-time charge is not representative of our ongoing operations. Non-GAAP operating expense, non-operating income (expense), income tax provision, effective income tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share should not be relied upon as substitutes for, or considered in isolation from, measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following tables reconcile our as-reported financial measures, calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to our respective non-GAAP financial measures for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020. 29 Table of Contents Three Months Ended June 30, 2021 Operating Expenses Non-operating Income (Expense) Income Tax Provision Effective Income Tax Rate (1) Net Income Diluted Earnings Per Share (1) (in millions, except percentages and per share data) As reported $ 2,066 $ 325 $ 1,814 41.3 % $ 2,575 $ 1.18 (Gains) losses on equity investments, net — (439) (99) (340) (0.16) Amortization of acquired intangible assets (13) — 3 10 — Acquisition-related costs (5) — 1 4 — Remeasurement of deferred tax balances — — (1,007) 1,007 0.46 Non-GAAP $ 2,048 $ (114) $ 712 17.9 % $ 3,256 $ 1.49 Nine Months Ended June 30, 2021 Operating Expenses Non-operating Income (Expense) Income Tax Provision Effective Income Tax Rate (1) Net Income Diluted Earnings Per Share (1) (in millions, except percentages and per share data) As reported $ 6,057 $ 276 $ 3,038 25.8 % $ 8,727 $ 3.98 (Gains) losses on equity investments, net — (611) (138) (473) (0.22) Amortization of acquired intangible assets (38) — 9 29 0.01 Acquisition-related costs (13) — 3 10 — Remeasurement of deferred tax balances — — (1,007) 1,007 0.46 Indirect taxes (152) — 40 112 0.05 Non-GAAP $ 5,854 $ (335) $ 1,945 17.1 % $ 9,412 $ 4.29 Three Months Ended June 30, 2020 Operating Expenses Non-operating Income (Expense) Income Tax Provision Effective Income Tax Rate (1) Net Income Diluted Earnings Per Share (1) (in millions, except percentages and per share data) As reported $ 1,838 $ (67) $ 559 19.1 % $ 2,373 $ 1.07 (Gains) losses on equity investments, net — (51) (11) (40) (0.02) Amortization of acquired intangible assets (13) — 3 10 — Acquisition-related costs (4) — — 4 — Non-GAAP $ 1,821 $ (118) $ 551 19.0 % $ 2,347 $ 1.06 30 Table of Contents Nine Months Ended June 30, 2020 Operating Expenses Non-operating Income (Expense) Income Tax Provision Effective Income Tax Rate (1) Net Income Diluted Earnings Per Share (1) (in millions, except percentages and per share data) As reported $ 5,806 $ (204) $ 2,006 18.7 % $ 8,729 $ 3.92 (Gains) losses on equity investments, net — (62) (14) (48) (0.02) Amortization of acquired intangible assets (35) — 8 27 0.01 Acquisition-related costs (11) — 2 9 — Non-GAAP $ 5,760 $ (266) $ 2,002 18.7 % $ 8,717 $ 3.91 (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

On June 24, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Tink AB (“Tink”) for €1.8 billion, inclusive of cash and retention incentives. Tink is a European open banking platform that enables financial institutions, fintechs and merchants to build tailored financial management tools, products and services for European consumers and businesses based on their financial data. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory reviews and approvals. On July 22, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire The Currency Cloud Group Limited (“Currencycloud”), a UK-based global platform that enables banks and fintechs to provide innovative foreign exchange solutions for cross-border payments. The acquisition values Currencycloud at £700 million, inclusive of cash and retention incentives. The financial consideration will be reduced by the outstanding equity of Currencycloud that we already own. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory reviews and approvals. Common stock repurchases. During the three months ended June 30, 2021, we repurchased 10 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market for $2.2 billion. As of June 30, 2021, our repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $7.8 billion. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Payments volume and processed transactions. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues. For the three and nine months ended March 31, 2021 (1) , nominal payments volume growth in the U.S. was 18% and 11%, respectively, driven mainly by consumer debit. For the three and nine months ended March 31, 2021, nominal international payments volume growth was 10% and 4%, respectively, positively impacted by movements in U.S. dollar exchange rates. For the same comparable periods, international payments volume growth on a constant-dollar basis, which excludes the impact of exchange rate movements, was 6% and 3%, respectively. Processed transactions increased as the business laps the initial impacts of COVID-19 starting in March 2020 and the increase also reflects the ongoing worldwide shift to electronic payments. 31 Table of Contents The following table presents nominal payments and cash volume: U.S. International Visa Inc.

Therefore, service revenues reported for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, were based on nominal payments volume reported by our financial institution clients for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. (2) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes and totals are calculated based on unrounded numbers. (3) Includes consumer prepaid volume and Interlink volume. (4) Includes large, medium and small business credit and debit, as well as commercial prepaid volume. (5) Total nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume. Total nominal payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased on cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink and V PAY brands. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution clients, subject to review by Visa. On occasion, previously presented volume information may be updated. Prior-period updates are not material. (6) Growth on a constant-dollar basis excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar. 32 Table of Contents The following table provides the number of transactions involving cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink, V PAY and PLUS cards processed on Visa’s networks during the periods presented: Three Months Ended June 30, Nine Months Ended June 30, 2021 2020 % Change (1) 2021 2020 % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Visa processed transactions 42,561 30,676 39 % 119,418 103,391 16 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage change is calculated based on unrounded numbers. Results of Operations Net Revenues The following table sets forth our net revenues earned in the U.S. and internationally: Three Months Ended June 30, Nine Months Ended June 30, 2021 2020 $ Change % Change (1) 2021 2020 $ Change % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) U.S. $ 2,806 $ 2,380 $ 426 18 % $ 8,156 $ 7,747 $ 409 5 % International 3,324 2,457 867 35 % 9,390 8,998 392 4 % Net revenues $ 6,130 $ 4,837 $ 1,293 27 % $ 17,546 $ 16,745 $ 801 5 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. During the three-month comparable periods, net revenues increased primarily due to the growth in nominal payments volume, processed transactions and nominal cross-border volume, driven by fewer COVID-19 restrictions, partially offset by higher client incentives. During the nine-month comparable periods, net revenues increased primarily due to the growth in nominal payments volume and processed transactions, partially offset by higher client incentives and lower nominal cross-border volume. Our net revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2021, exchange rate movements, which are partially mitigated by our hedging program, positively impacted our net revenues by approximately one percentage point and one half of a percentage point, respectively. The following table sets forth the components of our net revenues: Three Months Ended June 30, Nine Months Ended June 30, 2021 2020 $ Change % Change (1) 2021 2020 $ Change % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Service revenues $ 2,828 $ 2,409 $ 419 17 % $ 8,350 $ 7,587 $ 763 10 % Data processing revenues 3,327 2,525 802 32 % 9,356 8,100 1,256 15 % International transaction revenues 1,696 1,102 594 54 % 4,635 4,953 (318) (6) % Other revenues 409 314 95 31 % 1,185 1,071 114 11 % Client incentives (2,130) (1,513) (617) 41 % (5,980) (4,966) (1,014) 20 % Net revenues $ 6,130 $ 4,837 $ 1,293 27 % $ 17,546 $ 16,745 $ 801 5 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. • Service revenues increased primarily due to 14% and 7% growth in nominal payments volume during the three and nine-month comparable periods, respectively. Service revenues were also impacted by select pricing modifications and business mix. 33 Table of Contents • Data processing revenues increased mainly due to overall growth in processed transactions of 39% and 16% during the three and nine-month comparable periods, respectively, as the business laps the initial impacts of COVID-19 starting in March 2020 and various markets relaxed restrictions. For the three-month comparable period, the growth of data processing revenues was negatively impacted by an unfavorable business mix. • International transaction revenues increased primarily due to growth in nominal cross-border volumes, excluding transactions within Europe, of 62% during the three-month comparable period, as the business laps the initial impacts of COVID-19 starting in March 2020 and border restrictions were relaxed in various markets. The decrease for the nine-month comparable period is mainly due to a decline in nominal cross-border volumes, excluding transactions within Europe, of 7%. International transaction revenues were also impacted by fluctuations in the volatility of a broad range of currencies and business mix . • Other revenues increased as the business laps the initial impacts of COVID-19 starting in March 2020, driven by higher consulting and data services revenues. • Client incentives increased in correlation with the increase in payments volumes during the three and nine-month comparable periods. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or execution of new contracts. Operating Expenses The following table sets forth components of our total operating expenses: Three Months Ended June 30, Nine Months Ended June 30, 2021 2020 $ Change % Change (1) 2021 2020 $ Change % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Personnel $ 1,098 $ 941 $ 157 17 % $ 3,193 $ 2,863 $ 330 12 % Marketing 268 174 94 54 % 679 683 (4) (1) % Network and processing 186 172 14 8 % 538 536 2 — % Professional fees 108 95 13 13 % 273 304 (31) (10) % Depreciation and amortization 204 197 7 3 % 602 571 31 5 % General and administrative 204 258 (54) (21) % 770 840 (70) (8) % Litigation provision (2) 1 (3) (309) % 2 9 (7) (73) % Total operating expenses $ 2,066 $ 1,838 $ 228 12 % $ 6,057 $ 5,806 $ 251 4 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. • Personnel expenses increased primarily due to increases in headcount and higher incentive compensation, reflecting our strategy to invest in future growth. • Marketing expenses increased during the three months ended June 30, 2021 as we lapped reductions in spending in the prior year at the outset of COVID-19 as well as higher spending in client marketing and various campaigns, including the Olympic Games Tokyo 2020, which were postponed until summer 2021. During the nine months ended June 30, 2021, marketing expenses decreased primarily due to the planned delay in spending to the second half of fiscal 2021 . • Network and processing expenses increased mainly due to continued technology and processing network investments to support growth. • Professional fees, which were primarily third party fees related to various corporate projects, increased during the three months ended June 30, 2021 mainly due to the planned delay of our spending to the second half of fiscal 2021. During the nine months ended June 30, 2021, professional fees decreased reflecting non-recurring expenses in the prior year, partially offset by planned delay of our spending to the second half of fiscal 2021. 34 Table of Contents • Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additional depreciation and amortization from our on-going investments, including acquisitions. • General and administrative expenses decreased in the three months ended June 30, 2021, primarily as a result of favorable foreign currency fluctuations and lower indirect taxes, partially offset by increased usage of travel related product benefits. In the nine months ended June 30, 2021, expenses decreased due to lower travel expenses, lower usage of travel related product benefits and favorable foreign currency fluctuations, partially offset by a one-time charge to record our estimate of probable additional indirect taxes, related to prior periods, for which we could be liable as a result of certain changes in applicable laws. Non-operating Income (Expense) The following table sets forth the components of our non-operating income (expense): Three Months Ended June 30, Nine Months Ended June 30, 2021 2020 $ Change % Change (1) 2021 2020 $ Change % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Interest expense, net $ (131) $ (142) $ 11 (8) % $ (388) $ (371) $ (17) 4 % Investment income and other 456 75 381 499 % 664 167 497 296 % Total non-operating income (expense) $ 325 $ (67) $ 392 (591) % $ 276 $ (204) $ 480 (235) % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. • Interest expense, net decreased during the three months ended June 30, 2021 primarily as a result of lower interest related to income tax liabilities. Interest expense, net increased during the nine-month comparable period primarily due to the issuance of debt in fiscal 2020, partially offset by lower interest due to discrete tax benefits. • Investment income and other increased in the three and nine months ended June 30, 2021 primarily due to higher gains on our equity investments, partially offset by lower interest income on our cash and investments. Effective Income Tax Rate The following table sets forth our effective income tax rates: Three Months Ended June 30, Nine Months Ended June 30, 2021 2020 2021 2020 Effective income tax rate 41 % 19 % 26 % 19 % The effective income tax rates for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2021 differ from the effective tax rates for the same periods in the prior year primarily due to the following: • during the three months ended June 30, 2021, a $1.0 billion non-recurring, non-cash tax expense related to the remeasurement of UK deferred tax liabilities, as discussed below; • during the three months ended June 30, 2021, a $51 million tax benefit as a result of a tax position taken on certain expenses; and • during the nine months ended June 30, 2021, $147 million of tax benefits as a result of the conclusion of audits by taxing authorities. On June 10, 2021, the UK enacted legislation that will increase the tax rate from 19% to 25%, effective April 1, 2023. As a result, we recorded a non-recurring, non-cash tax expense related to the remeasurement of our net UK deferred tax liabilities, primarily related to intangibles recorded upon the acquisition of Visa Europe in fiscal 2016. 35 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Data The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the periods presented: Nine Months Ended June 30, 2021 2020 (in millions) Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 11,256 $ 8,344 Investing activities 1,546 2,308 Financing activities (10,791) (4,723) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents 92 173 Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents $ 2,103 $ 6,102 Operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended June 30, 2021 was higher than the prior-year comparable period primarily due to growth in our underlying business, lower client incentive payments and the timing and impact of COVID-19 on settlement in the prior-year period. Investing activities. Cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended June 30, 2021 decreased primarily due to higher purchases of investment securities, partially offset by higher sales and maturities of investment securities as compared to the prior-year period. Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended June 30, 2021 was higher than the prior-year comparable period primarily due to the $3.0 billion principal debt payment upon maturity of our senior notes in December 2020 and the absence of proceeds received from the issuance of senior notes in the prior year, partially offset by lower share repurchases. See Note 7—Debt and Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements . Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings and the returns that these holdings provide. Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our current and projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances. Uses of Liquidity There has been no significant change to our primary uses of liquidity since September 30, 2020, except as discussed below. Common stock repurchases. During the nine months ended June 30, 2021, we repurchased 27 million shares of our class A common stock for $5.7 billion. As of June 30, 2021, our repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $7.8 billion. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. 36 Table of Contents Dividends . During the nine months ended June 30, 2021, we declared and paid $2.1 billion in dividends to holders of our common and preferred stock. On July 23, 2021, our board of directors declared a cash dividend in the amount of $0.32 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and series A, UK&I and Europe preferred stock on an as-converted basis), which will be paid on September 1, 2021, to all holders of record as of August 13, 2021. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. All preferred and class B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends. Senior notes . During the nine months ended June 30, 2021, we repaid $3.0 billion of principal upon maturity of our senior notes due December 14, 2020. See Note 7—Debt to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Pending Acquisitions . On June 24, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Tink for €1.8 billion, inclusive of cash and retention incentives. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory reviews and approvals. On July 22, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Currencycloud for a value of £700 million, inclusive of cash and retention incentives. The financial consideration will be reduced by the outstanding equity of Currencycloud that we already own. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory reviews and approvals. Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Board Update (“ASU”) 2019-12, which simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in the existing guidance for income taxes and making other minor improvements. The amendments in the ASU are effective on October 1, 2021. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01, which clarifies that an entity should consider observable transactions that require it to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting for the purposes of applying the fair value measurement alternative. The amendments in the ASU are effective on October 1, 2021. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. Subsequently, the FASB also issued an amendment to this standard. The amendments in the ASU are effective upon issuance through December 31, 2022. We are evaluating the effect ASU 2020-04 and its subsequent amendment will have on our consolidated financial statements. ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk There have been no significant changes to our market risks since September 30, 2020. ITEM 4.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Organization. Visa Inc. (“Visa” or the “Company”) is a global payments technology company that enables innovative, secure and reliable electronic payments across more than 200 countries and territories. Visa and its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries, including Visa U.S.A. Inc. (“Visa U.S.A.”), Visa International Service Association (“Visa International”), Visa Worldwide Pte. Limited, Visa Europe Limited (“Visa Europe”), Visa Canada Corporation (“Visa Canada”), Visa Technology & Operations LLC and CyberSource Corporation, operate one of the world’s largest electronic payments network — VisaNet — which facilitates authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and enables the Company to provide its financial institution and seller clients a wide range of products, platforms and value added services. Visa is not a financial institution and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders of Visa products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, Visa’s financial institution clients. Consolidation and basis of presentation. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The Company consolidates its majority-owned and controlled entities, including variable interest entities (“VIEs”) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company’s investments in VIEs have not been material to its unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) requirements for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and, consequently, do not include all of the annual disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. Reference should be made to the Visa Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2020 for additional disclosures, including a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. Use of estimates. The preparation of the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained, and will be recognized in the unaudited consolidated financial statements in the period in which such changes occur. Future actual results could differ materially from these estimates. Coronavirus (“COVID-19”) has continued to create significant uncertainty in the global economy. There have been no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect COVID-19 as a global pandemic may have, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 and the extent to which COVID-19 continues to impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Board Update (“ASU”) 2016-13, which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets and certain other instruments held at amortized cost. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2020 using the modified retrospective transition method with comparative periods continuing to be reported using the previous applicable guidance. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In accordance with ASU 2016-13, the Company uses a forward-looking expected credit loss model for financial instruments measured at amortized cost. For available-for-sale debt securities, when credit loss indicators exist and a discounted cash flow approach results in a credit loss, the credit loss will be recorded through an allowance rather 12 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) than through an other-than-temporary impairment. In addition to recording the fair value of its settlement indemnification liability, under the new standard, the Company estimates expected credit losses and recognizes an allowance for those credit losses related to its settlement indemnification obligations. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, which simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairments by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Under the amendments in ASU 2017-04, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, which is Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test. An impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2020. The adoption had no impact on the consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, which modifies the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements by removing, modifying or adding certain disclosures. The Company adopted this standard effective October 1, 2020. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Note 2—Acquisitions Terminated Acquisition. On January 12, 2021, Visa and Plaid Inc. mutually terminated their merger agreement announced on January 13, 2020. See Note 13—Legal Matters . Note 3—Revenues The nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of the Company’s revenues and cash flows and how they are affected by economic factors are most appropriately depicted through the Company’s revenue categories and geographical markets. The following tables disaggregate the Company’s net revenues by revenue category and by geography for the three and six months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020: Three Months Ended March 31, Six Months Ended March 31, 2021 2020 2021 2020 (in millions) Service revenues $ 2,845 $ 2,623 $ 5,522 $ 5,178 Data processing revenues 2,996 2,711 6,029 5,575 International transaction revenues 1,488 1,833 2,939 3,851 Other revenues 392 392 776 757 Client incentives ( 1,992 ) ( 1,705 ) ( 3,850 ) ( 3,453 ) Net revenues $ 5,729 $ 5,854 $ 11,416 $ 11,908 Three Months Ended March 31, Six Months Ended March 31, 2021 2020 2021 2020 (in millions) U.S. $ 2,683 $ 2,650 $ 5,350 $ 5,367 International 3,046 3,204 6,066 6,541 Net revenues $ 5,729 $ 5,854 $ 11,416 $ 11,908 At March 31, 2021 and September 30, 2020, deferred revenue included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets was $ 647 million and $ 533 million, respectively. 13 Table of Contents VISA INC.

The escrow funds are held in money market investments along with interest income earned, less applicable taxes, and are classified as restricted cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets. The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the U.S. litigation escrow account balance. See Note 13—Legal Matters . The following table sets forth the changes in the restricted cash equivalents—U.S. litigation escrow account: Six Months Ended March 31, 2021 2020 (in millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 901 $ 1,205 Return of takedown payment to the litigation escrow account — 467 Payments to opt-out merchants (1) and interest earned on escrow funds ( 7 ) ( 408 ) Balance at end of period $ 894 $ 1,264 (1) These payments are associated with the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation. See Note 13—Legal Matters . Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plan Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rates in the Visa Europe territory (the “VE territory covered litigation”). Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover certain losses resulting from VE territory covered litigation (the “VE territory covered losses”) through a periodic adjustment to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the UK&I and Europe preferred stock. VE territory covered losses are recorded in “right to recover for covered losses” within equity before the corresponding adjustment to the applicable conversion rate is effected. Adjustments to the conversion rate may be executed once in any six-month period unless a single, individual loss greater than € 20 million is incurred, in which case, the six-month limitation does not apply. When the adjustment to the conversion rate is made, the amount previously recorded in “right to recover for covered losses” as contra-equity is then recorded against the book value of the preferred stock within stockholders’ equity. During the six months ended March 31, 2021, the Company recovered $ 15 million of VE territory covered losses through adjustments to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the UK&I and Europe preferred stock. 14 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) The following table sets forth the activities related to VE territory covered losses in preferred stock and “right to recover for covered losses” within stockholders’ equity during the six months ended March 31, 2021.

Money market funds, marketable equity securities and U.S. Treasury securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. The Company’s deferred compensation liability is measured at fair value based on marketable equity securities held under the deferred compensation plan. Level 2 assets and liabilities. The fair value of U.S. government-sponsored debt securities, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. Derivative instruments are valued using inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and U.S. Treasury securities. As of March 31, 2021 and September 30, 2020, the Company held $ 2.0 billion and $ 3.8 billion of these available-for-sale investment securities, respectively. All of the Company’s long-term available-for-sale investment securities are due within one to five years . Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis Non-marketable equity securities. The Company’s non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. These investments are classified as Level 3 due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and the fact that inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require management’s judgment. 16 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) The following table summarizes the total carrying value of the Company’s non-marketable equity securities held as of March 31, 2021 including cumulative unrealized gains and losses: March 31, 2021 (in millions) Initial cost basis $ 858 Adjustments: Upward adjustments 355 Downward adjustments (including impairment) ( 13 ) Carrying amount, end of period $ 1,200 During the three and six months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, unrealized gains and losses included in the carrying value of the Company’s non-marketable equity securities were as follows: Three Months Ended March 31, Six Months Ended March 31, 2021 2020 2021 2020 (in millions) Upward adjustments $ 129 $ — $ 143 $ 9 Downward adjustments (including impairment) $ — $ — $ ( 2 ) $ — Non-financial assets and liabilities. Long-lived assets such as goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, finite-lived intangible assets and property, equipment and technology are considered non-financial assets. The Company does not have any non-financial liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships and trade names, all of which were obtained through acquisitions. If the Company were required to perform a quantitative assessment for impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair values would generally be estimated using an income approach. As the assumptions employed to measure these assets on a non-recurring basis are based on management’s judgment using internal and external data, these fair value determinations are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company completed its annual impairment review of its indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill as of February 1, 2021, and concluded that there was no impairment. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed at March 31, 2021. Other Fair Value Disclosures Debt. Debt instruments are measured at amortized cost on the Company’s unaudited consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the debt instruments, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. As of March 31, 2021, the carrying value and estimated fair value of debt was $ 21.0 billion and $ 22.1 billion, respectively. As of September 30, 2020, the carrying value and estimated fair value of debt was $ 24.1 billion and $ 26.6 billion, respectively. Other financial instruments not measured at fair value. The following financial instruments are not measured at fair value on the Company’s unaudited consolidated balance sheet at March 31, 2021, but disclosure of their fair values is required: settlement receivable and payable and customer collateral. The estimated fair value of such instruments at March 31, 2021 approximates their carrying value due to their generally short maturities. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 17 Table of Contents VISA INC.

Senior Notes During the six months ended March 31, 2021, the Company repaid $ 3.0 billion of principal upon maturity of its senior notes due December 14, 2020. Note 8—Settlement Guarantee Management The Company indemnifies its clients for settlement losses suffered due to failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa operating rules. This indemnification creates settlement risk for the Company due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. Historically, the Company has experienced minimal losses as a result of its settlement risk guarantee. However, the Company’s future obligations, which could be material under its guarantees, are not determinable as they are dependent upon future events. The Company’s settlement exposure is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time, which vary significantly day to day. During the six months ended March 31, 2021, the Company’s maximum daily settlement exposure was $ 99.3 billion and the average daily settlement exposure was $ 61.5 billion. 18 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) The Company maintains and regularly reviews global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement exposure, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met.

(4) The class B to class A common stock conversion rate is presented on a rounded basis. Conversion calculations for dividend payments are based on a conversion rate rounded to the tenth decimal. Reduction in as-converted shares. Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through periodic adjustments to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the UK&I and Europe preferred stock. The recovery has the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Company’s class A common stock, because it reduces the UK&I and Europe preferred stock conversion rates and consequently, reduces the as-converted class A common stock share count. 19 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) The following table presents the reduction in as-converted UK&I and Europe preferred stock after the Company recovered VE territory covered losses through conversion rate adjustments in the six months ended March 31, 2021. There were no conversion rate adjustments in the six months ended March 31, 2020.

All shares repurchased in the open market have been retired and constitute authorized but unissued shares. (2) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Average repurchase price per share and total cost is calculated based on unrounded numbers. In January 2020, the Company’s board of directors authorized a $ 9.5 billion share repurchase program and in January 2021, authorized an additional $ 8.0 billion share purchase program. These authorizations have no expiration date. As of March 31, 2021, the Company’s repurchase programs had remaining authorized funds of $ 10.0 billion. Dividends. O n April 23, 2021, the Company’s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $ 0.32 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and series A, UK&I and Europe preferred stock on an as-converted basis), which will be paid on June 1, 2021, to all holders of record as of May 14, 2021. The Company declared and paid dividends of $ 701 million and $ 668 million during the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $ 1.4 billion and $ 1.3 billion during the six months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Note 10—Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to each class of shares by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding and participating securities during the period. Net income is allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities based on its proportional ownership on an as-converted basis. The weighted-average number of shares outstanding of each class of common stock reflects changes in ownership over the periods presented. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity . 20 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding, participating securities and, if dilutive, potential class A common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive class A common stock equivalents may consist of: (1) shares of class A common stock issuable upon the conversion of series A, UK&I and Europe preferred stock and class B and C common stock based on the conversion rates in effect through the period, and (2) incremental shares of class A common stock calculated by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of employee stock options, the assumed purchase of stock under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the assumed vesting of unearned performance shares.

The computation includes common stock equivalents of 2 million and 3 million for the three and six months ended March 31, 2021, respectively, and 3 million for the three and six months ended March 31, 2020, because their effect would have been dilutive. The computation excludes common stock equivalents of 1 million for the three and six months ended March 31, 2021 and 1 million and 2 million for the three and six months ended March 31, 2020, respectively, because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. (4) Participating securities include preferred stock outstanding and unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, such as the Company’s series A preferred stock, UK&I and Europe preferred stock and restricted stock units. Participating securities’ income is allocated based on the weighted-average number of shares of as-converted stock. Note 11—Share-based Compensation The Company granted the following equity awards to employees and non-employee directors under the 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan, or the EIP, during the six months ended March 31, 2021: Granted Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Weighted-Average Exercise Price Non-qualified stock options 1,022,430 $ 39.51 $ 207.57 Restricted stock units 2,361,264 $ 207.73 Performance-based shares (1) 432,714 $ 229.81 (1) Represents the maximum number of performance-based shares which could be earned.

On January 26, 2021, the EIP was amended to extend the termination date from January 31, 2022 to January 26, 2031 and reduce the number of shares authorized for grant from 236 million to 198 million. Additionally, shares available for grant may be either unissued or previously issued shares subsequently acquired by the Company, except that shares withheld for taxes, or shares used to pay the exercise or purchase price of an award, shall not again be available for future grant. 22 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) Note 12—Income Taxes The effective income tax rates were 17 % for the three and six months ended March 31, 2021, and 19 % for the three and six months ended March 31, 2020. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to $ 66 million and $ 147 million of tax benefits recognized during the three and six months ended March 31, 2021, respectively, as a result of the conclusion of audits by taxing authorities. During the three and six months ended March 31, 2021, the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits decreased by $ 111 million and $ 117 million, respectively, and the Company’s net unrecognized tax benefits decreased by $ 127 million and $ 176 million, respectively. The decrease in unrecognized tax benefits is primarily due to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits as a result of the conclusion of audits by taxing authorities, partially offset by increases in gross timing differences as well as various tax positions across several jurisdictions. During the three and six months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no significant changes in accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. The Company’s tax filings are subject to examination by U.S. federal, state and foreign taxing authorities. The timing and outcome of the final resolutions of the various ongoing income tax examinations are highly uncertain. It is not reasonably possible to estimate the increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. In September 2020, the Company accepted a settlement offer related to the examination of Canadian tax returns dating back to fiscal 2003, which was subject to approval by the Tax Court of Canada. On January 21, 2021, the Tax Court of Canada approved the settlement agreement related to the examination. The Company’s income tax provision was adjusted to reflect the estimated impact of the settlement in fiscal 2020. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (the “ARP Act”) was enacted in the U.S. on March 11, 2021. The ARP Act is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial results. Note 13—Legal Matters The Company is party to various legal and regulatory proceedings. Some of these proceedings involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. Accordingly, except as disclosed, the Company has not established reserves or ranges of possible loss related to these proceedings, as at this time in the proceedings, the matters do not relate to a probable loss and/or the amount or range of losses are not reasonably estimable. Although the Company believes that it has strong defenses for the litigation and regulatory proceedings described below, it could, in the future, incur judgments or fines or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. From time to time, the Company may engage in settlement discussions or mediations with respect to one or more of its outstanding litigation matters, either on its own behalf or collectively with other parties. The litigation accrual is an estimate and is based on management’s understanding of the Company’s litigation profile, the specifics of each case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management’s best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date. 23 Table of Contents VISA INC.

Unlike the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Europe retrospective responsibility plan does not have an escrow account that is used to fund settlements or judgments. The Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through periodic adjustments to the conversion rates applicable to the UK&I preferred stock and Europe preferred stock. An accrual for the VE territory covered losses and a reduction to stockholders’ equity will be recorded when the loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable.

On April 28, 2021, a complaint was filed by Hayley Lanning, SBG Designs, LLC and others against Visa and Mastercard on behalf of a purported class of merchants located in 25 states and the District of Columbia who have taken payment using the Square card acceptance service. The complaint alleges violations of the antitrust laws of those jurisdictions and seeks recovery for plaintiffs as indirect purchasers. To the extent that Plaintiffs’ claims are not released by the Amended Settlement Agreement, Visa believes they are covered by the U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan. Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) - Individual Merchant Actions Visa has reached settlements with a number of merchants representing approximately 40 % of the Visa-branded payment card sales volume of merchants who opted out of the Amended Settlement Agreement with the Damages Class plaintiffs. VE Territory Covered Litigation Europe Merchant Litigation Since July 2013, in excess of 650 Merchants (the capitalized term “Merchant,” when used in this section, means a merchant together with subsidiary/affiliate companies that are party to the same claim) have commenced proceedings against Visa Europe, Visa Inc. and other Visa subsidiaries in the UK, Belgium and Poland primarily relating to interchange rates in Europe and in some cases relating to fees charged by Visa and certain Visa rules. As of the filing date, Visa Europe, Visa Inc. and other Visa subsidiaries have settled the claims asserted by over 100 Merchants, leaving more than 500 Merchants with outstanding claims. In addition, over 30 additional Merchants have threatened to commence similar proceedings. Standstill agreements have been entered into with respect to some of those threatened Merchant claims, several of which have been settled. With regard to the claim asserted by one Merchant, trial before the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal to determine the lawful amount, if any, the plaintiff may be entitled to recover is set for June 2022. Other plaintiffs, whose claims were stayed pending the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom's judgment, are moving their claims forward, mostly before the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal. Other Litigation Canadian Merchant Litigation All defendants have settled with the plaintiffs. The appeals by Wal-Mart Canada and/or Home Depot of Canada Inc. of the decisions approving the Visa and Mastercard settlements have been rejected in all five provinces. Wal-Mart Canada and Home Depot of Canada Inc. sought leave to appeal the British Columbia, Quebec, Ontario and Saskatchewan Courts of Appeal decisions to the Supreme Court of Canada, and those applications were denied. Wal-Mart Canada and Home Depot of Canada Inc. chose not to appeal the Alberta Court of Appeal decision to the Supreme Court of Canada, and the Visa and Mastercard settlements are now final. 25 Table of Contents VISA INC.

German ATM Litigation In December 2020 and January 2021, six savings banks and cooperative banks filed claims in Germany against Visa Europe challenging Visa’s ATM rules prohibiting the charging of access fees on domestic cash withdrawals with a credit card as anti-competitive. No damages are currently sought. On December 24, 2020, 275 German savings banks initiated conciliation proceedings against Visa Europe, Visa Europe Services, LLC., and Visa Europe Services, Inc. asserting claims related to the same rules. Visa declined participation in these proceedings on March 22, 2021. U.S. Department of Justice Civil Investigative Demand (2021) On March 26, 2021, the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the “Division”) issued a Civil Investigative Demand (“CID”) to Visa seeking documents and information regarding a potential violation of Section 1 or 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1, 2. The CID focuses on U.S. debit and competition with other payment methods and networks. Visa is cooperating with the Division in connection with the CID. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 2.

COVID-19 continues to have an impact globally. While we have been actively monitoring the worldwide spread of COVID-19, the extent to which COVID-19 continues to impact our business remains difficult to predict. Our priority remains the safety of our employees, clients and the communities in which we live and operate. We are taking a measured approach in bringing our employees back in the office, with most of our employees currently working remotely. We continue to remain in close and regular contact with our employees, clients, partners and with governments globally to help them navigate these challenging times. Revenues in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 were at varying stages of recovery. During the quarter, there was continued year-over-year growth in payments volume and processed transactions. Cross-border volume also continued to improve during the quarter, despite many borders remaining closed. Although we have taken measures to modify our business practices and reduce operating expenses, including scaling back hiring plans, restricting travel and the use of external resources, the impact that COVID-19 continues to have on our business remains difficult to predict due to numerous uncertainties, including the transmissibility, severity and duration of the outbreak, new variants of the virus, the effectiveness of social distancing measures or actions that are voluntarily adopted by the public or required by governments or public health authorities, the development, availability and rollout of effective treatments or vaccines, the timing of border openings, and the impact to our employees and our operations, the business of our clients, supplier and business partners, and other factors identified in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30 2020, filed with the SEC on November 19, 2020. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business. Highlights for the first half of fiscal 2021. Net revenues for the three and six months ended March 31, 2021 were $5.7 billion and $11.4 billion, respectively, and decreased 2% and 4% over the prior-year comparable periods, respectively. The year-over-year changes are primarily due to cross-border volume, which were impacted by the spread of COVID-19 globally starting in March 2020 and higher client incentives, partially offset by growth in nominal payments volume and processed transactions. Exchange rate movements in the three and six months ended March 31, 2021, as partially mitigated by our hedging program, positively impacted our net revenues by approximately one half of a percentage point. Total operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2021 were $2.1 billion on a GAAP basis and increased 11% over the prior-year comparable period, primarily driven by higher personnel expenses and higher general and administrative expenses, partially offset by lower marketing expenses and lower professional fees. Total operating expenses for the six months ended March 31, 2021 were $4.0 billion on a GAAP basis and increased 1% over the prior-year comparable period, primarily driven by higher personnel expenses, partially offset by lower marketing expenses, lower professional fees and lower general and administrative expenses. 28 Table of Contents Total operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2021 were $2.0 billion on a non-GAAP basis and increased 3% over the prior-year comparable period, primarily due to higher personnel expenses, partially offset by lower general and administrative expenses, lower marketing expenses and lower professional fees. Total operating expenses for the six months ended March 31, 2021 were $3.8 billion on a non-GAAP basis and decreased 3% over the prior-year comparable period, primarily driven by lower general and administrative expenses, lower marketing expenses and lower professional fees, partially offset by higher personnel expenses. Non-GAAP financial results. We use non-GAAP financial measures of our performance which exclude certain items which we believe are not representative of our continuing operations, as they may be non-recurring or have no cash impact, and may distort our longer-term operating trends. We consider non-GAAP measures useful to investors because they provide greater transparency into management’s view and assessment of our ongoing operating performance. • Gains and losses on equity investments. Gains and losses on equity investments include periodic non-cash fair value adjustments and gains and losses upon sale of an investment. These long-term investments are strategic in nature and are primarily private company investments. Gains and losses and the related tax impacts associated with these investments are tied to the performance of the companies that we invest in and therefore do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business. • Amortization of acquired intangible assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, customer relationships and brands acquired in connection with business combinations executed beginning in fiscal 2019. Amortization charges for our acquired intangible assets are non-cash and are significantly affected by the timing, frequency and size of our acquisitions, rather than our core operations. As such, we have excluded this amount and the related tax impact to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance. • Acquisition-related costs. Acquisition-related costs consist primarily of one-time transaction and integration costs associated with our business combinations. These costs include professional fees, technology integration fees, restructuring activities and other direct costs related to the purchase and integration of acquired entities. It also includes retention equity and deferred equity compensation when they are agreed upon as part of the purchase price of the transaction but are required to be recognized as expense post-combination. We have excluded these amounts and the related tax impacts as the expenses are recognized for a limited duration and do not reflect the underlying performance of our business. • Indirect taxes. During the three and six months ended March 31, 2021, we recognized a one-time charge within general and administrative expense of $152 million, before tax. Net of the related income tax benefit of $40 million, determined by applying applicable tax rates, non-GAAP net income increased by $112 million. This charge is to record our estimate of probable additional indirect taxes, related to prior periods, for which we could be liable as a result of certain changes in applicable law. This one-time charge is not representative of our ongoing operations. Non-GAAP operating expense, non-operating income (expense), income tax provision, effective income tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share should not be relied upon as substitutes for, or considered in isolation from, measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following tables reconcile our as-reported financial measures, calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to our respective non-GAAP financial measures for the three and six months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020.

Effective income tax rate, diluted earnings per share and their respective totals are calculated based on unrounded numbers. Common stock repurchases. In January 2021, our board of directors authorized an additional $8.0 billion share repurchase program. During the three months ended March 31, 2021, we repurchased 8 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market for $1.7 billion. As of March 31, 2021, our repurchase programs had remaining authorized funds of $10.0 billion. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Payments volume and processed transactions. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues. Nominal payments volume growth in the U.S. for the three and six months ended December 31, 2020 (1) was 8% for both periods, driven mainly by consumer debit. On a constant-dollar basis, which excludes the impact of exchange rate movements, our international payments volume growth for the three and six months ended December 31, 2020 was 2% for both periods. Growth in processed transactions reflects the ongoing worldwide shift to electronic payments, partially offset by the impact of COVID-19. 30 Table of Contents The following table presents nominal payments and cash volume: U.S. International Visa Inc.

Therefore, service revenues reported for the three and six months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, were based on nominal payments volume reported by our financial institution clients for the three and six months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. (2) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes and totals are calculated based on unrounded numbers. (3) Includes consumer prepaid volume and Interlink volume. (4) Includes large, medium and small business credit and debit, as well as commercial prepaid volume. (5) Total nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume. Total nominal payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased on cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink and V PAY brands. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution clients, subject to review by Visa. On occasion, previously presented volume information may be updated. Prior-period updates are not material. (6) Growth on a constant-dollar basis excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar. 31 Table of Contents The following table provides the number of transactions involving cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink, V PAY and PLUS cards processed on Visa’s networks during the periods presented: Three Months Ended March 31, Six Months Ended March 31, 2021 2020 % Change (1) 2021 2020 % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Visa processed transactions 37,644 34,941 8 % 76,857 72,716 6 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

Results of Operations Net Revenues The following table sets forth our net revenues earned in the U.S. and internationally: Three Months Ended March 31, Six Months Ended March 31, 2021 2020 $ Change % Change (1) 2021 2020 $ Change % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) U.S. $ 2,683 $ 2,650 $ 33 1 % $ 5,350 $ 5,367 $ (17) — % International 3,046 3,204 (158) (5) % 6,066 6,541 (475) (7) % Net revenues $ 5,729 $ 5,854 $ (125) (2) % $ 11,416 $ 11,908 $ (492) (4) % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. Net revenues decreased during the three and six-month comparable periods primarily due to the year-over-year changes in cross-border volume, which were impacted by COVID-19 starting in March 2020 and higher client incentives. The decrease in net revenues was partially offset by growth in nominal payments volume and processed transactions. Our net revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. Exchange rate movements in the three and six months ended March 31, 2021, as partially mitigated by our hedging program, positively impacted our net revenues by approximately one half of a percentage point. The following table sets forth the components of our net revenues: Three Months Ended March 31, Six Months Ended March 31, 2021 2020 $ Change % Change (1) 2021 2020 $ Change % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Service revenues $ 2,845 $ 2,623 $ 222 8 % $ 5,522 $ 5,178 $ 344 7 % Data processing revenues 2,996 2,711 285 11 % 6,029 5,575 454 8 % International transaction revenues 1,488 1,833 (345) (19) % 2,939 3,851 (912) (24) % Other revenues 392 392 — — % 776 757 19 2 % Client incentives (1,992) (1,705) (287) 17 % (3,850) (3,453) (397) 11 % Net revenues $ 5,729 $ 5,854 $ (125) (2) % $ 11,416 $ 11,908 $ (492) (4) % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. • Service revenues increased primarily due to 5% and 4% growth in nominal payments volume during the three and six-month comparable periods, respectively. Service revenues were also impacted by select pricing modifications and business mix. 32 Table of Contents • Data processing revenues increased mainly due to overall growth in processed transactions of 8% and 6% during the three and six-month comparable periods, respectively, growth in value added services and business mix. • International transaction revenues driven by nominal cross-border volumes, excluding transactions within Europe, declined 19% and 26% during the three and six-month comparable periods, respectively, as COVID-19 spread globally starting in March 2020. International transaction revenues were also impacted by fluctuations in the volatility of a broad range of currencies and business mix. • Client incentives increased in correlation with the increase in payments volumes during the three and six-month comparable periods. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or execution of new contracts. Operating Expenses The following table sets forth components of our total operating expenses: Three Months Ended March 31, Six Months Ended March 31, 2021 2020 $ Change % Change (1) 2021 2020 $ Change % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Personnel $ 1,114 $ 940 $ 174 18 % $ 2,095 $ 1,922 $ 173 9 % Marketing 206 235 (29) (12) % 411 509 (98) (19) % Network and processing 179 183 (4) (2) % 352 364 (12) (3) % Professional fees 82 103 (21) (21) % 165 209 (44) (21) % Depreciation and amortization 201 192 9 5 % 398 374 24 7 % General and administrative 363 269 94 35 % 566 582 (16) (3) % Litigation provision 3 8 (5) (66) % 4 8 (4) (55) % Total operating expenses $ 2,148 $ 1,930 $ 218 11 % $ 3,991 $ 3,968 $ 23 1 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. • Personnel expenses increased primarily due to increases in headcount and higher incentive compensation, reflecting our strategy to invest in future growth. • Marketing expenses decreased primarily due to delays in spending to later in fiscal 2021. • Professional fees decreased reflecting non-recurring expenses in the prior year and delays in spending to later in fiscal 2021. • Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additional depreciation and amortization from our on-going investments, including acquisitions. • General and administrative expenses increased in the three months ended March 31, 2021, as a result of a one-time charge to record our estimate of probable additional indirect taxes, related to prior periods, for which we could be liable as a result of certain changes in applicable law, partially offset by lower travel expenses and lower usage of travel related product benefits. In the six months ended March 31, 2021, expenses decreased due to lower travel expenses and lower usage of travel related product benefits, partially offset by the one-time charge of indirect taxes. 33 Table of Contents Non-operating Income (Expense) The following table sets forth the components of our non-operating income (expense): Three Months Ended March 31, Six Months Ended March 31, 2021 2020 $ Change % Change (1) 2021 2020 $ Change % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Interest expense, net $ (121) $ (118) $ (3) 3 % $ (257) $ (229) $ (28) 12 % Investment income and other 168 23 145 650 % 208 92 116 128 % Total non-operating income (expense) $ 47 $ (95) $ 142 (150) % $ (49) $ (137) $ 88 (65) % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. • Interest expense, net increased in the three and six months ended March 31, 2021 primarily as a result of the issuance of debt in fiscal 2020, offset by a discrete tax benefit recognized during the three months ended March 31, 2021. • Investment income and other increased in the three and six months ended March 31, 2021 primarily due to higher gains on our equity investments, offset by lower interest income on our cash and investments. Effective Income Tax Rate The following table sets forth our effective income tax rate: Three Months Ended March 31, Six Months Ended March 31, 2021 2020 % Change 2021 2020 % Change Effective income tax rate 17 % 19 % (2) % 17 % 19 % (2) % The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to $66 million and $147 million of tax benefits recognized during the three and six months ended March 31, 2021, respectively, as a result of the conclusion of audits by taxing authorities. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Data The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the periods presented: Six Months Ended March 31, 2021 2020 (in millions) Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 6,842 $ 5,342 Investing activities 1,474 2,441 Financing activities (7,945) (5,887) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents 16 88 Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents $ 387 $ 1,984 Operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended March 31, 2021 was higher than the prior-year comparable period primarily due to lower client incentive payments and the timing and impact of COVID-19 on settlement in the prior-year period. 34 Table of Contents Investing activities. Cash provided by investing activities for the six months ended March 31, 2021 decreased primarily due to higher purchases of investment securities, partially offset by higher sales and maturities of investment securities as compared to the prior-year period. Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities for the six months ended March 31, 2021 was higher than the prior-year comparable period primarily due to the $3.0 billion principal debt payment upon maturity of our senior notes in December 2020 and the absence of the $1.0 billion commercial paper issued in the prior year, partially offset by lower share repurchases. See Note 7—Debt and Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements . Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings and the returns that these holdings provide. Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our current and projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances. Uses of Liquidity There has been no significant change to our primary uses of liquidity since September 30, 2020, except as discussed below. Common stock repurchases. During the six months ended March 31, 2021, we repurchased 17 million shares of our class A common stock for $3.5 billion. As of March 31, 2021, our repurchase programs had remaining authorized funds of $10.0 billion. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Dividends . During the six months ended March 31, 2021, we declared and paid $1.4 billion in dividends to holders of our common and preferred stock. On April 23, 2021, our board of directors declared a cash dividend in the amount of $0.32 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and series A, UK&I and Europe preferred stock on an as-converted basis), which will be paid on June 1, 2021, to all holders of record as of May 14, 2021. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. All preferred and class B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends. Senior notes . During the six months ended March 31, 2021, we repaid $3.0 billion of principal upon maturity of our senior notes due December 14, 2020. See Note 7—Debt to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Board Update (“ASU”) 2019-12, which simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in the existing guidance for income taxes and making other minor improvements. The amendments in the ASU are effective on October 1, 2021. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01, which clarifies that an entity should consider observable transactions that require it to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting for the purposes of applying the fair value measurement alternative. The amendments in the ASU are effective on October 1, 2021. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. Subsequently, the FASB also issued an amendment to this standard. The amendments in the ASU are effective upon issuance through December 31, 2022. We are evaluating the effect ASU 2020-04 and its subsequent amendment will have on our consolidated financial statements. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 3.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Organization. Visa Inc. (“Visa” or the “Company”) is a global payments technology company that enables innovative, secure and reliable electronic payments across more than 200 countries and territories. Visa and its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries, including Visa U.S.A. Inc. (“Visa U.S.A.”), Visa International Service Association (“Visa International”), Visa Worldwide Pte. Limited, Visa Europe Limited (“Visa Europe”), Visa Canada Corporation (“Visa Canada”), Visa Technology & Operations LLC and CyberSource Corporation, operate one of the world’s largest electronic payments network — VisaNet — which facilitates authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and enables the Company to provide its financial institution and seller clients a wide range of products, platforms and value added services. Visa is not a financial institution and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders of Visa products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, Visa’s financial institution clients. Consolidation and basis of presentation. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The Company consolidates its majority-owned and controlled entities, including variable interest entities (“VIEs”) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company’s investments in VIEs have not been material to its unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) requirements for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and, consequently, do not include all of the annual disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. Reference should be made to the Visa Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2020 for additional disclosures, including a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. Use of estimates. The preparation of the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained, and will be recognized in the unaudited consolidated financial statements in the period in which such changes occur. Future actual results could differ materially from these estimates. The worldwide spread of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) has created significant uncertainty in the global economy. There have been no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect COVID-19 as a global pandemic may have, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 and the extent to which COVID-19 continues to impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements In June 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Board Update (“ASU”) 2016-13, which requires the measurement and recognition of expected credit losses for financial assets and certain other instruments held at amortized cost. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2020 using the modified retrospective transition method with comparative periods continuing to be reported using the previous applicable guidance. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In accordance with ASU 2016-13, the Company uses a forward-looking expected credit loss model for financial instruments measured at amortized cost. For available-for-sale debt securities, when credit loss indicators exist and a discounted cash flow approach results in a credit loss, the credit loss will be recorded through an allowance rather 10 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) than through an other-than-temporary impairment. In addition to recording the fair value of its settlement indemnification liability, under the new standard, the Company estimates expected credit losses and recognizes an allowance for those credit losses related to its settlement indemnification obligations. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, which simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairments by eliminating Step 2 from the goodwill impairment test. Under the amendments in ASU 2017-04, an entity should perform its annual, or interim, goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount, which is Step 1 of the goodwill impairment test. An impairment charge should be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2020. The adoption had no impact on the consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, which modifies the disclosure requirements for fair value measurements by removing, modifying or adding certain disclosures. The Company adopted this standard effective October 1, 2020. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Note 2—Acquisitions Terminated Acquisition. On January 12, 2021, Visa and Plaid Inc. mutually terminated their merger agreement announced on January 13, 2020. See Note 13—Legal Matters . Note 3—Revenues The nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of the Company’s revenues and cash flows and how they are affected by economic factors are most appropriately depicted through the Company’s revenue categories and geographical markets. The following tables disaggregate the Company’s net revenues by revenue category and by geography for the three months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019: Three Months Ended December 31, 2020 2019 (in millions) Service revenues $ 2,677 $ 2,555 Data processing revenues 3,033 2,864 International transaction revenues 1,451 2,018 Other revenues 384 365 Client incentives ( 1,858 ) ( 1,748 ) Net revenues $ 5,687 $ 6,054 Three Months Ended December 31, 2020 2019 (in millions) U.S. $ 2,667 $ 2,717 International 3,020 3,337 Net revenues $ 5,687 $ 6,054 At December 31, 2020 and September 30, 2020, deferred revenue included in accrued liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets was $ 668 million and $ 533 million, respectively. Note 4—Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents The Company’s cash and cash equivalents include cash and certain highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are primarily recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their generally short maturities. The Company defines restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents as cash and cash equivalents that cannot be withdrawn or used for general operating activities. 11 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) The Company reconciles cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents reported in the consolidated balance sheets that aggregate to the beginning and ending balances shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows as follows: December 31, 2020 September 30, 2020 (in millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 15,032 $ 16,289 Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents: U.S. litigation escrow 894 901 Customer collateral 1,993 1,850 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 136 131 Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents $ 18,055 $ 19,171 Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan Under the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Company maintains an escrow account from which settlements of, or judgments in, certain litigation referred to as the “U.S. covered litigation” are paid. The escrow funds are held in money market investments along with interest income earned, less applicable taxes, and are classified as restricted cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets. The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the U.S. litigation escrow account balance. See Note 13—Legal Matters . The following table sets forth the changes in the restricted cash equivalents—U.S. litigation escrow account: Three Months Ended December 31, 2020 2019 (in millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 901 $ 1,205 Return of takedown payment to the litigation escrow account — 467 Payments to opt-out merchants (1) and interest earned on escrow funds ( 7 ) ( 38 ) Balance at end of period $ 894 $ 1,634 (1) These payments are associated with the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation. See Note 13—Legal Matters . Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plan Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rates in the Visa Europe territory (the “VE territory covered litigation”). Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover certain losses resulting from VE territory covered litigation (the “VE territory covered losses”) through a periodic adjustment to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the UK&I and Europe preferred stock. VE territory covered losses are recorded in “right to recover for covered losses” within equity before the corresponding adjustment to the applicable conversion rate is effected. Adjustments to the conversion rate may be executed once in any six-month period unless a single, individual loss greater than € 20 million is incurred, in which case, the six-month limitation does not apply. When the adjustment to the conversion rate is made, the amount previously recorded in “right to recover for covered losses” as contra-equity is then recorded against the book value of the preferred stock within stockholders’ equity. During the three months ended December 31, 2020, the Company recovered $ 15 million of VE territory covered losses through adjustments to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the UK&I and Europe preferred stock. 12 Table of Contents VISA INC.

Money market funds, marketable equity securities and U.S. Treasury securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. The Company’s deferred compensation liability is measured at fair value based on marketable equity securities held under the deferred compensation plan. Level 2 assets and liabilities. The fair value of U.S. government-sponsored debt securities, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. Derivative instruments are valued using inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and U.S. Treasury securities. As of December 31, 2020 and September 30, 2020, the Company held $ 3.0 billion and $ 3.8 billion of these investment securities, respectively. All of the Company’s long-term available-for-sale investment securities are due within one to five years . Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis Non-marketable equity securities. The Company’s non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. These investments are classified as Level 3 due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and the fact that inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require management’s judgment. 14 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) During the three months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, upward adjustments of $ 14 million and $ 9 million, respectively, were included in the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities accounted for under the fair value measurement alternative. The three months ended December 31, 2020 also included downward adjustments of $ 2 million. During the three months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, there was no impairment recognized. The following table summarizes the total carrying value of the Company’s non-marketable equity securities held as of December 31, 2020 including cumulative unrealized gains and losses: December 31, 2020 (in millions) Initial cost basis $ 849 Adjustments: Upward adjustments 226 Downward adjustments (including impairment) ( 13 ) Carrying amount, end of period $ 1,062 Non-financial assets and liabilities. Long-lived assets such as goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, finite-lived intangible assets and property, equipment and technology are considered non-financial assets. The Company does not have any non-financial liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships and trade names, all of which were obtained through acquisitions. If the Company were required to perform a quantitative assessment for impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair values would generally be estimated using an income approach. As the assumptions employed to measure these assets on a non-recurring basis are based on management’s judgment using internal and external data, these fair value determinations are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company completed its annual impairment review of its indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill as of February 1, 2020, and concluded that there was no impairment. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed at December 31, 2020. Other Fair Value Disclosures Debt. Debt instruments are measured at amortized cost on the Company’s unaudited consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the debt instruments, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. As of December 31, 2020, the carrying value and estimated fair value of debt was $ 21.1 billion and $ 23.8 billion, respectively. As of September 30, 2020, the carrying value and estimated fair value of debt was $ 24.1 billion and $ 26.6 billion, respectively. Other financial instruments not measured at fair value. The following financial instruments are not measured at fair value on the Company’s unaudited consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2020, but disclosure of their fair values is required: settlement receivable and payable and customer collateral. The estimated fair value of such instruments at December 31, 2020 approximates their carrying value due to their generally short maturities. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 15 Table of Contents VISA INC.

Senior Notes During the three months ended December 31, 2020, the Company repaid $ 3.0 billion of principal upon maturity of its senior notes due December 14, 2020. Note 8—Settlement Guarantee Management The Company indemnifies its clients for settlement losses suffered due to failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa operating rules. This indemnification creates settlement risk for the Company due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. Historically, the Company has experienced minimal losses as a result of its settlement risk guarantee. However, the Company’s future obligations, which could be material under its guarantees, are not determinable as they are dependent upon future events. The Company’s settlement exposure is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time, which vary significantly day to day. During the three months ended December 31, 2020, the Company’s maximum daily settlement exposure was $ 97.5 billion and the average daily settlement exposure was $ 61.2 billion. 16 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) The Company maintains and regularly reviews global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement exposure, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. At December 31, 2020 and September 30, 2020, the Company held the following collateral to manage settlement exposure: December 31, 2020 September 30, 2020 (in millions) Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents $ 1,993 $ 1,850 Pledged securities at market value 282 228 Letters of credit 1,377 1,306 Guarantees 714 717 Total $ 4,366 $ 4,101 Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity As-converted class A common stock.

(4) The class B to class A common stock conversion rate is presented on a rounded basis. Conversion calculations for dividend payments are based on a conversion rate rounded to the tenth decimal. Reduction in as-converted shares. Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through periodic adjustments to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the UK&I and Europe preferred stock. The recovery has the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Company’s class A common stock, because it reduces the UK&I and Europe preferred stock conversion rates and consequently, reduces the as-converted class A common stock share count. 17 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) The following table presents the reduction in as-converted UK&I and Europe preferred stock after the Company recovered VE territory covered losses through conversion rate adjustments in the three months ended December 31, 2020. There were no conversion rate adjustments in the three months ended December 31, 2019. Three Months Ended December 31, 2020 UK&I Europe (in millions, except per share data) Reduction in equivalent number of as-converted shares of class A common stock — (1) — (1) Effective price per share (2) $ 209.89 $ 209.89 Recovery through conversion rate adjustment $ 9 $ 6 (1) The reduction in equivalent number of shares of class A common stock was less than one million shares. (2) Effective price per share for the quarter is calculated using the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s class A common stock over a pricing period in accordance with the Company’s current certificates of designations for its series B and C convertible participating preferred stock. Effective price per share is calculated using the weighted-average effective prices of the respective adjustments made during the year. Common stock repurchases. The following table presents share repurchases in the open market for the following periods: Three Months Ended December 31, 2020 2019 (in millions, except per share data) Shares repurchased in the open market (1) 9 13 Average repurchase price per share (2) $ 201.73 $ 179.27 Total cost (2) $ 1,796 $ 2,370 (1) Shares repurchased in the open market reflect repurchases that settled during the three months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. All shares repurchased in the open market have been retired and constitute authorized but unissued shares. (2) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Average repurchase price per share and total cost is calculated based on unrounded numbers. In January 2020, the Company’s board of directors authorized a $ 9.5 billion share repurchase program (the “January 2020 Program”) and in January 2021, authorized an additional $ 8.0 billion share purchase program. These authorizations have no expiration date. As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s January 2020 Program had remaining authorized funds of $ 3.7 billion. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to January 2020 have been completed. Dividends. O n January 26, 2021, the Company’s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $ 0.32 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and series A, UK&I and Europe preferred stock on an as-converted basis), which will be paid on March 1, 2021, to all holders of record as of February 12, 2021. During the three months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company declared and paid dividends of $ 703 million and $ 671 million, respectively. Note 10—Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to each class of shares by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding and participating securities during the period. Net income is allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities based on its proportional ownership on an as-converted basis. The weighted-average number of shares outstanding of each class of common stock reflects changes in ownership over the periods presented. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity . 18 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding, participating securities and, if dilutive, potential class A common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive class A common stock equivalents may consist of: (1) shares of class A common stock issuable upon the conversion of series A, UK&I and Europe preferred stock and class B and C common stock based on the conversion rates in effect through the period, and (2) incremental shares of class A common stock calculated by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of employee stock options, the assumed purchase of stock under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the assumed vesting of unearned performance shares. The following table presents earnings per share for the three months ended December 31, 2020: Basic Earnings Per Share Diluted Earnings Per Share Income Allocation (A) (1) Weighted- Average Shares Outstanding (B) Earnings per Share = (A)/(B) (2) Income Allocation (A) (1) Weighted- Average Shares Outstanding (B) Earnings per Share = (A)/(B) (2) (in millions, except per share data) Class A common stock $ 2,410 1,694 $ 1.42 $ 3,126 2,200 (3) $ 1.42 Class B common stock 567 245 $ 2.31 $ 566 245 $ 2.31 Class C common stock 61 11 $ 5.69 $ 61 11 $ 5.68 Participating securities (4) 88 Not presented Not presented $ 89 Not presented Not presented Net income $ 3,126 The following table presents earnings per share for the three months ended December 31, 2019: Basic Earnings Per Share Diluted Earnings Per Share Income Allocation (A) (1) Weighted- Average Shares Outstanding (B) Earnings per Share = (A)/(B) (2) Income Allocation (A) (1) Weighted- Average Shares Outstanding (B) Earnings per Share = (A)/(B) (2) (in millions, except per share data) Class A common stock $ 2,506 1,713 $ 1.46 $ 3,272 2,240 (3) $ 1.46 Class B common stock 583 245 $ 2.37 $ 582 245 $ 2.37 Class C common stock 65 11 $ 5.85 $ 65 11 $ 5.84 Participating securities (4) 118 Not presented Not presented $ 117 Not presented Not presented Net income $ 3,272 (1) Net income is allocated based on proportional ownership on an as-converted basis. The weighted-average number of shares of as-converted class B common stock used in the income allocation was 398 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. The weighted-average number of shares of as-converted class C common stock used in the income allocation was 43 million and 44 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The weighted-average number of shares of preferred stock included within participating securities was 21 million of as-converted series A preferred stock for the three months ended December 31, 2020, 16 million and 32 million of as-converted UK&I preferred stock for the three months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and 22 million and 44 million of as-converted Europe preferred stock for the three months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. (2) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Earnings per share is calculated based on unrounded numbers. (3) Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding are calculated on an as-converted basis and include incremental common stock equivalents, as calculated under the treasury stock method. The computation includes common stock equivalents of 3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, because their effect would have been dilutive. The computation excludes common stock equivalents of 1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. (4) Participating securities include preferred stock outstanding and unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, such as the Company’s series A preferred stock, UK&I and Europe preferred stock and restricted stock units. Participating securities’ income is allocated based on the weighted-average number of shares of as-converted stock. 19 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) Note 11—Share-based Compensation The Company granted the following equity awards to employees and non-employee directors under the 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan, or the EIP, during the three months ended December 31, 2020: Granted Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Weighted-Average Exercise Price Non-qualified stock options 1,022,430 $ 39.51 $ 207.57 Restricted stock units 2,108,933 $ 207.52 Performance-based shares (1) 432,714 $ 229.81 (1) Represents the maximum number of performance-based shares which could be earned. For the three months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recorded share-based compensation cost related to the EIP of $ 116 million and $ 111 million, respectively, net of estimated forfeitures. On January 26, 2021, the EIP was amended to extend the termination date from January 31, 2022 to January 26, 2031 and reduce the number of shares authorized for grant from 236 million to 198 million. Additionally, shares available for grant may be either unissued or previously issued shares subsequently acquired by the Company, except that shares withheld for taxes, or shares used to pay the exercise or purchase price of an award, shall not again be available for future grant. Note 12—Income Taxes For the three months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the effective income tax rates were 17 % and 18 %, respectively. The difference in the effective tax rates between the three-month periods was primarily due to an $ 81 million tax benefit recognized during the three months ended December 31, 2020 as a result of the conclusion of audits by taxing authorities. During the three months ended December 31, 2020, the Company’s gross and net unrecognized tax benefits decreased by $ 6 million and $ 49 million, respectively. The decrease in unrecognized tax benefits is primarily due to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits as a result of the conclusion of audits by taxing authorities, partially offset by increases in gross timing differences as well as various tax positions across several jurisdictions. During the three months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no significant changes in accrued interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. The Company’s tax filings are subject to examination by U.S. federal, state and foreign taxing authorities. The timing and outcome of the final resolutions of the various ongoing income tax examinations are highly uncertain. It is not reasonably possible to estimate the increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. In September 2020, the Company accepted a settlement offer related to the examination of Canadian tax returns dating back to fiscal 2003, which was subject to approval by the Tax Court of Canada. On January 21, 2021, the Tax Court of Canada approved the settlement agreement related to the examination. The Company’s income tax provision was already adjusted to reflect the estimated impact of the settlement in fiscal 2020. Note 13—Legal Matters The Company is party to various legal and regulatory proceedings. Some of these proceedings involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. Accordingly, except as disclosed, the Company has not established reserves or ranges of possible loss related to these proceedings, as at this time in the proceedings, the matters do not relate to a probable loss and/or the amount or range of losses are not reasonably estimable. Although the Company believes that it has strong defenses for the litigation and regulatory proceedings described below, it could, in the future, incur judgments or fines or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. From time to time, the Company may engage in settlement discussions or mediations with respect to one or more of its outstanding litigation matters, either on its own behalf or collectively with other parties. 20 Table of Contents VISA INC.

Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) - Individual Merchant Actions Visa has reached settlements with a number of merchants representing approximately 40 % of the Visa-branded payment card sales volume of merchants who opted out of the Amended Settlement Agreement with the Damages Class plaintiffs. VE Territory Covered Litigation Europe Merchant Litigation Since July 2013, in excess of 650 Merchants (the capitalized term “Merchant,” when used in this section, means a merchant together with subsidiary/affiliate companies that are party to the same claim) have commenced proceedings against Visa Europe, Visa Inc. and other Visa subsidiaries in the UK, Germany, Belgium and Poland primarily relating to interchange rates in Europe and in some cases relating to fees charged by Visa and certain Visa rules. As of the filing date, Visa Europe, Visa Inc. and other Visa subsidiaries have settled the claims asserted by over 100 Merchants, leaving more than 500 Merchants with outstanding claims. In addition, over 30 additional Merchants have threatened to commence similar proceedings. Standstill agreements have been entered into with respect to some of those threatened Merchant claims, several of which have been settled. With regard to the claim asserted by one Merchant, trial before the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal to determine the lawful amount, if any, the plaintiff may be entitled to recover is set for June 2022. Other plaintiffs, whose claims were stayed pending the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom's judgment, are moving their claims forward, mostly before the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal. Other Litigation EMV Chip Liability Shift On January 19, 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit denied defendants’ request to appeal the district court’s decision granting plaintiffs’ motion for class certification.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This management’s discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition and the liquidity and capital resources of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Visa,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company”) on a historical basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings, as well as those factors that may affect future earnings. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in Item 1—Financial Statements of this report. Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that relate to, among other things, the impact on our future financial position, results of operations and cash flows as a result of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”); prospects, developments, strategies and growth of our business; anticipated expansion of our products in certain countries; industry developments; anticipated benefits of our acquisitions; expectations regarding litigation matters, investigations and proceedings; timing and amount of stock repurchases; sufficiency of sources of liquidity and funding; effectiveness of our risk management programs; and expectations regarding the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements.

Our as-reported U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share are as follows: Three Months Ended December 31, 2020 2019 % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages and per share data) Net income, as reported $ 3,126 $ 3,272 (4) % Diluted earnings per share, as reported $ 1.42 $ 1.46 (3) % Non-GAAP net income (2) $ 3,125 $ 3,272 (4) % Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (2) $ 1.42 $ 1.46 (3) % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. (2) For a full reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial results, see tables in Non-GAAP financial results below. Coronavirus. COVID-19 continues to have an impact globally. While we have been actively monitoring the worldwide spread of COVID-19, the extent to which COVID-19 will ultimately impact our business remains difficult to predict. Our priority remains the safety of our employees, clients and the communities in which we live and operate. We are taking a measured approach in bringing our employees back in the office, with most of our employees currently working remotely. We continue to remain in close and regular contact with our employees, clients, partners and with governments globally to help them navigate these challenging times. Revenues in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 were at varying stages of recovery. During the quarter, there was year-over-year growth in payments volume and processed transactions. While cross-border volume did improve during the quarter, it remains depressed as the majority of borders remain closed. Although we have taken measures to modify our business practices and reduce operating expenses, including scaling back hiring plans, restricting travel, lowering marketing spend and the use of external resources, the impact that COVID-19 will have on our business remains difficult to predict due to numerous uncertainties, including the transmissibility, severity and duration of the outbreak, the effectiveness of social distancing measures or actions that are voluntarily adopted by the public or required by governments or public health authorities, the development and availability of effective treatments or vaccines, and the impact to our employees and our operations, the business of our clients, supplier and business partners, and other factors identified in Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30 2020, filed with the SEC on November 19, 2020. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business. Highlights for the first quarter of fiscal 2021. Net revenues for the three months ended December 31, 2020 were $5.7 billion, and decreased 6% over the prior-year comparable period, driven by the year-over-year changes in cross-border volume, which were impacted by the spread of COVID-19 globally starting in the latter part of March 2020, and higher client incentives. The decrease in net revenues were partially offset by growth in nominal payments volume and processed transactions. Exchange rate movements in the three months ended December 31, 2020, as partially mitigated by our hedging program, positively impacted our net revenues by approximately one half of a percentage point. Total operating expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2020 were $1.8 billion, and decreased 10% over the prior-year comparable period, on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, driven by our overall cost reduction strategy. Non-GAAP financial results. We use non-GAAP financial measures of our performance which exclude certain items which we believe are not representative of our continuing operations, as they may be non-recurring or have no cash impact, and may distort our longer-term operating trends. We consider non-GAAP measures useful to 25 Table of Contents investors because they provide greater transparency into management’s view and assessment of our ongoing operating performance. • Gains and losses on equity investments. Gains and losses on equity investments include periodic non-cash fair value adjustments and gains and losses upon sale of an investment. These long-term investments are strategic in nature and are primarily private company investments. Gains and losses and the related tax impacts associated with these investments are tied to the performance of the companies that we invest in and therefore do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business. • Amortization of acquired intangible assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, customer relationships and brands acquired in connection with business combinations executed beginning in fiscal 2019. Amortization charges for our acquired intangible assets are non-cash and are significantly affected by the timing, frequency and size of our acquisitions, rather than our core operations. As such, we have excluded this amount and the related tax impact to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance. • Acquisition-related costs. Acquisition-related costs consist primarily of one-time transaction and integration costs associated with our business combinations. These costs include professional fees, technology integration fees, restructuring activities and other direct costs related to the purchase and integration of acquired entities. It also includes retention equity and deferred equity compensation when they are agreed upon as part of the purchase price of the transaction but are required to be recognized as expense post-combination. We have excluded these amounts and the related tax impacts as the expenses are recognized for a limited duration and do not reflect the underlying performance of our business. Non-GAAP operating expense, non-operating income (expense), income tax provision, effective income tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share should not be relied upon as substitutes for, or considered in isolation from, measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following tables reconcile our as-reported financial measures, calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to our respective non-GAAP financial measures for the three months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Three Months Ended December 31, 2020 Operating Expenses Non-operating Income (Expense) Income Tax Provision Effective Income Tax Rate (1) Net Income Diluted Earnings Per Share (1) (in millions, except percentages and per share data) As reported $ 1,843 $ (96) $ 622 16.6 % $ 3,126 $ 1.42 (Gains) Losses on equity investments, net — (16) (4) (12) (0.01) Amortization of acquired intangible assets (12) — 3 9 — Acquisition-related costs (3) — 1 2 — Non-GAAP $ 1,828 $ (112) $ 622 16.6 % $ 3,125 $ 1.42 Three Months Ended December 31, 2019 Operating Expenses Non-operating Income (Expense) Income Tax Provision Effective Income Tax Rate (1) Net Income Diluted Earnings Per Share (1) (in millions, except percentages and per share data) As reported $ 2,038 $ (42) $ 702 17.7 % $ 3,272 $ 1.46 (Gains) Losses on equity investments, net — (13) (3) (10) — Amortization of acquired intangible assets (11) — 3 8 — Acquisition-related costs (2) — — 2 — Non-GAAP $ 2,025 $ (55) $ 702 17.7 % $ 3,272 $ 1.46 (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

In January 2020, our board of directors authorized a $9.5 billion share repurchase program (the “January 2020 Program”). During the three months ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased 9 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market for $1.8 billion. As of December 31, 2020, our January 2020 Program had remaining authorized funds of $3.7 billion. In January 2021, our board of directors authorized an additional $8.0 billion share repurchase program. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Acquisition. On January 12, 2021, Visa and Plaid Inc. mutually terminated their merger agreement announced on January 13, 2020. See Note 2—Acquisitions and Note 13—Legal Matters to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Payments volume and processed transactions. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues. Nominal payments volume growth in the U.S. for the three months ended September 30, 2020 (1) was 7%, while nominal international payments volume growth was negatively impacted by movements in U.S. dollar exchange rates. On a constant-dollar basis, which excludes the impact of exchange rate movements, our international payments volume growth for the three months ended September 30, 2020 was 1%. Growth in processed transactions reflects the ongoing worldwide shift to electronic payments, partially offset by the impact of COVID-19. The following table presents nominal payments and cash volume: United States International Visa Inc. Three Months Ended September 30, (1) Three Months Ended September 30, (1) Three Months Ended September 30, (1) 2020 2019 % Change (2) 2020 2019 % Change (2) 2020 2019 % Change (2) (in billions, except percentages) Nominal payments volume Consumer credit $ 378 $ 405 (7) % $ 573 $ 646 (11) % $ 951 $ 1,051 (10) % Consumer debit (3) 555 446 25 % 584 501 17 % 1,140 947 20 % Commercial (4) 164 170 (4) % 94 101 (7) % 258 271 (5) % Total nominal payments volume (2) $ 1,097 $ 1,021 7 % $ 1,252 $ 1,248 — % $ 2,349 $ 2,269 4 % Cash volume 165 148 12 % 481 566 (15) % 646 714 (10) % Total nominal volume (2),(5) $ 1,262 $ 1,168 8 % $ 1,733 $ 1,814 (5) % $ 2,995 $ 2,983 — % 27 Table of Contents The following table presents nominal and constant payments and cash volume growth: International Visa Inc.

Therefore, service revenues reported for the three months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 were based on nominal payments volume reported by our financial institution clients for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. (2) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes and totals are calculated based on unrounded numbers. (3) Includes consumer prepaid volume and Interlink volume. (4) Includes large, medium and small business credit and debit, as well as commercial prepaid volume. (5) Total nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume. Total nominal payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased on cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink and V PAY brands. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution clients, subject to review by Visa. On occasion, previously presented volume information may be updated. Prior-period updates are not material. (6) Growth on a constant-dollar basis excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar. The following table provides the number of transactions involving cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink, V PAY and PLUS cards processed on Visa’s networks during the periods presented: Three Months Ended December 31, 2020 2019 % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Visa processed transactions 39,213 37,775 4 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage change is calculated based on unrounded numbers. Results of Operations Net Revenues The following table sets forth our net revenues earned in the U.S. and internationally: Three Months Ended December 31, 2020 2019 $ Change % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) U.S. $ 2,667 $ 2,717 $ (50) (2) % International 3,020 3,337 (317) (9) % Net revenues $ 5,687 $ 6,054 $ (367) (6) % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. Net revenues decreased primarily due to the year-over-year changes in cross-border volume, which were impacted by COVID-19 starting in the latter part of March 2020, and higher client incentives. The decrease in net revenues was partially offset by growth in nominal payments volume and processed transactions. 28 Table of Contents Our net revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. Exchange rate movements in the three months ended December 31, 2020, as partially mitigated by our hedging program, positively impacted our net revenues by approximately one half of a percentage point. The following table sets forth the components of our net revenues: Three Months Ended December 31, 2020 2019 $ Change % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Service revenues $ 2,677 $ 2,555 $ 122 5 % Data processing revenues 3,033 2,864 169 6 % International transaction revenues 1,451 2,018 (567) (28) % Other revenues 384 365 19 5 % Client incentives (1,858) (1,748) (110) 6 % Net revenues $ 5,687 $ 6,054 $ (367) (6) % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. • Service revenues increased primarily due to 4% growth in nominal payments volume. Service revenues were also impacted by select pricing modifications and business mix. • Data processing revenues increased mainly due to overall growth in processed transactions of 4% and growth in value added services. • International transaction revenues decreased due to a 32% decline in nominal cross-border volumes, excluding transactions within Europe, as COVID-19 spread globally starting in the latter part of March 2020. International transaction revenues were also impacted by fluctuations in the volatility of a broad range of currencies and business mix. • Other revenues increased primarily due to higher consulting and marketing related fees and other value added services revenues. • Client incentives increased in correlation with the increase in payments volumes. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or execution of new contracts. Operating Expenses The following table sets forth components of our total operating expenses: Three Months Ended December 31, 2020 2019 $ Change % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Personnel $ 981 $ 982 $ (1) — % Marketing 205 274 (69) (25) % Network and processing 173 181 (8) (4) % Professional fees 83 106 (23) (21) % Depreciation and amortization 197 182 15 8 % General and administrative 203 313 (110) (35) % Litigation provision 1 — 1 165 % Total operating expenses $ 1,843 $ 2,038 $ (195) (10) % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. 29 Table of Contents • Marketing expenses decreased reflecting our overall cost reduction strategy. • Professional fees decreased reflecting our overall cost reduction strategy. • Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additional depreciation and amortization from our on-going investments, including acquisitions. • General and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to travel restrictions, lower product enhancements costs and our overall cost reduction strategy. Non-operating Income (Expense) The following table sets forth the components of our non-operating income (expense): Three Months Ended December 31, 2020 2019 $ Change % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Interest expense, net $ (136) $ (111) $ (25) 23 % Investment income and other 40 69 (29) (43) % Total non-operating income (expense) $ (96) $ (42) $ (54) 130 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. • Interest expense, net increased primarily as a result of the issuance of debt in fiscal 2020. • Investment income and other decreased primarily due to lower interest income on our cash and investments. Effective Income Tax Rate The following table sets forth our effective income tax rate: Three Months Ended December 31, 2020 2019 Change Effective income tax rate 17 % 18 % (1) % The difference in the effective tax rates between the three months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was primarily due to an $81 million tax benefit recognized during the three months ended December 31, 2020 as a result of the conclusion of audits by taxing authorities. 30 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Data The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the periods presented: Three Months Ended December 31, 2020 2019 (in millions) Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 3,513 $ 3,875 Investing activities 639 562 Financing activities (5,572) (3,133) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents 304 127 Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents $ (1,116) $ 1,431 Operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended December 31, 2020 was lower than the prior-year comparable period due to prior-year receipt of the $467 million takedown payment associated with the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation, partially offset by lower client incentives and lower cash paid for taxes. Investing activities. Cash provided by investing activities for the three months ended December 31, 2020 increased primarily due to higher maturities and sales of investment securities, partially offset by higher purchases of investment securities as compared to the prior-year period. Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities for the three months ended December 31, 2020 was higher than the prior-year comparable period primarily due to the $3.0 billion principal debt payment upon maturity of our senior notes in December 2020 and higher dividends paid, partially offset by lower share repurchases. See Note 7—Debt and Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements . Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings and the returns that these holdings provide. Based on our current cash flow budgets and forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our current and projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances. Uses of Liquidity There has been no significant change to our primary uses of liquidity since September 30, 2020, except as discussed below. Common stock repurchases. During the three months ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased 9 million shares of our class A common stock for $1.8 billion. As of December 31, 2020, our January 2020 Program had remaining authorized funds of $3.7 billion. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. 31 Table of Contents Dividends . During the three months ended December 31, 2020, we declared and paid $703 million in dividends to holders of our common and preferred stock. On January 26, 2021, our board of directors declared a cash dividend in the amount of $0.32 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and series A, UK&I and Europe preferred stock on an as-converted basis), which will be paid on March 1, 2021, to all holders of record as of February 12, 2021. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. All preferred and class B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends. Senior notes . In December 2020, a principal payment of $3.0 billion was made on our fixed-rate senior notes issued in December 2015. See Note 7—Debt to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted In December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Board Update (“ASU”) 2019-12, which simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in the existing guidance for income taxes and making other minor improvements. The amendments in the ASU are effective on October 1, 2021. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01, which clarifies that an entity should consider observable transactions that require it to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting for the purposes of applying the fair value measurement alternative. The amendments in the ASU are effective on October 1, 2021. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. Subsequently, the FASB also issued an amendment to this standard. The amendments in the ASU are effective upon issuance through December 31, 2022. We are evaluating the effect ASU 2020-04 and its subsequent amendment will have on our consolidated financial statements. ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk There have been no significant changes to our market risks since September 30, 2020. ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) of Visa Inc. at the end of the period covered by this report and, based on such evaluation, have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures of Visa Inc. were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of such date. Changes in internal control over financial reporting.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Organization. Visa Inc. (“Visa” or the “Company”) is a global payments technology company that enables fast, secure and reliable electronic payments across more than 200 countries and territories. Visa and its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries, including Visa U.S.A. Inc. (“Visa U.S.A.”), Visa International Service Association (“Visa International”), Visa Worldwide Pte. Limited, Visa Europe Limited (“Visa Europe”), Visa Canada Corporation (“Visa Canada”), Visa Technology & Operations LLC and CyberSource Corporation, operate one of the world’s largest electronic payments networks — VisaNet — which facilitates authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and enables the Company to provide its financial institution and merchant clients a wide range of products, platforms and value-added services. Visa is not a financial institution and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders on Visa products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, Visa’s financial institution clients. Consolidation and basis of presentation. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The Company consolidates its majority-owned and controlled entities, including variable interest entities (“VIEs”) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company’s investments in VIEs have not been material to its unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) requirements for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and, consequently, do not include all of the annual disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. Reference should be made to the Visa Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2019 for additional disclosures, including a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. Use of estimates. The preparation of accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained, and will be recognized in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which such changes occur. Future actual results could differ materially from these estimates. The worldwide spread of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) has created significant uncertainty in the global economy. There have been no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect the spread of COVID-19 as a global pandemic may have, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 and the extent to which COVID-19 continues to impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict. Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities arising from operating leases on the balance sheet. Subsequently, the FASB also issued a series of amendments to this new leases standard that address the transition methods available and clarify the guidance for lessor costs and other aspects of the new leases standard. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition method with comparative periods continuing to be reported using the prior leases standard. The Company elected to apply the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, allowing the Company to carry forward the historical assessment of whether a contract was or 12 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) contains a lease, lease classification and capitalization of initial direct costs. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In accordance with ASU 2016-02, the Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at its inception. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, and corresponding lease liabilities, are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. For this purpose, the Company considers only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement. As a majority of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The ROU asset also includes any lease payments made prior to commencement and is recorded net of any lease incentives received. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options. The Company does not record a ROU asset and corresponding liability for leases with terms of 12 months or less. The Company does not include renewals in the determination of the lease term unless the renewals are deemed to be reasonably assured at lease commencement. Lease agreements generally contain lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components primarily include payments for maintenance and utilities. The Company does not combine lease payments with non-lease components for any of its leases. Operating leases are recorded as ROU assets, which are included in other assets. The current portion of lease liabilities are included in accrued liabilities and the long-term portion is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company’s lease cost consists of amounts recognized under lease agreements in the results of operations adjusted for impairment and sublease income. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, which allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for adjustments to tax effects that were originally recorded in other comprehensive income due to changes in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate resulting from the enactment of the U.S. tax reform legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Company adopted the ASU effective October 1, 2019. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, which simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in the existing guidance for income taxes and making other minor improvements. The amendments in the ASU are effective for the Company on October 1, 2021. The Company does not plan to early adopt the ASU at this time. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01, which clarifies that an entity should consider observable transactions that require it to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting for the purposes of applying the fair value measurement alternative. The amendments in the ASU are effective for the Company on October 1, 2021. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The amendments in the ASU are effective for the Company upon issuance through December 31, 2022. The Company is evaluating the effect ASU 2020-04 will have on its consolidated financial statements. Note 2—Acquisitions Pending Acquisition. On January 13, 2020, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Plaid, Inc. for $ 5.3 billion. The Company will pay approximately $ 4.9 billion of cash and $ 0.4 billion of retention equity and deferred equity consideration. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including ongoing regulatory reviews and approvals, which are expected to be completed by the end of 2020. 13 Table of Contents VISA INC.

The following tables disaggregate the Company’s net revenues by revenue category and by geography for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019: Three Months Ended June 30, Nine Months Ended June 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 (in millions) Service revenues $ 2,409 $ 2,405 $ 7,587 $ 7,164 Data processing revenues 2,525 2,662 8,100 7,564 International transaction revenues 1,102 1,977 4,953 5,624 Other revenues 314 342 1,071 968 Client incentives ( 1,513 ) ( 1,546 ) ( 4,966 ) ( 4,480 ) Net revenues $ 4,837 $ 5,840 $ 16,745 $ 16,840 Three Months Ended June 30, Nine Months Ended June 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 (in millions) U.S. $ 2,380 $ 2,587 $ 7,747 $ 7,573 International 2,457 3,253 8,998 9,267 Net revenues $ 4,837 $ 5,840 $ 16,745 $ 16,840 Note 4—Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents The Company’s cash and cash equivalents include cash and certain highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are primarily recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their generally short maturities. The Company defines restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents as cash and cash equivalents that cannot be withdrawn or used for general operating activities. The Company reconciles cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents reported in the consolidated balance sheets that aggregate to the beginning and ending balances shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows as follows: June 30, 2020 September 30, 2019 (in millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 13,898 $ 7,838 Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents: U.S. litigation escrow 1,148 1,205 Customer collateral 1,759 1,648 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 129 141 Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents $ 16,934 $ 10,832 Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan Under the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Company maintains an escrow account from which settlements of, or judgments in, certain litigation referred to as the “U.S. covered litigation” are paid. The escrow funds are held in money market investments along with interest income earned, less applicable taxes, and are classified as restricted cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets. 14 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) On December 13, 2019, the district court entered the final judgment order approving the Amended Settlement Agreement with the Damages Class plaintiffs in the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation proceedings. A takedown payment of approximately $ 467 million was received on December 27, 2019, and deposited into the Company’s litigation escrow account. The deposit into the litigation escrow account and reestablishment of a prior accrual to address opt-out claims was recorded during the nine months ended June 30, 2020. The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the litigation escrow account balance. See Note 14—Legal Matters . The following table sets forth the changes in the restricted cash equivalents—U.S. litigation escrow account: Nine Months Ended June 30, 2020 2019 (in millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 1,205 $ 1,491 Return of takedown payment to the litigation escrow account 467 — Payments to class plaintiffs’ settlement fund (1) — ( 600 ) Payments to opt-out merchants (1) and interest earned on escrow funds ( 524 ) 11 Balance at end of period $ 1,148 $ 902 (1) These payments are associated with the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation. See Note 14—Legal Matters . Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plan Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rates in the Visa Europe territory (the “VE territory covered litigation”). Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover certain losses resulting from VE territory covered litigation (the “VE territory covered losses”) through a periodic adjustment to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the UK&I and Europe preferred stock. VE territory covered losses are recorded in “right to recover for covered losses” within equity before the corresponding adjustment to the applicable conversion rate is effected. Adjustments to the conversion rate may be executed once in any six-month period unless a single, individual loss greater than € 20 million is incurred, in which case, the six-month limitation does not apply. When the adjustment to the conversion rate is made, the amount previously recorded in “right to recover for covered losses” as contra-equity is then recorded against the book value of the preferred stock within stockholders’ equity. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020, the Company recovered $ 164 million of VE territory covered losses through adjustments to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the UK&I and Europe preferred stock. The conversion rates applicable to the UK&I and Europe preferred stock were reduced from 12.936 and 13.884 , respectively, as of September 30, 2019 to 12.775 and 13.722 , respectively, as of June 30, 2020. 15 Table of Contents VISA INC.

Level 1 assets. Money market funds, marketable equity securities and U.S. Treasury securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets. The Company’s deferred compensation liability is measured at fair value based on marketable equity securities held under the deferred compensation plan. Level 2 assets and liabilities. The fair value of U.S. government-sponsored debt securities, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. The pricing data obtained from outside sources is reviewed internally for reasonableness, compared against benchmark quotes from independent pricing sources, then confirmed or revised accordingly. Derivative instruments are valued using inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. There were no substantive changes to the valuation techniques and related inputs used to measure fair value during the nine months ended June 30, 2020. U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and U.S. Treasury securities. The Company considers U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and U.S. Treasury securities to be available-for-sale and held $ 3.1 billion and $ 6.3 billion of these investment securities as of June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019, respectively. All of the Company’s long-term available-for-sale investment securities are due within one to five years . 17 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis Non-marketable equity securities. The Company’s non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. These investments are classified as Level 3 due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and the fact that inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require management’s judgment. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020, $ 56 million and $ 65 million, respectively, of upward adjustments were included in the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities. No material downward adjustments were included during the same periods. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020, $ 6 million in impairment was recognized. There was no impairment recognized during the same prior-year comparable periods. The following table summarizes the total carrying value of the Company’s non-marketable equity securities held as of June 30, 2020 including cumulative unrealized gains and losses: June 30, 2020 (in millions) Initial cost basis $ 834 Upward adjustments 175 Downward adjustments (including impairment) ( 11 ) Carrying amount, end of period $ 998 Non-financial assets and liabilities. Long-lived assets such as goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, finite-lived intangible assets and property, equipment and technology are considered non-financial assets. The Company does not have any non-financial liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships and trade names, all of which were obtained through acquisitions. If the Company were required to perform a quantitative assessment for impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair values would generally be estimated using an income approach. As the assumptions employed to measure these assets on a non-recurring basis are based on management’s judgment using internal and external data, these fair value determinations are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company completed its annual impairment review of its indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill as of February 1, 2020, and concluded that there was no impairment. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed at June 30, 2020. Gains and Losses on Marketable and Non-marketable Equity Securities Gains and losses on the Company’s equity securities are summarized below. Three Months Ended June 30, Nine Months Ended June 30, 2020 2019 2020 2019 (in millions) Net gain (loss) on equity securities sold during the period $ — $ 1 $ 5 $ 16 Unrealized gain (loss) on equity securities held as of the end of the period 68 10 59 69 Total gain (loss) recognized in non-operating income (expense), net $ 68 $ 11 $ 64 $ 85 Other Fair Value Disclosures Long-term debt. Debt instruments are measured at amortized cost on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the debt instruments, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. The pricing data obtained from outside sources is reviewed internally for reasonableness, compared against benchmark quotes from independent pricing sources, then confirmed or revised accordingly. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The carrying value and estimated fair value of long-term debt was $ 20.9 billion and $ 23.4 billion, respectively, as of June 30, 2020. The carrying value and estimated fair value of long-term debt was $ 16.7 billion and $ 18.4 billion, respectively, as of September 30, 2019. 18 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) Other financial instruments not measured at fair value. The following financial instruments are not measured at fair value on the Company’s unaudited consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2020, but disclosure of their fair values is required: settlement receivable and payable, accounts receivable and customer collateral. The estimated fair value of such instruments at June 30, 2020 approximates their carrying value due to their generally short maturities. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Note 7—Leases The Company entered into various operating lease agreements primarily for real estate. The Company's leases have original lease periods expiring between fiscal 2020 and 2030. Many leases include one or more options to renew. The Company's lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Payments under the Company’s lease arrangements are generally fixed. At June 30, 2020, the Company had no finance leases. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020, total operating lease cost was $ 29 million and $ 84 million, respectively. At June 30, 2020, the weighted average remaining lease term for operating leases was approximately 7 years and the weighted average discount rate for operating leases was 2.28 %. At June 30, 2020, the present value of future minimum lease payments was as follows: June 30, 2020 (in millions) Remainder of 2020 $ 29 2021 107 2022 100 2023 93 2024 80 Thereafter 226 Total undiscounted lease payments 635 Less: imputed interest ( 52 ) Present value of lease liabilities $ 583 At June 30, 2020, the Company had additional operating leases that had not yet commenced with lease obligations of $ 465 million.

Commercial Paper Program Visa maintains a commercial paper program to support its working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. Under the program, the Company is authorized to issue up to $ 3.0 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. During the three months ended June 30, 2020, the Company repaid $ 1.0 billion of commercial paper that was issued during the three months ended March 31, 2020. The Company had no outstanding obligations under the program at June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019. Senior Notes In April 2020, the Company issued fixed-rate senior notes in a public offering for an aggregate principal amount of $ 4.0 billion, with maturities ranging between 7 and 20 years. The April 2027 Notes, 2030 Notes and 2040 Notes, or collectively, the ""2020 Notes"", have interest rates of 1.90 %, 2.05 % and 2.70 %, respectively. Interest on the 2020 Notes is payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing October 15, 2020. The net aggregate proceeds, after deducting discounts and debt issuance costs, were approximately $ 4.0 billion. The Company plans to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes. The 2020 Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company, ranking equally with the Company's other senior unsecured indebtedness. The Company may redeem the 2020 Notes as a whole or in part at any time and from time to time at specified redemption prices. 20 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) Future principal payments on the Company’s outstanding debt are as follows: For the Years Ending September 30, 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Thereafter Total (in millions) Future principal payments $ — $ 3,000 $ 1,000 $ 2,250 $ — $ 14,500 $ 20,750 Note 9—Settlement Guarantee Management The Company indemnifies its clients for settlement losses suffered due to failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa operating rules. This indemnification creates settlement risk for the Company due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. Historically, the Company has experienced minimal losses as a result of its settlement risk guarantee. However, the Company’s future obligations, which could be material under its guarantees, are not determinable as they are dependent upon future events. The Company’s settlement exposure is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time, which vary significantly day to day. The Company’s maximum daily settlement exposure was $ 97.3 billion and the average daily settlement exposure was $ 54.4 billion during the nine months ended June 30, 2020. The Company maintains and regularly reviews global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement exposure, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. At June 30, 2020 and September 30, 2019, the Company held collateral as follows: June 30, 2020 September 30, 2019 (in millions) Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents $ 1,759 $ 1,648 Pledged securities at market value 281 259 Letters of credit 1,273 1,293 Guarantees 704 477 Total $ 4,017 $ 3,677 21 Table of Contents VISA INC.

(3) The class B to class A common stock conversion rate is presented on a rounded basis. Conversion calculations for dividend payments are based on a conversion rate rounded to the tenth decimal. Reduction in as-converted shares. Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through periodic adjustments to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the UK&I and Europe preferred stock. The recovery has the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Company’s class A common stock, because it reduces the UK&I and Europe preferred stock conversion rates and consequently, reduces the as-converted class A common stock share count. The following table presents the reduction in equivalent number of as-converted shares of class A common stock, effective price per share and recovery of VE territory covered losses through conversion rate adjustments: Nine Months Ended June 30, 2020 Nine Months Ended June 30, 2019 UK&I Europe UK&I Europe (in millions, except per share data) Reduction in equivalent number of as-converted class A common stock — (1) 1 — (1) — (1) Effective price per share (2) $ 180.00 $ 180.00 $ 141.32 $ 150.26 Recovery through conversion rate adjustment $ 72 $ 92 $ 6 $ 2 (1) The reduction in equivalent number of shares of class A common stock was less than one million shares. (2) Effective price per share for the quarter is calculated using the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s class A common stock over a pricing period in accordance with the Company’s current certificates of designations for its series B and C convertible participating preferred stock.

Average repurchase price per share and total cost is calculated based on unrounded numbers. In January 2019, the Company’s board of directors authorized an $ 8.5 billion share repurchase program and in January 2020, authorized an additional $ 9.5 billion share purchase program (the “January 2020 Program”). These authorizations have no expiration date. As of June 30, 2020, the Company’s January 2020 Program had remaining authorized funds of $ 7.0 billion for share repurchase. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to the January 2020 Program have been completed. Dividends. O n July 20, 2020, the Company’s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $ 0.30 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and UK&I and Europe preferred stock on an as-converted basis). The cash dividend will be paid on September 1, 2020, to all holders of record as of August 14, 2020. The Company declared and paid $ 663 million and $ 565 million during the three months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively and $ 2.0 billion and $ 1.7 billion during the nine months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in dividends to holders of the Company’s common and preferred stocks. Note 11—Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to each class of shares by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding and participating securities during the period. Net income is allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities based on its proportional ownership on an as-converted basis. The weighted-average number of shares outstanding of each class of common stock reflects changes in ownership over the periods presented. See Note 10—Stockholders’ Equity . Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding, participating securities and, if dilutive, potential class A common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive class A common stock equivalents may consist of: (1) shares of class A common stock issuable upon the conversion of UK&I and Europe preferred stock and class B and C common stock based on the conversion rates in effect through the period, and (2) incremental shares of class A common stock calculated by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of employee stock options, the assumed purchase of stock under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the assumed vesting of unearned performance shares. 23 Table of Contents VISA INC.

The weighted-average number of shares of preferred stock included within participating securities was 32 million of as-converted UK&I preferred stock for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, and 44 million of as-converted Europe preferred stock for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019. (2) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Earnings per share is calculated based on unrounded numbers. (3) Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding are calculated on an as-converted basis and include incremental common stock equivalents, as calculated under the treasury stock method. The computation includes common stock equivalents of 3 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, because their effect would have been dilutive. The computation excludes common stock equivalents of 1 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020, and less than 1 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. (4) Participating securities include preferred stock outstanding and unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, such as the UK&I and Europe preferred stock and restricted stock units. Participating securities’ income is allocated based on the weighted-average number of shares of as-converted stock. Note 12—Share-based Compensation The Company granted the following equity awards to employees and non-employee directors under the 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan, or the EIP, during the nine months ended June 30, 2020: Granted Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Weighted-Average Exercise Price Non-qualified stock options 1,247,982 $ 29.37 $ 182.50 Restricted stock units 2,287,483 $ 183.22 Performance-based shares (1) 470,128 $ 211.08 (1) Represents the maximum number of performance-based shares which could be earned.

Note 13—Income Taxes The effective income tax rates were 19 % for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020, and 20 % and 19 % for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, respectively. The difference in the effective tax rates between the three-month periods was primarily due to the change in geographic mix of income. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020, the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by $ 55 million and $ 230 million, respectively. The Company’s net unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably impact the effective tax rate, increased by $ 31 million and $ 70 million, respectively. The change in unrecognized tax benefits is primarily related to various tax positions across several jurisdictions. The Company’s accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions increased by $ 18 million and $ 56 million during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020, respectively, and $ 19 million and $ 51 million during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, respectively. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019, there were no significant changes in penalties related to uncertain tax positions. The Company’s tax filings are subject to examination by the U.S. federal, state and foreign taxing authorities. The timing and outcome of the final resolutions of the various ongoing income tax examinations are highly uncertain. It is not reasonably possible to estimate the increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) was enacted in the U.S. on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act includes several U.S. income tax provisions related to, among other things, net operating loss carrybacks, alternative minimum tax credits, modifications to the net interest deduction limitations, and technical amendments regarding the income tax depreciation of qualified improvement property placed in service after December 31, 2017. The CARES Act is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial results. 25 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) On July 22, 2020, UK enacted a legislation that repealed the previous tax rate reduction from 19% to 17% that was effective on April 1, 2020. The repeal of the UK tax rate reduction is not expected to significantly increase the Company’s ongoing effective tax rate, however, it will result in a one-time non-cash tax expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, due to the re-measurement of deferred taxes which are primarily related to intangibles recorded in purchase accounting upon the acquisition of Visa Europe in fiscal 2016. Note 14—Legal Matters The Company is party to various legal and regulatory proceedings. Some of these proceedings involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. Accordingly, except as disclosed, the Company has not established reserves or ranges of possible loss related to these proceedings, as at this time in the proceedings, the matters do not relate to a probable loss and/or the amount or range of losses are not reasonably estimable. Although the Company believes that it has strong defenses for the litigation and regulatory proceedings described below, it could, in the future, incur judgments or fines or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. From time to time, the Company may engage in settlement discussions or mediations with respect to one or more of its outstanding litigation matters, either on its own behalf or collectively with other parties. The litigation accrual is an estimate and is based on management’s understanding of its litigation profile, the specifics of each case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management’s best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date. The following table summarizes the activity related to accrued litigation: Nine Months Ended June 30, 2020 2019 (in millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 1,203 $ 1,434 Provision for uncovered legal matters 7 37 Provision for covered legal matters 14 165 Reestablishment of prior accrual related to interchange multidistrict litigation 467 — Payments for legal matters ( 535 ) ( 780 ) Balance at end of period $ 1,156 $ 856 Accrual Summary—U.S. Covered Litigation Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A. and Visa International are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, which the Company refers to as the U.S. covered litigation. See further discussion below under U.S. Covered Litigation and Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans. An accrual for the U.S. covered litigation and a charge to the litigation provision are recorded when a loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. In making this determination, the Company evaluates available information, including but not limited to actions taken by the litigation committee. The total accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the escrow account balance.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) In fiscal 2019, the Company paid $ 600 million from its litigation escrow account into a settlement fund established pursuant to the Amended Settlement Agreement with the Damages Class plaintiffs in the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation. Under the Amended Settlement Agreement, if class members opt out of the Damages Class, the defendants are entitled to receive takedown payments of up to $ 700 million (up to $ 467 million for Visa), based on the percentage of payment card sales volume attributable to merchants who have chosen to opt out. On December 13, 2019, the district court entered a final judgment order approving the Amended Settlement Agreement with the Damages Class plaintiffs. A takedown payment of approximately $ 467 million was received on December 27, 2019, and deposited into the Company’s litigation escrow account. The deposit into the litigation escrow account and reestablishment of a prior accrual to address opt-out claims was recorded during the nine months ended June 30, 2020. See further discussion below under U.S. Covered Litigation . Accrual Summary—VE Territory Covered Litigation Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the Europe retrospective responsibility plan. Unlike the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Europe retrospective responsibility plan does not have an escrow account that is used to fund settlements or judgments. The Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through periodic adjustments to the conversion rates applicable to the UK&I preferred stock and Europe preferred stock. An accrual for the VE territory covered losses and a reduction to stockholders’ equity will be recorded when the loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. See further discussion below under VE Territory Covered Litigation and Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . The following table summarizes the accrual activity related to VE territory covered litigation: Nine Months Ended June 30, 2020 2019 (in millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 5 $ — Provision for VE territory covered litigation 14 165 Payments for VE territory covered litigation ( 5 ) ( 156 ) Balance at end of period $ 14 $ 9 U.S. Covered Litigation Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) – Putative Class Actions On November 20, 2019, the district court denied the bank defendants’ motion to dismiss the claims brought against them by the putative Injunctive Relief Class. On December 13, 2019, the district court granted final approval of the Amended Settlement Agreement relating to claims by the Damages Class, which was subsequently appealed. On May 29, 2020, a complaint was filed by Old Jericho Enterprise, Inc. against Visa and Mastercard on behalf of a purported class of gasoline retailers operating in 24 states and the District of Columbia. The complaint alleges violations of the antitrust laws of those jurisdictions and seeks recovery for plaintiffs as indirect purchasers. Visa believes Plaintiffs’ claims are released by the Amended Settlement Agreement and are, nevertheless, covered by the U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan. On June 1, 2020, Visa, jointly with other defendants, served a motion for summary judgment regarding the claims in the Injunctive Relief Class complaint. The putative Injunctive Relief Class plaintiffs served a motion for partial summary judgment. Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) - Individual Merchant Actions Visa has reached settlements with a number of merchants representing approximately 30 % of the Visa-branded payment card sales volume of merchants who opted out of the Amended Settlement Agreement with the Damages Class plaintiffs. 27 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) On June 1, 2020, Visa, jointly with other defendants, served motions for summary judgment regarding the claims in certain of the individual merchant actions, as well as certain declaratory judgment claims brought by Visa, Mastercard, and some U.S. financial institutions. Plaintiffs in certain of the individual merchant actions served motions for partial summary judgment. VE Territory Covered Litigation Europe Merchant Litigation Since July 2013, in excess of 500 Merchants (the capitalized term “Merchant,” when used in this section, means a merchant together with subsidiary/affiliate companies that are party to the same claim) have commenced proceedings against Visa Europe, Visa Inc. and other Visa subsidiaries in the UK, Germany, Belgium and Poland primarily relating to interchange rates in Europe and in some cases relating to fees charged by Visa and certain Visa rules. As of the filing date, Visa Europe, Visa Inc. and other Visa subsidiaries have settled the claims asserted by over 100 Merchants, leaving more than 400 Merchants with outstanding claims. In addition, over 30 additional Merchants have threatened to commence similar proceedings. Standstill agreements have been entered into with respect to some of those threatened Merchant claims, several of which have been settled. On June 17, 2020, the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom found that Visa’s UK domestic interchange restricted competition. The case will now continue before the UK Competition Appeals Tribunal to determine the lawful level of interchange and the amount the plaintiff may be entitled to recover. Other Litigation Canadian Merchant Litigation Between August 2019 and January 2020, the Courts of Appeal in British Columbia, Quebec, Ontario and Saskatchewan rejected the appeals filed by Wal-Mart Canada and Home Depot of Canada Inc. In January 2020, Wal-Mart Canada and Home Depot of Canada Inc. filed applications to appeal the decisions of the British Columbia, Quebec and Ontario courts to the Supreme Court of Canada and those applications were denied on March 26, 2020. Wal-Mart Canada and Home Depot of Canada Inc. also filed an application seeking the Supreme Court’s review of the Saskatchewan court's decision.

COVID-19 continues to have an impact globally. While we have been actively monitoring the worldwide spread of COVID-19, the extent to which COVID-19 will ultimately impact our business remains difficult to predict. Our priority remains the safety of our employees, clients and the communities in which we live and operate. We are taking a measured approach in bringing our employees back in the office and will continue to have most of our employees work remotely for the rest of 2020. We continue to remain in close and regular contact with our employees, clients, partners and governments globally to help them navigate these challenging times. Revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 were impacted by declines in volumes and transactions as a result of social distancing, shelter-in-place or total lock-down orders imposed by countries that began in the second quarter of fiscal 2020. In the quarter, we saw spending improve each month as most countries began to relax these restrictions. Cross-border volume however, continued to be heavily impacted by the decline in travel, which only improved moderately through the quarter. While we have taken measures to modify our business practices and reduce operating expenses, including scaling back hiring plans, restricting travel, lowering marketing spend and the use of external resources, the impact that COVID-19 will have on our business remains difficult to predict due to numerous uncertainties, including the transmissibility, severity and duration of the outbreak, the effectiveness of social distancing measures or actions that are voluntarily adopted by the public or required by governments or public health authorities, the development and availability of effective treatments or vaccines, the impact to our employees and our operations, the business of our clients, supplier and business partners and other factors identified in Part II, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020, filed with the SEC on May 4, 2020. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business. Highlights for the first nine months of fiscal 2020. Net revenues for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020 were $4.8 billion and $16.7 billion, respectively, and decreased 17% and 1%, respectively, over the prior-year comparable periods, driven by the year-over-year changes in nominal payments volume, nominal cross-border volume and processed transactions, which were impacted by the spread of COVID-19 globally starting in the latter part of March 2020. Exchange rate movements in the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020, as partially mitigated by our hedging program, negatively impacted our net revenues by approximately one half of a percentage point and one percentage point, respectively. 31 Table of Contents Total operating expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2020 were $1.8 billion, and decreased 5% over the prior-year comparable period, on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, driven by our overall cost reduction strategy. Total operating expenses for the nine months ended June 30, 2020 were $5.8 billion, on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, and increased 4% and 3%, respectively, over the prior-year comparable period, primarily due to higher depreciation and amortization from our ongoing investments and personnel in support of our strategy for future growth. Non-GAAP financial results. We use non-GAAP financial measures of our performance which exclude certain items which we believe are not representative of our continuing operations and may distort our longer-term operating trends. We consider non-GAAP measures useful to investors because they provide greater transparency into management’s view and assessment of our ongoing operating performance. Starting in fiscal 2020, we revised our non-GAAP methodology to exclude the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments, amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related costs for acquisitions that closed in fiscal 2019 and subsequent periods. Prior year amounts have been restated to conform to our current presentation. • Gains and losses on equity investments. Gains and losses on equity investments include periodic non-cash fair value adjustments and gains and losses upon sale of an investment. These long-term investments are strategic in nature and are primarily private company investments. Gains and losses and the related tax impacts associated with these investments are tied to the performance of the companies that we invest in and therefore do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020, we recorded net realized and unrealized gains of $51 million and $62 million, respectively, and related tax expense of $11 million and $14 million, respectively. For the same prior-year comparable periods, we recorded net realized and unrealized gains of $9 million and $89 million, respectively, and related tax expense of $3 million and $21 million, respectively. • Amortization of acquired intangible assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, customer relationships and brands acquired in connection with business combinations executed beginning in fiscal 2019. Amortization charges for our acquired intangible assets are non-cash and are significantly affected by the timing, frequency and size of our acquisitions, rather than our core operations. As such, we have excluded this amount and the related tax impact to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020, we recorded amortization of acquired intangible assets of $13 million and $35 million, respectively, and related tax benefit of $3 million and $8 million, respectively. For the same prior-year comparable periods, we recorded amortization of acquired intangible assets of $2 million. • Acquisition-related costs. Acquisition-related costs consist primarily of one-time transaction and integration costs associated with our business combinations. These costs include professional fees, technology integration fees, restructuring activities and other direct costs related to the purchase and integration of acquired entities. It also includes retention equity and deferred equity compensation when they are agreed upon as part of the purchase price of the transaction but are required to be recognized as expense post-combination. We have excluded these amounts and the related tax impacts as the expenses are recognized for a limited duration and do not reflect the underlying performance of our business. During the three months ended June 30, 2020, we recorded acquisition-related costs of $4 million. During the nine months ended June 30, 2020, we recorded acquisition-related costs of $11 million and related tax benefit of $2 million. For the same prior-year comparable periods, we recorded acquisition-related costs of $3 million and related tax benefit of $1 million. Non-GAAP operating expense, non-operating income (expense), income tax provision, effective income tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share should not be relied upon as substitutes for, or considered in isolation from, measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following tables reconcile our as-reported financial measures, calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to our respective non-GAAP financial measures for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020 and 2019. 32 Table of Contents Three Months Ended June 30, 2020 Operating Expenses Non-operating Income (Expense) Income Tax Provision Effective Income Tax Rate (1) Net Income Diluted Earnings Per Share (1) (in millions, except percentages and per share data) As reported $ 1,838 $ (67) $ 559 19.1 % $ 2,373 $ 1.07 (Gains) Losses on equity investments, net — (51) (11) (40) (0.02) Amortization of acquired intangible assets (13) — 3 10 — Acquisition-related costs (4) — — 4 — Non-GAAP $ 1,821 $ (118) $ 551 19.0 % $ 2,347 $ 1.06 Nine Months Ended June 30, 2020 Operating Expenses Non-operating Income (Expense) Income Tax Provision Effective Income Tax Rate (1) Net Income Diluted Earnings Per Share (1) (in millions, except percentages and per share data) As reported $ 5,806 $ (204) $ 2,006 18.7 % $ 8,729 $ 3.92 (Gains) Losses on equity investments, net — (62) (14) (48) (0.02) Amortization of acquired intangible assets (35) — 8 27 0.01 Acquisition-related costs (11) — 2 9 — Non-GAAP $ 5,760 $ (266) $ 2,002 18.7 % $ 8,717 $ 3.91 Three Months Ended June 30, 2019 Operating Expenses Non-operating Income (Expense) Income Tax Provision Effective Income Tax Rate (1) Net Income Diluted Earnings Per Share (1) (in millions, except percentages and per share data) As reported $ 1,932 $ (42) $ 765 19.8 % $ 3,101 $ 1.37 (Gains) Losses on equity investments, net — (9) (3) (6) — Amortization of acquired intangible assets (2) — — 2 — Acquisition-related costs (3) — 1 2 — Non-GAAP $ 1,927 $ (51) $ 763 19.8 % $ 3,099 $ 1.37 Nine Months Ended June 30, 2019 Operating Expenses Non-operating Income (Expense) Income Tax Provision Effective Income Tax Rate (1) Net Income Diluted Earnings Per Share (1) (in millions, except percentages and per share data) As reported $ 5,574 $ (93) $ 2,118 19.0 % $ 9,055 $ 3.97 (Gains) Losses on equity investments, net — (89) (21) (68) (0.03) Amortization of acquired intangible assets (2) — — 2 — Acquisition-related costs (3) — 1 2 — Non-GAAP $ 5,569 $ (182) $ 2,098 18.9 % $ 8,991 $ 3.95 (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

In January 2020, our board of directors authorized a $9.5 billion share repurchase program (the “January 2020 Program”). During the three months ended June 30, 2020, we repurchased 6 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market for $1.1 billion. As of June 30, 2020, our January 2020 Program had remaining authorized funds of $7.0 billion for share repurchase. See Note 10—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. 33 Table of Contents Acquisition. On January 13, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Plaid, Inc. for $5.3 billion. We will pay approximately $4.9 billion of cash and $0.4 billion of retention equity and deferred equity consideration. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including ongoing regulatory reviews and approvals , which are expected to be completed by the end of 2020 . Senior notes. In April 2020, we issued fixed-rate senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $4.0 billion, with maturities ranging between 7 and 20 years. See Note 8—Debt to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Payments volume and transaction counts. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues. Nominal payments volume in the United States posted mid to high single-digit growth for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2020 (1) , respectively, driven mainly by consumer debit and commercial, partially offset by decreased spending beginning in the latter part of March 2020 as countries imposed social distancing, shelter-in-place or total lock-down orders. Nominal international payments volume declined as a result of decreased spending related to social distancing, shelter-in-place or total lock-down orders and unfavorable movements in U.S. dollar exchange rates. On a constant-dollar basis, which excludes the impact of exchange rate movements, our international payments volume growth rate for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2020 was 3% and 7%, respectively. Processed transactions declined 13% for the three months ended June 30, 2020 as a result of social distancing, shelter-in-place or total lock-down orders. Processed transactions grew 1% for the nine months ended June 30, 2020, reflecting the ongoing worldwide shift to electronic payments, partially offset by the impact of social distancing, shelter-in-place or total lock-down orders.

(3) Includes consumer prepaid volume and Interlink volume. (4) Includes large, medium and small business credit and debit, as well as commercial prepaid volume. (5) Total nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume. Total nominal payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased on cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink and V PAY brands. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution clients, subject to review by Visa. On occasion, previously presented volume information may be updated. Prior-period updates, other than the change to the payments volume definition, are not material.

Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. Net revenues decreased primarily due to the year-over-year changes in payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions, which were impacted by COVID-19 starting in the latter part of March 2020. Our net revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. Exchange rate movements in the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020, as partially mitigated by our hedging program, negatively impacted our net revenues by approximately one half of a percentage point and one percentage point, respectively. The following table sets forth the components of our net revenues: Three Months Ended June 30, 2020 vs. 2019 Nine Months Ended June 30, 2020 vs. 2019 2020 2019 $ Change % Change (1) 2020 2019 $ Change % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Service revenues $ 2,409 $ 2,405 $ 4 — % $ 7,587 $ 7,164 $ 423 6 % Data processing revenues 2,525 2,662 (137) (5) % 8,100 7,564 536 7 % International transaction revenues 1,102 1,977 (875) (44) % 4,953 5,624 (671) (12) % Other revenues 314 342 (28) (8) % 1,071 968 103 11 % Client incentives (1,513) (1,546) 33 (2) % (4,966) (4,480) (486) 11 % Net revenues $ 4,837 $ 5,840 $ (1,003) (17) % $ 16,745 $ 16,840 $ (95) (1) % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. • Service revenues were flat in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 as COVID-19 spread globally starting in the latter part of March 2020 with a 2% growth in nominal payments volume during the three-month comparable period. Service revenues grew 6% during the nine-month comparable period, in line with nominal payments volume growth of 6%. • Data processing revenues were impacted by a decline in processed transactions of 13% and growth of 1% during the three-month and nine-month comparable periods, respectively, as a result of the spread of COVID-19 globally starting in the latter part of March 2020. Data processing revenues benefited from value-added services, acquisition-related revenues and favorable business mix. For the nine-month comparable period, data processing revenues also benefited from select pricing modifications effective in 2019. • International transaction revenues driven by nominal cross-border volumes, excluding transactions within Europe, declined 48% and 16% during the three-month and nine-month comparable periods, respectively, as COVID-19 spread globally starting in the latter part of March 2020. For the three-month comparable period, international transaction revenues were also impacted by fluctuations in the volatility of a broad range of currencies and favorable business mix. For the nine-month comparable period, international transaction revenues benefited from select pricing modifications effective in 2019. 36 Table of Contents • Other revenues decreased in the third quarter of fiscal 2020 primarily due to lower marketing services revenues, lower value-added services revenues tied to travel-related card benefits and non-recurring revenues in the prior year three-month comparable period. For the nine-month comparable period, other revenues increased primarily due to consulting and marketing services related fees and other value-added services. • Client incentives decreased during the three-month comparable period in correlation with the decline in payments volumes and revenues. In the nine-month comparable period, client incentives increased mainly due to incentives recognized on long-term customer contracts that were initiated or renewed in the past 12 months partially offset by the recent decline in global payments volume. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or execution of new contracts. Operating Expenses The following table sets forth components of our total operating expenses: Three Months Ended June 30, 2020 vs. 2019 Nine Months Ended June 30, 2020 vs. 2019 2020 2019 $ Change % Change (1) 2020 2019 $ Change % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Personnel $ 941 $ 872 $ 69 8 % $ 2,863 $ 2,573 $ 290 11 % Marketing 174 282 (108) (38) % 683 799 (116) (15) % Network and processing 172 184 (12) (7) % 536 528 8 1 % Professional fees 95 113 (18) (16) % 304 305 (1) — % Depreciation and amortization 197 165 32 19 % 571 484 87 18 % General and administrative 258 315 (57) (18) % 840 855 (15) (2) % Litigation provision 1 1 — (40) % 9 30 (21) (72) % Total operating expenses $ 1,838 $ 1,932 $ (94) (5) % $ 5,806 $ 5,574 $ 232 4 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. • Personnel expenses increased primarily due to continued increase in headcount in support of our investment strategy for future growth, offset by lower incentive compensation. • Marketing expenses decreased reflecting our overall cost reduction strategy, the absence of FIFA Women's World Cup in fiscal 2020 and the delay of the Tokyo Olympics to fiscal 2021. The decrease is offset by an increase in client marketing spend during the nine-month comparable period. • Professional fees decreased reflecting our overall cost reduction strategy. • Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additional depreciation and amortization from our on-going investments, including acquisitions. • General and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to travel restrictions and our overall cost reduction strategy, offset by acquisition related expenses during the nine-months comparable period. • Litigation provision decreased primarily due to lower accruals for uncovered litigation. 37 Table of Contents Non-operating Income (Expense) The following table sets forth the components of our non-operating income (expense): Three Months Ended June 30, 2020 vs. 2019 Nine Months Ended June 30, 2020 vs. 2019 2020 2019 $ Change % Change (1) 2020 2019 $ Change % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Interest expense, net $ (142) $ (128) $ (14) 11 % $ (371) $ (413) $ 42 (10) % Investment income and other 75 86 (11) (12) % 167 320 (153) (48) % Total non-operating income (expense) $ (67) $ (42) $ (25) 59 % $ (204) $ (93) $ (111) 120 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. • Interest expense, net increased during the three-month comparable period primarily as a result of the issuance of debt in the third quarter of fiscal 2020, offset by derivative instruments that lowered the cost of borrowing on a portion of our outstanding debt. Interest expense, net decreased during the nine-month comparable period primarily due to derivative instruments that lowered the cost of borrowing on a portion of our outstanding debt, offset by the issuance of debt in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. • Investment income and other decreased primarily due to lower gains on our equity investments and lower interest income on our cash and investments. Effective Income Tax Rate The effective income tax rates were 19 % for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2020, and 20 % and 19 % for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019, respectively. The difference in the effective tax rates between the three-month periods was primarily due to the change in geographic mix of income. On July 22, 2020, UK enacted a legislation that repealed the previous tax rate reduction from 19% to 17% that was effective on April 1, 2020. The repeal of the UK tax rate reduction is not expected to significantly increase our ongoing effective tax rate, however, it will result in a one-time non-cash tax expense in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, due to the re-measurement of deferred taxes which are primarily related to intangibles recorded in purchase accounting upon the acquisition of Visa Europe in fiscal 2016. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Data The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the periods presented: Nine Months Ended June 30, 2020 2019 (in millions) Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 8,344 $ 8,742 Investing activities 2,308 413 Financing activities (4,723) (9,401) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents 173 (62) Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents $ 6,102 $ (308) Operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended June 30, 2020 was lower than the prior-year comparable period due to higher client incentives and timing of settlement. Partially offset by lower cash paid for taxes and the receipt of the $467 million takedown payment associated with the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation. See Note 14—Legal Matters to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. 38 Table of Contents Investing activities. Cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended June 30, 2020 increased primarily due to fewer purchases of investment securities as compared to the prior-year period. Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended June 30, 2020 was lower than the prior-year comparable period primarily due to proceeds received from the issuance of senior notes and the absence of the deferred purchase consideration payment, made in the prior year. Partially offset by higher share repurchase and higher dividends paid. See Note 8—Debt and Note 10—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements . Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings and the returns that these holdings provide. Based on our current cash flow forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our current and projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. Our ability to access cost-effective capital could be impacted by global credit market conditions. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances. Commercial paper program. We maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. During the three months ended June 30, 2020, we repaid $1.0 billion of commercial paper that was issued during the three months ended March 31, 2020. We had no obligations outstanding under the program at June 30, 2020. Senior notes . In April 2020, we issued fixed-rate senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $4.0 billion, with maturities ranging between 7 and 20 years. See Note 8—Debt to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Uses of Liquidity There has been no significant change to our primary uses of liquidity since September 30, 2019, except as discussed below. Common stock repurchases. During the nine months ended June 30, 2020, we repurchased 37 million shares of our class A common stock for $6.6 billion. As of June 30, 2020, our January 2020 Program had remaining authorized funds of $7.0 billion for share repurchase. See Note 10—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Dividends . During the nine months ended June 30, 2020, we declared and paid $2.0 billion in dividends to holders of our common and preferred stock. On July 20, 2020, our board of directors declared a cash dividend in the amount of $0.30 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and UK&I and Europe preferred stock on an as-converted basis), which will be paid on September 1, 2020, to all holders of record as of August 14, 2020. See Note 10—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. All three series of preferred stock and class B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends. Senior notes . A principal payment of $3.0 billion is due on December 14, 2020 on our fixed-rate senior notes issued in December 2015, for which we have sufficient liquidity. See Note 8—Debt to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Acquisition. On January 13, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Plaid, Inc. for $5.3 billion. We will pay approximately $4.9 billion of cash and $0.4 billion of retention equity and deferred equity consideration. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including ongoing regulatory reviews and approvals, which are expected to be completed by the end of 2020 . We intend to fund the acquisition with cash, cash equivalents and investments, as well as through the issuance of new indebtedness. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 3.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED) Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Organization. Visa Inc. (“Visa” or the “Company”) is a global payments technology company that enables fast, secure and reliable electronic payments across more than 200 countries and territories. Visa and its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries, including Visa U.S.A. Inc. (“Visa U.S.A.”), Visa International Service Association (“Visa International”), Visa Worldwide Pte. Limited, Visa Europe Limited (“Visa Europe”), Visa Canada Corporation (“Visa Canada”), Visa Technology & Operations LLC and CyberSource Corporation, operate one of the world’s largest electronic payments networks — VisaNet — which facilitates authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and enables the Company to provide its financial institution and merchant clients a wide range of products, platforms and value-added services. Visa is not a financial institution and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders on Visa products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, Visa’s financial institution clients. Consolidation and basis of presentation. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The Company consolidates its majority-owned and controlled entities, including variable interest entities (“VIEs”) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company’s investments in VIEs have not been material to its unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) requirements for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and, consequently, do not include all of the annual disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. Reference should be made to the Visa Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2019 for additional disclosures, including a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. Use of estimates. The preparation of accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained, and will be recognized in the consolidated financial statements in the period in which such changes occur. Future actual results could differ materially from these estimates. The worldwide spread of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) has created significant uncertainty in the global economy. There have been no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect the spread of COVID-19 as a global pandemic may have, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of COVID-19 and the extent to which COVID-19 impacts the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and difficult to predict. Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities arising from operating leases on the balance sheet. Subsequently, the FASB also issued a series of amendments to this new leases standard that address the transition methods available and clarify the guidance for lessor costs and other aspects of the new leases standard. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition method with comparative periods continuing to be reported using the prior leases standard. The Company elected to apply the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, allowing the Company to carry forward the historical assessment of whether a contract was or contains a lease, lease classification and capitalization of initial direct costs. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In accordance with ASU 2016-02, the Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at its inception. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, and corresponding lease liabilities, are recognized at the commencement date based on the 12 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. For this purpose, the Company considers only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement. As a majority of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The ROU asset also includes any lease payments made prior to commencement and is recorded net of any lease incentives received. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options. The Company does not record a ROU asset and corresponding liability for leases with terms of 12 months or less. The Company does not include renewals in the determination of the lease term unless the renewals are deemed to be reasonably assured at lease commencement. Lease agreements generally contain lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components primarily include payments for maintenance and utilities. The Company does not combine lease payments with non-lease components for any of its leases. Operating leases are recorded as ROU assets, which are included in other assets. The current portion of lease liabilities are included in accrued liabilities and the long-term portion is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company’s lease cost consists of amounts recognized under lease agreements in the results of operations adjusted for impairment and sublease income. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, which allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for adjustments to tax effects that were originally recorded in other comprehensive income due to changes in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate resulting from the enactment of the U.S. tax reform legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Company adopted the ASU effective October 1, 2019. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, which simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in the existing guidance for income taxes and making other minor improvements. The amendments in the ASU are effective for the Company on October 1, 2021. The Company does not plan to early adopt the ASU at this time. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01, which clarifies that an entity should consider observable transactions that require it to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting for the purposes of applying the fair value measurement alternative. The amendments in the ASU are effective for the Company on October 1, 2021. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform. The amendments in the ASU are effective for the Company upon issuance through December 31, 2022. The Company is evaluating the effect ASU 2020-04 will have on its consolidated financial statements. Note 2—Acquisitions Pending Acquisition. On January 13, 2020, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Plaid, Inc. for $ 5.3 billion . The Company will pay approximately $ 4.9 billion of cash and $ 0.4 billion of retention equity and deferred equity consideration. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including ongoing regulatory reviews and approvals, which are expected to be completed by the end of 2020. 13 Table of Contents VISA INC.

Cash equivalents are primarily recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their generally short maturities. The Company defines restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents as cash and cash equivalents that cannot be withdrawn or used for general operating activities. The Company reconciles cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents reported in the consolidated balance sheets that aggregate to the beginning and ending balances shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows as follows: March 31, 2020 September 30, 2019 (in millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 9,740 $ 7,838 Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents: U.S. litigation escrow 1,264 1,205 Customer collateral 1,698 1,648 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 114 141 Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents $ 12,816 $ 10,832 Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan Under the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Company maintains an escrow account from which settlements of, or judgments in, certain litigation referred to as the “U.S. covered litigation” are paid. The escrow funds are held in money market investments along with interest income earned, less applicable taxes, and are classified as restricted cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets. 14 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) On December 13, 2019, the district court entered the final judgment order approving the Amended Settlement Agreement with the Damages Class plaintiffs in the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation proceedings. A takedown payment of approximately $ 467 million was received on December 27, 2019, and deposited into the Company’s litigation escrow account. The deposit into the litigation escrow account and reestablishment of a prior accrual to address opt-out claims was recorded during the six months ended March 31, 2020 . The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the litigation escrow account balance. See Note 14—Legal Matters . The following table sets forth the changes in the restricted cash equivalents—U.S. litigation escrow account: Six Months Ended March 31, 2020 2019 (in millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 1,205 $ 1,491 Return of takedown payment to the litigation escrow account 467 — Payments to class plaintiffs’ settlement fund (1) — ( 600 ) Payments to opt-out merchants (1) and interest earned on escrow funds ( 408 ) 8 Balance at end of period $ 1,264 $ 899 (1) These payments are associated with the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation. See Note 14—Legal Matters . Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plan Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rates in the Visa Europe territory (the “VE territory covered litigation”). Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover certain losses resulting from VE territory covered litigation (the “VE territory covered losses”) through a periodic adjustment to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the UK&I and Europe preferred stock. VE territory covered losses are recorded in “right to recover for covered losses” within equity before the corresponding adjustment to the applicable conversion rate is effected. Adjustments to the conversion rate may be executed once in any six-month period unless a single, individual loss greater than € 20 million is incurred, in which case, the six-month limitation does not apply. When the adjustment to the conversion rate is made, the amount previously recorded in “right to recover for covered losses” as contra-equity is then recorded against the book value of the preferred stock within stockholders’ equity. See Note 14—Legal Matters . There were no adjustments to the conversion rates during the six months ended March 31, 2020 . The following table sets forth the as-converted value of the preferred stock available to recover VE territory covered losses compared to the book value of preferred shares recorded in stockholders’ equity within the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as of March 31, 2020 and September 30, 2019 : March 31, 2020 September 30, 2019 As-Converted Value of Preferred Stock (1),(2) Book Value of Preferred Stock (1) As-Converted Value of Preferred Stock (1),(3) Book Value of Preferred Stock (1) (in millions) UK&I preferred stock $ 5,170 $ 2,285 $ 5,519 $ 2,285 Europe preferred stock 7,062 3,177 7,539 3,177 Total 12,232 5,462 13,058 5,462 Less: right to recover for covered losses ( 184 ) ( 184 ) ( 171 ) ( 171 ) Total recovery for covered losses available $ 12,048 $ 5,278 $ 12,887 $ 5,291 (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

Level 1 assets. Money market funds, marketable equity securities and U.S. Treasury securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets. The Company’s deferred compensation liability is measured at fair value based on marketable equity securities held under the deferred compensation plan. Level 2 assets and liabilities. The fair value of U.S. government-sponsored debt securities, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. The pricing data obtained from outside sources is reviewed internally for reasonableness, compared against benchmark quotes from independent pricing sources, then confirmed or revised accordingly. Derivative instruments are valued using inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. There were no substantive changes to the valuation techniques and related inputs used to measure fair value during the six months ended March 31, 2020 . U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and U.S. Treasury securities. The Company considers U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and U.S. Treasury securities to be available-for-sale and held $ 3.4 billion and $ 6.3 billion of these investment securities as of March 31, 2020 and September 30, 2019 , respectively. All of the Company’s long-term available-for-sale investment securities are due within one to five years . 16 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis Non-marketable equity securities. The Company’s non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. These investments are classified as Level 3 due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and the fact that inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require management’s judgment. During the three months ended March 31, 2020 , the Company recorded no material upward or downward adjustments. During the six months ended March 31, 2020 , $ 9 million of upward adjustments and no material downward adjustments were included in the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities. During the three and six months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 , there were no impairments. The following table summarizes the total carrying value of the Company’s non-marketable equity securities held as of March 31, 2020 including cumulative unrealized gains and losses: March 31, 2020 (in millions) Initial cost basis $ 611 Upward adjustments 119 Downward adjustments (including impairment) ( 5 ) Carrying amount, end of period $ 725 Non-financial assets and liabilities. Long-lived assets such as goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, finite-lived intangible assets and property, equipment and technology are considered non-financial assets. The Company does not have any non-financial liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships and trade names, all of which were obtained through acquisitions. If the Company were required to perform a quantitative assessment for impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair values would generally be estimated using an income approach. As the assumptions employed to measure these assets on a non-recurring basis are based on management’s judgment using internal and external data, these fair value determinations are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company completed its annual impairment review of its indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill as of February 1, 2020, and concluded that there was no impairment. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed at March 31, 2020 . Gains and Losses on Marketable and Non-marketable Equity Securities Gains and losses on the Company’s equity securities are summarized below. Three Months Ended March 31, Six Months Ended March 31, 2020 2019 2020 2019 (in millions) Net gain (loss) on equity securities sold during the period $ 1 $ 15 $ 5 $ 15 Unrealized gain (loss) on equity securities held as of the end of the period ( 23 ) 79 ( 9 ) 59 Total gain (loss) recognized in non-operating income (expense), net $ ( 22 ) $ 94 $ ( 4 ) $ 74 Other Fair Value Disclosures Long-term debt. Debt instruments are measured at amortized cost on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the debt instruments, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. The pricing data obtained from outside sources is reviewed internally for reasonableness, compared against benchmark quotes from independent pricing sources, then confirmed or revised accordingly. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The carrying value and estimated fair value of long-term debt was $ 16.9 billion and $ 18.6 billion , 17 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) respectively, as of March 31, 2020 . The carrying value and estimated fair value of long-term debt was $ 16.7 billion and $ 18.4 billion , respectively, as of September 30, 2019 . Other financial instruments not measured at fair value. The following financial instruments are not measured at fair value on the Company’s unaudited consolidated balance sheet at March 31, 2020 , but disclosure of their fair values is required: settlement receivable and payable, accounts receivable, commercial paper and customer collateral. The estimated fair value of such instruments at March 31, 2020 approximates their carrying value due to their generally short maturities. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Note 7—Leases The Company entered into various operating lease agreements primarily for real estate. The Company's leases have original lease periods expiring between fiscal 2020 and 2030 . Many leases include one or more options to renew. The Company's lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Payments under the Company’s lease arrangements are generally fixed. At March 31, 2020 , the Company had no finance leases. During the three and six months ended March 31, 2020 , total operating lease cost was $ 29 million and $ 55 million , respectively. At March 31, 2020 , the weighted average remaining lease term for operating leases was approximately 7 years and the weighted average discount rate for operating leases was 2.28 % . At March 31, 2020 , the present value of future minimum lease payments was as follows: March 31, 2020 (in millions) Remainder of 2020 $ 48 2021 112 2022 96 2023 89 2024 76 Thereafter 214 Total undiscounted lease payments 635 Less: imputed interest ( 48 ) Present value of lease liabilities $ 587 At March 31, 2020 , the Company had additional operating leases that had not yet commenced with lease obligations of $ 465 million . These operating leases will commence between fiscal 2020 and 2023 with non-cancellable lease terms of 3 to 15 years. 18 Table of Contents VISA INC.

(2) Represents the change in fair value of interest rate swap agreements entered into on a portion of certain outstanding senior notes. Commercial Paper Program Visa maintains a commercial paper program to support its working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. Under the program, the Company is authorized to issue up to $ 3.0 billion in outstanding notes, with maturities up to 397 days from the date of issuance. At March 31, 2020 , the commercial paper outstanding had remaining maturities of less than 12 months. Senior Notes In April 2020, the Company issued fixed-rate senior notes in a public offering in an aggregate principal amount of $ 4.0 billion , with maturities ranging between 7 and 20 years. The April 2027 Notes, 2030 Notes and 2040 Notes, or collectively, the ""2020 Notes"", have interest rates of 1.90 % , 2.05 % and 2.70 % , respectively. Interest on the 2020 Notes is payable semi-annually on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing October 15, 2020. The net aggregate proceeds, after deducting discounts and debt issuance costs, were approximately $ 4.0 billion . The Company plans to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes. Note 9—Settlement Guarantee Management The Company indemnifies its clients for settlement losses suffered due to failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa operating rules. This indemnification creates settlement risk for the Company due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. Historically, the Company has experienced minimal losses as a result of its settlement risk guarantee. However, the Company’s future obligations, which could be material under its guarantees, are not determinable as they are dependent upon future events. 19 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) The Company’s settlement exposure is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time, which vary significantly day to day. The Company’s maximum daily settlement exposure was $ 97.3 billion and the average daily settlement exposure was $ 56.7 billion during the six months ended March 31, 2020 . The Company maintains and regularly reviews global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement exposure, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. At March 31, 2020 and September 30, 2019 , the Company held collateral as follows: March 31, 2020 September 30, 2019 (in millions) Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents $ 1,698 $ 1,648 Pledged securities at market value 235 259 Letters of credit 1,300 1,293 Guarantees 508 477 Total $ 3,741 $ 3,677 Note 10—Stockholders’ Equity As-converted class A common stock.

(3) The class B to class A common stock conversion rate is presented on a rounded basis. Conversion calculations for dividend payments are based on a conversion rate rounded to the tenth decimal. Reduction in as-converted shares. Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through periodic adjustments to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the UK&I and Europe preferred stock. The recovery has the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Company’s class A common stock, because it reduces the UK&I and Europe preferred stock conversion rates and consequently, reduces the as-converted class A common stock share count. There were no conversion rate adjustments in the six months ended March 31, 2020 . See Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . 20 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) Common stock repurchases.

All shares repurchased in the open market have been retired and constitute authorized but unissued shares. (2) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Average repurchase price per share and total cost is calculated based on unrounded numbers. In January 2019, the Company’s board of directors authorized an $ 8.5 billion share repurchase program and in January 2020, authorized an additional $ 9.5 billion share purchase program. These authorizations have no expiration date. As of March 31, 2020 , the Company’s January 2020 share repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $ 8.1 billion for share repurchase. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to January 2020 have been completed. Dividends. O n April 21, 2020 , the Company’s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $ 0.30 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and UK&I and Europe preferred stock on an as-converted basis). The cash dividend will be paid on June 2, 2020 , to all holders of record as of May 14, 2020 . The Company declared and paid $ 668 million and $ 569 million during the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 , respectively and $ 1.3 billion and $ 1.1 billion during the six months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 , respectively, in dividends to holders of the Company’s common and preferred stocks. Note 11—Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to each class of shares by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding and participating securities during the period. Net income is allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities based on its proportional ownership on an as-converted basis. The weighted-average number of shares outstanding of each class of common stock reflects changes in ownership over the periods presented. See Note 10—Stockholders’ Equity . Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding, participating securities and, if dilutive, potential class A common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive class A common stock equivalents may consist of: (1) shares of class A common stock issuable upon the conversion of UK&I and Europe preferred stock and class B and C common stock based on the conversion rates in effect through the period, and (2) incremental shares of class A common stock calculated by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of employee stock options, the assumed purchase of stock under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the assumed vesting of unearned performance shares. 21 Table of Contents VISA INC.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) (1) Net income is allocated based on proportional ownership on an as-converted basis. The weighted-average number of shares of as-converted class B common stock used in the income allocation was 398 million for the three and six months ended March 31, 2020 and 400 million for the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 . The weighted-average number of shares of as-converted class C common stock used in the income allocation was 44 million for the three and six months ended March 31, 2020 and 47 million for the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 . The weighted-average number of shares of preferred stock included within participating securities was 32 million of as-converted UK&I preferred stock for the three and six months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 , and 44 million of as-converted Europe preferred stock for the three and six months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 . (2) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Earnings per share is calculated based on unrounded numbers. (3) Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding are calculated on an as-converted basis and include incremental common stock equivalents, as calculated under the treasury stock method. The computation includes common stock equivalents of 3 million for the three and six months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 , because their effect would have been dilutive. The computation excludes common stock equivalents of 1 million and 2 million for the three and six months ended March 31, 2020 , respectively, and 1 million for the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 , because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. (4) Participating securities include preferred stock outstanding and unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, such as the UK&I and Europe preferred stock and restricted stock units. Participating securities’ income is allocated based on the weighted-average number of shares of as-converted stock. Note 12—Share-based Compensation The Company granted the following equity awards to employees and non-employee directors under the 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan, or the EIP, during the six months ended March 31, 2020 : Granted Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Weighted-Average Exercise Price Non-qualified stock options 1,247,982 $ 29.37 $ 182.50 Restricted stock units 2,264,886 $ 183.27 Performance-based shares (1) 470,128 $ 211.08 (1) Represents the maximum number of performance-based shares which could be earned. The Company recorded share-based compensation cost related to the EIP of $ 93 million and $ 106 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 , respectively, and $ 204 million and $ 201 million for the six months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 , respectively, net of estimated forfeitures, which are adjusted as appropriate. Note 13—Income Taxes The effective income tax rates were 19 % for the three and six months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019. During the three and six months ended March 31, 2020 , the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by $ 112 million and $ 175 million , respectively. The Company’s net unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably impact the effective tax rate, increased by $ 26 million and $ 39 million , respectively. The change in unrecognized tax benefits is primarily related to various tax positions across several jurisdictions. During the three and six months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no significant changes in interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. The Company’s tax filings are subject to examination by the U.S. federal, state and foreign taxing authorities. The timing and outcome of the final resolutions of the various ongoing income tax examinations are highly uncertain. It is not reasonably possible to estimate the increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) was enacted in the U.S. on March 27, 2020. The CARES Act includes several U.S. income tax provisions related to, among other things, net operating loss carrybacks, alternative minimum tax credits, modifications to the net interest deduction limitations, and technical amendments regarding the income tax depreciation of qualified improvement property placed in service after December 31, 2017. The CARES Act is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial results. 23 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) Note 14—Legal Matters The Company is party to various legal and regulatory proceedings. Some of these proceedings involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. Accordingly, except as disclosed, the Company has not established reserves or ranges of possible loss related to these proceedings, as at this time in the proceedings, the matters do not relate to a probable loss and/or the amount or range of losses are not reasonably estimable. Although the Company believes that it has strong defenses for the litigation and regulatory proceedings described below, it could, in the future, incur judgments or fines or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. From time to time, the Company may engage in settlement discussions or mediations with respect to one or more of its outstanding litigation matters, either on its own behalf or collectively with other parties. The litigation accrual is an estimate and is based on management’s understanding of its litigation profile, the specifics of each case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management’s best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date. The following table summarizes the activity related to accrued litigation: Six Months Ended March 31, 2020 2019 (in millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 1,203 $ 1,434 Provision for uncovered legal matters 7 35 Provision for covered legal matters 7 159 Reestablishment of prior accrual related to interchange multidistrict litigation 467 — Payments for legal matters ( 416 ) ( 714 ) Balance at end of period $ 1,268 $ 914 Accrual Summary—U.S. Covered Litigation Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A. and Visa International are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, which the Company refers to as the U.S. covered litigation. See further discussion below under U.S. Covered Litigation and Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . An accrual for the U.S. covered litigation and a charge to the litigation provision are recorded when a loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. In making this determination, the Company evaluates available information, including but not limited to actions taken by the litigation committee. The total accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the escrow account balance. The following table summarizes the accrual activity related to U.S. covered litigation: Six Months Ended March 31, 2020 2019 (in millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 1,198 $ 1,428 Reestablishment of prior accrual related to interchange multidistrict litigation 467 — Payments for U.S. covered litigation ( 414 ) ( 600 ) Balance at end of period $ 1,251 $ 828 24 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) In fiscal 2019, the Company paid $ 600 million from its litigation escrow account into a settlement fund established pursuant to the Amended Settlement Agreement with the Damages Class plaintiffs in the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation. Under the Amended Settlement Agreement, if class members opt out of the Damages Class, the defendants are entitled to receive takedown payments of up to $ 700 million (up to $ 467 million for Visa), based on the percentage of payment card sales volume attributable to merchants who have chosen to opt out. On December 13, 2019, the district court entered a final judgment order approving the Amended Settlement Agreement with the Damages Class plaintiffs. A takedown payment of approximately $ 467 million was received on December 27, 2019, and deposited into the Company’s litigation escrow account. The deposit into the litigation escrow account and reestablishment of a prior accrual to address opt-out claims was recorded during the six months ended March 31, 2020 . See further discussion below under U.S. Covered Litigation . Accrual Summary—VE Territory Covered Litigation Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the Europe retrospective responsibility plan. Unlike the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Europe retrospective responsibility plan does not have an escrow account that is used to fund settlements or judgments. The Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through periodic adjustments to the conversion rates applicable to the UK&I preferred stock and Europe preferred stock. An accrual for the VE territory covered losses and a reduction to stockholders’ equity will be recorded when the loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. See further discussion below under VE Territory Covered Litigation and Note 5—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . The following table summarizes the accrual activity related to VE territory covered litigation: Six Months Ended March 31, 2020 2019 (in millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 5 $ — Provision for VE territory covered litigation 7 159 Payments for VE territory covered litigation ( 1 ) ( 98 ) Balance at end of period $ 11 $ 61 U.S. Covered Litigation Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) – Putative Class Actions On November 20, 2019, the district court denied the bank defendants’ motion to dismiss the claims brought against them by the putative Injunctive Relief Class. On December 13, 2019, the district court granted final approval of the 2018 Amended Settlement Agreement relating to claims by the Damages Class, which was subsequently appealed. Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) - Individual Merchant Actions Visa has reached settlements with a number of merchants representing approximately 30 % of the Visa-branded payment card sales volume of merchants who opted out of the Amended Settlement Agreement with the Damages Class plaintiffs. 25 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (UNAUDITED)—(Continued) VE Territory Covered Litigation Europe Merchant Litigation Since July 2013, in excess of 500 Merchants (the capitalized term “Merchant,” when used in this section, means a merchant together with subsidiary/affiliate companies that are party to the same claim) have commenced proceedings against Visa Europe, Visa Inc. and other Visa subsidiaries in the UK, Germany, Belgium and Poland primarily relating to interchange rates in Europe and in some cases relating to fees charged by Visa and certain Visa rules. As of the filing date, Visa Europe, Visa Inc. and other Visa subsidiaries have settled the claims asserted by over 100 Merchants, leaving more than 400 Merchants with outstanding claims. In addition, over 30 additional Merchants have threatened to commence similar proceedings. Standstill agreements have been entered into with respect to some of those threatened Merchant claims, several of which have been settled. Other Litigation Canadian Merchant Litigation Between August 2019 and January 2020, the Courts of Appeal in British Columbia, Quebec, Ontario and Saskatchewan rejected the appeals filed by Wal-Mart Canada and Home Depot of Canada Inc. In January 2020, Wal-Mart Canada and Home Depot of Canada Inc. filed applications to appeal the decisions of the British Columbia, Quebec and Ontario courts to the Supreme Court of Canada and those applications were denied on March 26, 2020. Wal-Mart Canada and Home Depot of Canada Inc. also filed an application seeking the Supreme Court’s review of the Saskatchewan court's decision. The application and an appeal to the Alberta Court of Appeal remain pending. Nuts for Candy On December 31, 2019, plaintiff filed a motion to dismiss and for attorneys’ fees and costs based on the settlement reached between the parties and the grant of final approval of the 2018 Amended Settlement Agreement as discussed above in Interchange Multidistrict Litigation (MDL) - Putative Class Actions . On February 25, 2020, the court granted plaintiff’s motion to dismiss and for attorneys’ fees and costs. The case has been dismissed with prejudice. Euronet Litigation On December 13, 2019, Euronet 360 Finance Limited, Euronet Polska Spolka z.o.o. and Euronet Services spol. s.r.o. (“Euronet”) served a claim in the UK alleging that certain rules affecting ATM access fees in Poland, the Czech Republic and Greece by Visa Inc. and Mastercard Incorporated, and certain of their subsidiaries, breach various competition laws. Euronet seeks damages, costs, and injunctive relief to prevent the defendants from enforcing the aforementioned rules. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 2. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This management’s discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition and the liquidity and capital resources of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Visa,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company”) on a historical basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings, as well as those factors that may affect future earnings. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that relate to, among other things, the impact on our future financial position, results of operations and cash flows as a result of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”); our future operations, prospects, developments, strategies and growth of our business; anticipated expansion of our products in certain countries; industry developments; anticipated benefits of our acquisitions; expectations regarding litigation matters, investigations and proceedings; timing and amount of stock repurchases; sufficiency of sources of liquidity and funding; effectiveness of our risk management programs; and expectations regarding the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements. Forward-looking statements generally are identified by words such as “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,” “projects,” “could,” “should,” “will,” “continue” and other similar expressions. All statements other than statements of historical fact could be forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made, are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, many of which are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. We describe risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, any of these forward-looking statements in our SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the year ended September 30, 2019 and our subsequent reports on Forms 10-Q and 8-K.

Our advanced transaction processing network, VisaNet, enables authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and allows us to provide our financial institution and merchant clients a wide range of products, platforms and value-added services. Financial overview. Our as-reported U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share are as follows: Three Months Ended March 31, 2020 vs. 2019 Six Months Ended March 31, 2020 vs. 2019 2020 2019 % Change (1) 2020 2019 % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages and per share data) Net income, as reported $ 3,084 $ 2,977 4 % $ 6,356 $ 5,954 7 % Diluted earnings per share, as reported $ 1.38 $ 1.31 6 % $ 2.85 $ 2.61 9 % Non-GAAP net income (2) $ 3,098 $ 2,912 6 % $ 6,370 $ 5,892 8 % Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (2) $ 1.39 $ 1.28 9 % $ 2.85 $ 2.58 11 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. (2) For a full reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial results, see tables in Non-GAAP financial results below. Coronavirus. While we have been actively monitoring the worldwide spread of COVID-19, the extent to which COVID-19 will ultimately impact our business is difficult to predict. Our priority has been the safety of our employees, including comprehensive plans to support employee wellness, as well as support for our clients and the communities affected. Although most of our staff are now working remotely, our network infrastructure and application performance continue to perform well and our business operations have comprehensive and coordinated plans in place to address business continuity and recovery needs around the world. We are also in very close and regular contact with clients, partners and governments globally to help them navigate these challenging times. In the month of March 2020, domestic spending, most notably in travel, restaurants, entertainment and fuel decreased as countries imposed social distancing, shelter-in-place or total lock-down orders. Declines in cross-border volume as well as processed transactions negatively impacted international transaction and data processing revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2020. Service revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2020 were not significantly impacted, as they were recognized on the payments volume for the three months ended December 31, 2019. While we have not incurred operational disruptions thus far from the COVID-19 outbreak, the impact that COVID-19 will have on our business is difficult to predict due to numerous uncertainties, including the severity and duration of the outbreak, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, the impact to the business of our clients and other factors identified in Part II, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-Q. We will continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact to our business. Highlights for the first half of fiscal 2020. We recorded net revenues of $5.9 billion and $11.9 billion for the three and six months ended March 31, 2020 , respectively, an increase of 7% and 8% , respectively, over the prior-year comparable periods, driven by the year-over-year changes in nominal payments volume, nominal cross-border volume and processed transactions, which were not significantly impacted by COVID-19 until the latter part of March 2020. Exchange rate movements in the three and six months ended March 31, 2020 , as partially mitigated by our hedging program, negatively impacted our net revenues growth by approximately one percentage point. Total operating expenses were $1.9 billion and $4.0 billion for the three and six months ended March 31, 2020 , respectively, an increase of 4% and 9% on a GAAP and an increase of 3% and 8% on a non-GAAP basis, respectively, over the prior-year comparable periods. The increase was primarily due to higher personnel, depreciation and amortization, general and administrative, and networking related expenses, as we continue to invest in our business growth. 28 Table of Contents Non-GAAP financial results. We use non-GAAP financial measures of our performance which exclude certain items which we believe are not representative of our continuing operations and may distort our longer-term operating trends. We consider non-GAAP measures useful to investors because they provide greater transparency into management’s view and assessment of our ongoing operating performance. Starting in fiscal 2020, we revised our non-GAAP methodology to exclude the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments, amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related costs for acquisitions that closed in fiscal 2019 and subsequent periods. Prior year amounts have been restated to conform to our current presentation. • Gains and losses on equity investments. Gains and losses on equity investments include periodic non-cash fair value adjustments and gains and losses upon sale of an investment. These long-term investments are strategic in nature and are primarily private company investments. Gains and losses and the related tax impacts associated with these investments are tied to the performance of the companies that we invest in and therefore do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business. During the three months ended March 31, 2020 , we recorded net realized and unrealized losses of $2 million . During the six months ended March 31, 2020, we recorded net realized and unrealized gains of $11 million and related tax expense of $3 million . For the same prior-year comparable periods, we recorded net realized and unrealized gains of $84 million and $80 million, respectively, and related tax expense of $19 million and $18 million, respectively. • Amortization of acquired intangible assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, customer relationships and brands acquired in connection with business combinations executed beginning in fiscal 2019. Amortization charges for our acquired intangible assets are non-cash and are significantly affected by the timing, frequency and size of our acquisitions, rather than our core operations. As such, we have excluded this amount and the related tax impact to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance. During the three and six months ended March 31, 2020 , we recorded amortization of acquired intangible assets of $11 million and $22 million , respectively, and related tax benefit of $2 million and $5 million , respectively. There were no comparable amounts during the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 since we are only adjusting for transactions that closed in fiscal 2019 and subsequent periods. • Acquisition-related costs. Acquisition-related costs consist primarily of one-time transaction and integration costs associated with our business combinations. These costs include professional fees, technology integration fees, restructuring activities and other direct costs related to the purchase and integration of acquired entities. It also includes retention equity and deferred equity compensation when they are agreed upon as part of the purchase price of the transaction but are required to be recognized as expense post-combination. We have excluded these amounts and the related tax impacts as the expenses are recognized for a limited duration and do not reflect the underlying performance of our business. During the three and six months ended March 31, 2020 , we recorded acquisition-related costs of $5 million and $7 million , respectively, and related tax benefit of $2 million during both the three and six months ended March 31, 2020 . There were no comparable amounts during the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 since we are only adjusting for transactions that closed in fiscal 2019 and subsequent periods. Non-GAAP operating expense, non-operating income (expense), income tax provision, effective income tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share should not be relied upon as substitutes for, or considered in isolation from, measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following tables reconcile our as-reported financial measures, calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to our respective non-GAAP financial measures for the three and six months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 .

Effective income tax rate, diluted earnings per share and their respective totals are calculated based on unrounded numbers. Common stock repurchases. In January 2019, our board of directors authorized an $8.5 billion share repurchase program and in January 2020, authorized an additional $9.5 billion share repurchase program. During the three months ended March 31, 2020 , we repurchased 18 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market for $3.1 billion . As of March 31, 2020 , our January 2020 share repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $8.1 billion for share repurchase. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to January 2020 have been completed. See Note 10—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Acquisition. On January 13, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Plaid, Inc. for $5.3 billion. We will pay approximately $4.9 billion of cash and $0.4 billion of retention equity and deferred equity consideration. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including ongoing regulatory reviews and approvals , which are expected to be completed by the end of 2020 . Senior notes. In April 2020, we issued fixed-rate senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $4.0 billion, with maturities ranging between 7 and 20 years. See Note 8—Debt to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Payments volume and transaction counts. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues. Nominal payments volume in the United States posted high single-digit growth for the three and six months ended December 31, 2019 (1) , driven mainly by consumer debit and commercial. Nominal international payments volume growth was negatively impacted by movements in U.S. dollar exchange rates. On a constant-dollar basis, which excludes the impact of exchange rate movements, our international payments volume growth rate for the three and six months ended December 31, 2019 was 8% and 9% , respectively. Growth in processed transactions reflects the ongoing worldwide shift to electronic payments, even with the decrease in processed transactions the latter part of March 2020 as COVID-19 spread throughout the world. 30 Table of Contents The following table presents nominal payments and cash volume: United States International Visa Inc.

Therefore, service revenues reported for the three and six months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 were based on nominal payments volume reported by our financial institution clients for the three and six months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. (2) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes and totals are calculated based on unrounded numbers. (3) Includes consumer prepaid volume and Interlink volume. (4) Includes large, medium and small business credit and debit, as well as commercial prepaid volume. (5) Total nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume. Total nominal payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased on cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink and V PAY brands. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution clients, subject to review by Visa. On occasion, previously presented volume information may be updated. Prior-period updates, other than the change to the payments volume definition, are not material. (6) Growth on a constant-dollar basis excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar. 31 Table of Contents The following table provides the number of transactions involving cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink, V PAY and PLUS cards processed on Visa’s networks during the periods presented: Three Months Ended March 31, Six Months Ended March 31, 2020 2019 % Change (1) 2020 2019 % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Visa processed transactions 34,941 32,544 7 % 72,716 66,476 9 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage change is calculated based on unrounded numbers. Results of Operations Net Revenues The following table sets forth our net revenues earned in the U.S. and internationally: Three Months Ended March 31, 2020 vs. 2019 Six Months Ended March 31, 2020 vs. 2019 2020 2019 $ Change % Change (1) 2020 2019 $ Change % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) U.S. $ 2,650 $ 2,479 $ 171 7 % $ 5,367 $ 4,987 $ 380 8 % International 3,204 3,015 189 6 % 6,541 6,013 528 9 % Net revenues $ 5,854 $ 5,494 $ 360 7 % $ 11,908 $ 11,000 $ 908 8 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. Net revenues increased primarily due to the year-over-year changes in payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions, which were not significantly impacted by COVID-19 until the latter part of March 2020. The increase in revenues was also partially offset by the increase in client incentives. Our net revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. Exchange rate movements in the three and six months ended March 31, 2020 , as partially mitigated by our hedging program, negatively impacted our net revenues growth by approximately one percentage point . The following table sets forth the components of our net revenues: Three Months Ended March 31, 2020 vs. 2019 Six Months Ended March 31, 2020 vs. 2019 2020 2019 $ Change % Change (1) 2020 2019 $ Change % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Service revenues $ 2,623 $ 2,417 $ 206 9 % $ 5,178 $ 4,759 $ 419 9 % Data processing revenues 2,711 2,432 279 11 % 5,575 4,902 673 14 % International transaction revenues 1,833 1,796 37 2 % 3,851 3,647 204 6 % Other revenues 392 327 65 20 % 757 626 131 21 % Client incentives (1,705 ) (1,478 ) (227 ) 15 % (3,453 ) (2,934 ) (519 ) 18 % Net revenues $ 5,854 $ 5,494 $ 360 7 % $ 11,908 $ 11,000 $ 908 8 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. • Service revenues increased primarily due to 8% growth in nominal payments volume during the three and six month comparable periods as well as select pricing modifications effective in 2019, partially offset by unfavorable business mix. Service revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2020 were not significantly impacted by COVID-19 as they were recognized on the payments volume for the three months ended December 31, 2019. 32 Table of Contents • Data processing revenues increased mainly due to overall growth in processed transactions of 7% and 9% during the three and six month comparable periods, respectively, select pricing modifications effective in 2019, as well as faster growth of our value-added services and acquisition-related revenue. The growth of our data processing revenues was negatively impacted in the latter part of March 2020 by the decrease in processed transactions as COVID-19 spread throughout the world. • International transaction revenues increased primarily due to select pricing modifications effective in 2019 . International transaction revenues also reflected fluctuations in the volatility of a broad range of currencies as well as a 4% decline and 2% growth in nominal cross-border volumes during the three and six month comparable periods, respectively, due to the decrease in cross-border volume through the quarter as COVID-19 spread throughout the world. • Other revenues increased primarily due to higher revenues from value-added services. • Client incentives increased mainly due to incentives recognized on long-term customer contracts that were initiated or renewed in the past 12 months and overall growth in global payments volume. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or execution of new contracts. Operating Expenses The following table sets forth components of our total operating expenses: Three Months Ended March 31, 2020 vs. 2019 Six Months Ended March 31, 2020 vs. 2019 2020 2019 $ Change % Change (1) 2020 2019 $ Change % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Personnel $ 940 $ 894 $ 46 5 % $ 1,922 $ 1,701 $ 221 13 % Marketing 235 241 (6 ) (3 )% 509 517 (8 ) (1 )% Network and processing 183 171 12 7 % 364 344 20 6 % Professional fees 103 101 2 2 % 209 192 17 9 % Depreciation and amortization 192 160 32 20 % 374 319 55 17 % General and administrative 269 264 5 2 % 582 540 42 8 % Litigation provision 8 22 (14 ) (67 )% 8 29 (21 ) (73 )% Total operating expenses $ 1,930 $ 1,853 $ 77 4 % $ 3,968 $ 3,642 $ 326 9 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. • Personnel expenses increased primarily due to continued increase in headcount offset by lower incentive compensation for the three-month comparable period. For the six-month comparable period, expenses increased due to continued headcount growth in support of our investment strategy for future growth. • Network and processing expenses increased mainly due to continued technology and processing network investments to support growth. • Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additional depreciation and amortization from our on-going investments, including acquisitions. • General and administrative expenses increased mainly due to reclassification of certain expenses to general and administrative, higher product enhancements costs in support of our business growth and higher indirect taxes, offset by favorable currency fluctuations. • Litigation provision decreased primarily due to lower accruals for uncovered litigation. 33 Table of Contents Non-operating Income (Expense) The following table sets forth the components of our non-operating income (expense): Three Months Ended March 31, 2020 vs. 2019 Six Months Ended March 31, 2020 vs. 2019 2020 2019 $ Change % Change (1) 2020 2019 $ Change % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Interest expense, net $ (118 ) $ (140 ) $ 22 (16 )% $ (229 ) $ (285 ) $ 56 (20 )% Investment income and other 23 176 (153 ) (87 )% 92 234 (142 ) (61 )% Total non-operating income (expense) $ (95 ) $ 36 $ (131 ) (367 )% $ (137 ) $ (51 ) $ (86 ) 170 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. • Interest expense, net decreased primarily as a result of entering into derivative instruments in fiscal 2019 that lowered the cost of borrowing on a portion of our outstanding debt. • Investment income and other decreased primarily due to lower gains on our equity investments and lower interest income on our cash and investments. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Data The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the periods presented: Six Months Ended March 31, 2020 2019 (in millions) Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 5,342 $ 5,358 Investing activities 2,441 (396 ) Financing activities (5,887 ) (5,486 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 88 (171 ) Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents $ 1,984 $ (695 ) Operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended March 31, 2020 was slightly lower than the prior-year comparable period due to higher client incentives and timing of settlement. Partially offset by continued growth in our underlying business and receipt of the $467 million takedown payment associated with the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation. See Note 14—Legal Matters to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Investing activities. Cash provided by investing activities for the six months ended March 31, 2020 increased primarily due to higher sales of investment securities and fewer purchases of investment securities as compared to the prior-year period. Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities for the six months ended March 31, 2020 was slightly higher than the prior-year comparable period primarily due to higher share repurchase and higher dividends paid. Partially offset by proceeds received from the issuance of commercial paper. See Note 8—Debt and Note 10—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements . 34 Table of Contents Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings and the returns that these holdings provide. Based on our current cash flow forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our current and projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. Our ability to access cost-effective capital could be impacted by global credit market conditions. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances. Commercial paper program. We maintain a commercial paper program to support our working capital requirements and for other general corporate purposes. The carrying amount outstanding at March 31, 2020 was $1.0 billion , with a weighted-average interest rate of 1.55% and remaining maturities of less than 12 months. See Note 8—Debt to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Senior notes . In April 2020, we issued fixed-rate senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $4.0 billion , with maturities ranging between 7 and 20 years. See Note 8—Debt to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Uses of Liquidity There has been no significant change to our primary uses of liquidity since September 30, 2019 , except as discussed below. Common stock repurchases. In January 2020, our board of directors authorized a $9.5 billion share repurchase program. During the six months ended March 31, 2020 , we repurchased 31 million shares of our class A common stock for $5.5 billion . As of March 31, 2020 , our January 2020 share repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $8.1 billion for share repurchase. See Note 10—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Dividends . During the six months ended March 31, 2020 , we declared and paid $1.3 billion in dividends to holders of our common and preferred stock. On April 21, 2020 , our board of directors declared a cash dividend in the amount of $0.30 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and UK&I and Europe preferred stock on an as-converted basis), which will be paid on June 2, 2020 , to all holders of record as of May 14, 2020 . See Note 10—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. All three series of preferred stock and class B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends. Senior notes . In December 2015, we issued fixed-rate senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $16.0 billion, with maturities ranging between 2 and 30 years. A principal payment of $3.0 billion is due on December 14, 2020, for which we have sufficient liquidity. See Note 8—Debt to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Acquisition. On January 13, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Plaid, Inc. for $5.3 billion. We will pay approximately $4.9 billion of cash and $0.4 billion of retention equity and deferred equity consideration. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including ongoing regulatory reviews and approvals, which are expected to be completed by the end of 2020 . We intend to fund the acquisition with cash, cash equivalents and investments, as well as through the issuance of new indebtedness. ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk There have been no significant changes to our market risks since September 30, 2019 . 35 Table of Contents ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) of Visa Inc. at the end of the period covered by this report and, based on such evaluation, have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures of Visa Inc. were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of such date. Changes in internal control over financial reporting. There have been no changes in the internal control over financial reporting of Visa Inc. that occurred during the fiscal period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We have not experienced any material impact to our internal controls over financial reporting although most of our staff are now working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are continually monitoring and assessing the COVID-19 situation on our internal controls to address impacts to their design, implementation and operating effectiveness. 36 Table of Contents PART II. OTHER INFORMATION ITEM 1. Legal Proceedings. Refer to Note 14—Legal Matters to the unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q for a description of the Company’s current material legal proceedings. ITEM 1A. Risk Factors. There have been no material updates to the “Risk Factors” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2019 , filed with the SEC on November 14, 2019, other than as set forth below. Business Risks The extent to which the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) outbreak and measures taken in response thereto impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict. The global impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak and related government actions taken to reduce the spread of the virus have been weighing on the macroeconomic environment, and have significantly increased economic uncertainty and reduced economic activity. Risks related to consumers and businesses changing spending habits, which affect domestic and cross-border activity, are described in our risk factor titled “Global economic, political, market, and social events or conditions may harm our business” under “Risk Factors-Business Risks” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2019. The outbreak has resulted in authorities implementing numerous measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place or total lock-down orders and business limitations and shutdowns. Such measures have significantly caused rising unemployment in many countries, affected our cross-border and domestic payment activity and negatively impacted consumer and business spending. Governments around the globe have taken steps to mitigate some of the more severe economic effects of the virus, but there can be no assurance that such steps will be effective or achieve their desired results in a timely fashion. The outbreak has adversely impacted and is likely to further adversely impact our workforce and operations and the operations of our clients, customers, suppliers and business partners. COVID-19 impacted both card present and card not present cross-border travel related spending, initially in Asia during February, and then globally and more significantly in March as the outbreak spread to the rest of the world. In addition, as countries imposed social distancing, shelter-in-place or total lock-down orders, domestic spending, most notably in travel, restaurants, entertainment and fuel, sharply declined in the latter part of March. In particular, we may experience financial losses due to a number of operational factors, including: • merchant, acquirer and issuer failures and credit settlement risk, particularly with respect to the retail, travel and hospitality industries, including airlines, cruise ships, hotels, restaurants and entertainment events; • third party disruptions, including potential outages at network providers, call centers and other suppliers; • increased cyber and payment fraud risk related to COVID-19, as cybercriminals attempt to profit from the disruption, given increased online banking, e-commerce and other online activity; • challenges to the availability and reliability of our network due to changes to normal operations, including the possibility of one or more clusters of COVID-19 cases occurring at our data centers, affecting our employees, or affecting the systems or employees of our issuers, acquirers or merchants; and • additional regulatory requirements, including, for example, government initiatives or requests to reduce or eliminate payments fees or other costs. These factors may remain prevalent for a significant period of time and may continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided. 37 Table of Contents The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices (including restricting employee travel, developing social distancing plans for our employees and cancelling physical participation in meetings, events and conferences), and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers and business partners. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus or will otherwise be satisfactory to government authorities. The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition in the longer term will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and are difficult to predict, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions broadly resume. Even after the COVID-19 outbreak has subsided, we may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of the virus’s global economic impact, including lower domestic and cross border spending trends, the availability of credit, adverse impacts on our liquidity and any recessionary conditions that occur and persist. There are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect the spread of COVID-19 may have on our business, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of the outbreak is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of the impacts on our business or the global economy as a whole. However, the effects could have a material impact on our results of operations and heighten many of our known risks described in the “Risk Factors” section of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2019, including, but not limited to: • “Increased scrutiny and regulation of the global payments industry, including with respect to interchange reimbursement fees, merchant discount rates, operating rules, risk management protocols and other related practices, could harm our business;” • “We depend on relationships with financial institutions, acquirers, processors, merchants, and other third parties;” • “ A disruption, failure or breach of our networks or systems, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could harm our business ;” and • “Our indemnification obligation to fund settlement losses of our clients exposes us to significant risk of loss and may reduce our liquidity.” ITEM 2. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities and Use of Proceeds. ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES The table below sets forth our purchases of common stock during the quarter ended March 31, 2020 : Period Total Number of Shares Purchased Average Purchase Price per Share Total Number of Shares Purchased as Part of Publicly Announced Plans or Programs (1),(2) Approximate Dollar Value of Shares that May Yet Be Purchased Under the Plans or Programs (1),(2) (in millions, except per share data) January 1-31, 2020 4 $ 198.53 4 $ 10,357 February 1-29, 2020 4 $ 202.86 4 $ 9,582 March 1-31, 2020 10 $ 164.01 10 $ 7,942 Total 18 $ 180.10 18 (1) The figures in the table reflect transactions according to the trade dates. For purposes of our unaudited consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10-Q, the impact of these repurchases is recorded according to settlement dates. (2) Our board of directors from time to time authorizes the repurchase of shares of our common stock up to a certain monetary limit. In January 2020 and 2019, our board of directors authorized share repurchase programs for $9.5 billion and $8.5 billion, respectively. These authorizations have no expiration date. All share repurchases authorized prior to January 2020 have been completed. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 3. Defaults Upon Senior Securities. None. ITEM 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. Not applicable.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2019 (UNAUDITED) Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Organization. Visa Inc. (“Visa” or the “Company”) is a global payments technology company that enables fast, secure and reliable electronic payments across more than 200 countries and territories. Visa and its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries, including Visa U.S.A. Inc. (“Visa U.S.A.”), Visa International Service Association (“Visa International”), Visa Worldwide Pte. Limited, Visa Europe Limited (“Visa Europe”), Visa Canada Corporation (“Visa Canada”), Visa Technology & Operations LLC and CyberSource Corporation, operate one of the world’s largest electronic payments networks — VisaNet — which facilitates authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and enables the Company to provide its financial institution and merchant clients a wide range of products, platforms and value-added services. Visa is not a financial institution and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders on Visa products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, Visa’s financial institution clients. Consolidation and basis of presentation. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The Company consolidates its majority-owned and controlled entities, including variable interest entities (“VIEs”) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company’s investments in VIEs have not been material to its unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) requirements for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and, consequently, do not include all of the annual disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. Reference should be made to the Visa Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2019 for additional disclosures, including a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities arising from operating leases on the balance sheet. Subsequently, the FASB also issued a series of amendments to this new leases standard that address the transition methods available and clarify the guidance for lessor costs and other aspects of the new leases standard. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2019 using the modified retrospective transition method with comparative periods continuing to be reported using the prior leases standard. The Company elected to apply the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, allowing the Company to carry forward the historical assessment of whether a contract was or contains a lease, lease classification and capitalization of initial direct costs. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In accordance with ASU 2016-02, the Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at its inception. Right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, and corresponding lease liabilities, are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. For this purpose, the Company considers only payments that are fixed and determinable at the time of commencement. As a majority of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The ROU asset also includes any lease payments made prior to commencement and is recorded net of any lease incentives received. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options. The Company does not record a ROU asset and corresponding liability for leases with terms of 12 months or less. 10 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) The Company does not include renewals in the determination of the lease term unless the renewals are deemed to be reasonably assured at lease commencement. Lease agreements generally contain lease and non-lease components. Non-lease components primarily include payments for maintenance and utilities. The Company does not combine lease payments with non-lease components for any of its leases. Operating leases are recorded as ROU assets, which are included in other assets. The current portion of lease liabilities are included in accrued liabilities and the long-term portion is included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company’s lease cost consists of amounts recognized under lease agreements in the results of operations adjusted for impairment and sublease income. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, which allows a reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income to retained earnings for adjustments to tax effects that were originally recorded in other comprehensive income due to changes in the U.S. federal corporate income tax rate resulting from the enactment of the U.S. tax reform legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”). The Company adopted the ASU effective October 1, 2019. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, which simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles in the existing guidance for income taxes and making other minor improvements. The amendments in the ASU are effective for the Company on October 1, 2021. The Company does not plan to early adopt the ASU at this time. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In January 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-01, which clarifies that an entity should consider observable transactions that require it to either apply or discontinue the equity method of accounting for the purposes of applying the fair value measurement alternative. The amendments in the ASU are effective for the Company on October 1, 2021. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Note 2—Revenues The nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of the Company’s revenues and cash flows and how they are affected by economic factors are most appropriately depicted through the Company’s revenue categories and geographical markets. The following tables disaggregate the Company’s net revenues by revenue category and by geography for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 : Three Months Ended December 31, 2019 2018 (in millions) Service revenues $ 2,555 $ 2,342 Data processing revenues 2,864 2,470 International transaction revenues 2,018 1,851 Other revenues 365 299 Client incentives ( 1,748 ) ( 1,456 ) Net revenues $ 6,054 $ 5,506 Three Months Ended December 31, 2019 2018 (in millions) U.S. $ 2,717 $ 2,508 International 3,337 2,998 Net revenues $ 6,054 $ 5,506 11 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) Note 3—Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents The Company’s cash and cash equivalents include cash and certain highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are primarily recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their generally short maturities. The Company defines restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents as cash and cash equivalents that cannot be withdrawn or used for general operating activities. The Company reconciles cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents reported in the consolidated balance sheets that aggregate to the beginning and ending balances shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows as follows: December 31, 2019 September 30, 2019 (in millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 8,768 $ 7,838 Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents: U.S. litigation escrow 1,634 1,205 Customer collateral 1,698 1,648 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 163 141 Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents $ 12,263 $ 10,832 Note 4—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan Under the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Company maintains an escrow account from which settlements of, or judgments in, certain litigation referred to as the “U.S. covered litigation” are paid. The escrow funds are held in money market investments along with interest income earned, less applicable taxes, and are classified as restricted cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets. On December 13, 2019, the district court entered the final judgment order approving the Amended Settlement Agreement with the Damages Class plaintiffs in the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation proceedings. A takedown payment of approximately $ 467 million was received on December 27, 2019, and deposited into the Company’s litigation escrow account. The deposit into the litigation escrow account and reestablishment of a prior accrual to address opt-out claims was recorded during the three months ended December 31, 2019 . The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the litigation escrow account balance. See Note 13—Legal Matters . The following table sets forth the changes in the restricted cash equivalents—U.S. litigation escrow account: Three Months Ended December 31, 2019 2018 (in millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 1,205 $ 1,491 Return of takedown payment to the litigation escrow account 467 — Payments to opt-out merchants (1) and interest earned on escrow funds ( 38 ) 5 Balance at end of period $ 1,634 $ 1,496 (1) These payments are associated with the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation. See Note 13—Legal Matters . 12 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plan Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rates in the Visa Europe territory (the “VE territory covered litigation”). Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover certain losses resulting from VE territory covered litigation (the “VE territory covered losses”) through a periodic adjustment to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the UK&I and Europe preferred stock. VE territory covered losses are recorded in “right to recover for covered losses” within equity before the corresponding adjustment to the applicable conversion rate is effected. Adjustments to the conversion rate may be executed once in any six-month period unless a single, individual loss greater than € 20 million is incurred, in which case, the six-month limitation does not apply. When the adjustment to the conversion rate is made, the amount previously recorded in “right to recover for covered losses” as contra-equity is then recorded against the book value of the preferred stock within stockholders’ equity. See Note 13—Legal Matters . There were no adjustments to the conversion rates during the three months ended December 31, 2019 . The following table sets forth the as-converted value of the preferred stock available to recover VE territory covered losses compared to the book value of preferred shares recorded in stockholders’ equity within the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2019 : December 31, 2019 September 30, 2019 As-Converted Value of Preferred Stock (1),(2) Book Value of Preferred Stock (1) As-Converted Value of Preferred Stock (1),(3) Book Value of Preferred Stock (1) (in millions) UK&I preferred stock $ 6,029 $ 2,285 $ 5,519 $ 2,285 Europe preferred stock 8,236 3,177 7,539 3,177 Total 14,265 5,462 13,058 5,462 Less: right to recover for covered losses ( 175 ) ( 175 ) ( 171 ) ( 171 ) Total recovery for covered losses available $ 14,090 $ 5,287 $ 12,887 $ 5,291 (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. As-converted and book values are based on unrounded numbers.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) Note 5—Fair Value Measurements and Investments Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Fair Value Measurements Using Inputs Considered as Level 1 Level 2 December 31, 2019 September 30, 2019 December 31, 2019 September 30, 2019 (in millions) Assets Cash equivalents and restricted cash equivalents: Money market funds $ 7,539 $ 6,494 U.S. government-sponsored debt securities $ 350 $ 150 Investment securities: Marketable equity securities 154 126 U.S. government-sponsored debt securities 4,565 5,592 U.S. Treasury securities 902 675 Other current and non-current assets: Derivative instruments 274 437 Total $ 8,595 $ 7,295 $ 5,189 $ 6,179 Liabilities Accrued compensation and benefits: Deferred compensation liability $ 141 $ 113 Accrued and other liabilities: Derivative instruments $ 99 $ 52 Total $ 141 $ 113 $ 99 $ 52 There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 assets during the three months ended December 31, 2019 . Level 1 assets. Money market funds, marketable equity securities and U.S. Treasury securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets. The Company’s deferred compensation liability is measured at fair value based on marketable equity securities held under the deferred compensation plan. Level 2 assets and liabilities. The fair value of U.S. government-sponsored debt securities, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. The pricing data obtained from outside sources is reviewed internally for reasonableness, compared against benchmark quotes from independent pricing sources, then confirmed or revised accordingly. Derivative instruments are valued using inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. There were no substantive changes to the valuation techniques and related inputs used to measure fair value during the three months ended December 31, 2019 . U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and U.S. Treasury securities. The Company considers U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and U.S. Treasury securities to be available-for-sale and held $ 5.5 billion and $ 6.3 billion of these investment securities as of December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2019 , respectively. All of the Company’s long-term available-for-sale investment securities are due within one to five years . 14 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis Non-marketable equity securities. The Company’s non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. These investments are classified as Level 3 due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and the fact that inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require management’s judgment. During the three months ended December 31, 2019 , $ 9 million of upward adjustments and no downward adjustments were included in the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities. During the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , there were no significant impairments. The following table summarizes the total carrying value of the Company’s non-marketable equity securities held as of December 31, 2019 including cumulative unrealized gains and losses: December 31, 2019 (in millions) Initial cost basis $ 595 Upward adjustments 119 Downward adjustments (including impairment) ( 4 ) Carrying amount, end of period $ 710 Non-financial assets and liabilities. Long-lived assets such as goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, finite-lived intangible assets and property, equipment and technology are considered non-financial assets. The Company does not have any non-financial liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships and trade names, all of which were obtained through acquisitions. If the Company were required to perform a quantitative assessment for impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair values would generally be estimated using an income approach. As the assumptions employed to measure these assets on a non-recurring basis are based on management’s judgment using internal and external data, these fair value determinations are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company completed its annual impairment review of its indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill as of February 1, 2019, and concluded that there was no impairment. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed at December 31, 2019 . Gains and Losses on Marketable and Non-marketable Equity Securities Gains and losses on the Company’s equity securities are summarized below. Three Months Ended December 31, 2019 2018 (in millions) Net gain (loss) on equity securities sold during the period $ 4 $ — Unrealized gain (loss) on equity securities held as of the end of the period 14 ( 20 ) Total gain (loss) recognized in non-operating income (expense), net $ 18 $ ( 20 ) Other Fair Value Disclosures Long-term debt. Debt instruments are measured at amortized cost on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the debt instruments, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. The pricing data obtained from outside sources is reviewed internally for reasonableness, compared against benchmark quotes from independent pricing sources, then confirmed or revised accordingly. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The carrying value and estimated fair value of long-term debt was $ 16.7 billion and $ 18.3 billion , respectively, as of December 31, 2019 . The carrying value and estimated fair value of long-term debt was $ 16.7 billion and $ 18.4 billion , respectively, as of September 30, 2019 . 15 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) Other financial instruments not measured at fair value. The following financial instruments are not measured at fair value on the Company’s unaudited consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2019 , but disclosure of their fair values is required: settlement receivable and payable, accounts receivable and customer collateral. The estimated fair value of such instruments at December 31, 2019 approximates their carrying value due to their generally short maturities. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Note 6—Leases The Company entered into various operating lease agreements primarily for real estate. The Company's leases have original lease periods expiring between fiscal 2020 and 2030 . Many leases include one or more options to renew. The Company's lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Payments under the Company’s lease arrangements are generally fixed. At December 31, 2019 , the Company had no finance leases. During the three months ended December 31, 2019 , total operating lease cost was $ 26 million . At December 31, 2019 , the weighted average remaining lease term for operating leases was approximately 7 years and the weighted average discount rate for operating leases was 2.31 % . At December 31, 2019 , the present value of future minimum lease payments was as follows: December 31, 2019 (in millions) Remainder of 2020 $ 82 2021 108 2022 93 2023 86 2024 73 Thereafter 186 Total undiscounted lease payments 628 Less: imputed interest ( 54 ) Present value of lease liabilities $ 574 At December 31, 2019 , the Company had additional operating leases that had not yet commenced with lease obligations of $ 507 million . These operating leases will commence between fiscal 2020 and 2023 with non-cancellable lease terms of 5 to 15 years. 16 Table of Contents VISA INC.

(2) Represents the change in fair value of interest rate swap agreements entered into on a portion of the outstanding Senior Notes. Note 8—Settlement Guarantee Management The Company indemnifies its clients for settlement losses suffered due to failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa operating rules. This indemnification creates settlement risk for the Company due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. Historically, the Company has experienced minimal losses as a result of its settlement risk guarantee. However, the Company’s future obligations, which could be material under its guarantees, are not determinable as they are dependent upon future events. The Company’s settlement exposure is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time, which vary significantly day to day. The Company’s maximum daily settlement exposure was $ 97.3 billion and the average daily settlement exposure was $ 59.2 billion during the three months ended December 31, 2019 . The Company maintains and regularly reviews global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement exposure, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. At December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2019 , the Company held collateral as follows: December 31, 2019 September 30, 2019 (in millions) Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents $ 1,698 $ 1,648 Pledged securities at market value 241 259 Letters of credit 1,325 1,293 Guarantees 506 477 Total $ 3,770 $ 3,677 17 Table of Contents VISA INC.

As-converted class A common stock is calculated based on unrounded numbers. (2) Class A common stock shares outstanding reflect repurchases that settled on or before December 31, 2019 and September 30, 2019 . (3) The class B to class A common stock conversion rate is presented on a rounded basis. Conversion calculations for dividend payments are based on a conversion rate rounded to the tenth decimal. Reduction in as-converted shares. Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through periodic adjustments to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the UK&I and Europe preferred stock. The recovery has the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Company’s class A common stock, because it reduces the UK&I and Europe preferred stock conversion rates and consequently, reduces the as-converted class A common stock share count. There were no conversion rate adjustments in the three months ended December 31, 2019 . See Note 4—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans. Common stock repurchases. The following table presents share repurchases in the open market for the following periods: Three Months Ended December 31, 2019 2018 (in millions, except per share data) Shares repurchased in the open market (1) 13 17 Average repurchase price per share (2) $ 179.27 $ 138.11 Total cost (2) $ 2,370 $ 2,393 (1) Shares repurchased in the open market reflect repurchases that settled during the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 . All shares repurchased in the open market have been retired and constitute authorized but unissued shares. (2) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Average repurchase price per share and total cost is calculated based on unrounded numbers. In January 2019, the Company’s board of directors authorized an $ 8.5 billion share purchase program. As of December 31, 2019 , the Company’s January 2019 share repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $ 1.7 billion for share repurchase. In January 2020 , the Company’s board of directors authorized an additional $ 9.5 billion share repurchase program. These authorizations have no expiration date. Dividends. O n January 28, 2020 , the Company’s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $ 0.30 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and UK&I and Europe preferred stock on an as-converted basis). The cash dividend will be paid on March 3, 2020 , to all holders of record as of February 14, 2020 . The Company declared and paid $ 671 million and $ 572 million during the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, in dividends to holders of the Company’s common and preferred stocks. 18 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) Note 10—Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to each class of shares by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding and participating securities during the period. Net income is allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities based on its proportional ownership on an as-converted basis. The weighted-average number of shares outstanding of each class of common stock reflects changes in ownership over the periods presented. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity . Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding, participating securities and, if dilutive, potential class A common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive class A common stock equivalents may consist of: (1) shares of class A common stock issuable upon the conversion of UK&I and Europe preferred stock and class B and C common stock based on the conversion rates in effect through the period, and (2) incremental shares of class A common stock calculated by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of employee stock options, the assumed purchase of stock under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the assumed vesting of unearned performance shares. The following table presents earnings per share for the three months ended December 31, 2019 : Basic Earnings Per Share Diluted Earnings Per Share (in millions, except per share data) Income Allocation (A) (1) Weighted- Average Shares Outstanding (B) Earnings per Share = (A)/(B) (2) Income Allocation (A) (1) Weighted- Average Shares Outstanding (B) Earnings per Share = (A)/(B) (2) Class A common stock $ 2,506 1,713 $ 1.46 $ 3,272 2,240 (3) $ 1.46 Class B common stock 583 245 $ 2.37 582 245 $ 2.37 Class C common stock 65 11 $ 5.85 65 11 $ 5.84 Participating securities (4) 118 Not presented Not presented 117 Not presented Not presented Net income $ 3,272 The following table presents earnings per share for the three months ended December 31, 2018 : Basic Earnings Per Share Diluted Earnings Per Share (in millions, except per share data) Income Allocation (A) (1) Weighted- Average Shares Outstanding (B) Earnings per Share = (A)/(B) (2) Income Allocation (A) (1) Weighted- Average Shares Outstanding (B) Earnings per Share = (A)/(B) (2) Class A common stock $ 2,290 1,760 $ 1.30 $ 2,977 2,291 (3) $ 1.30 Class B common stock 521 245 $ 2.12 520 245 $ 2.12 Class C common stock 61 12 $ 5.20 61 12 $ 5.20 Participating securities (4) 105 Not presented Not presented 105 Not presented Not presented Net income $ 2,977 (1) Net income is allocated based on proportional ownership on an as-converted basis. The weighted-average number of shares of as-converted class B common stock used in the income allocation was 398 million and 400 million for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The weighted-average number of shares of as-converted class C common stock used in the income allocation was 44 million and 47 million for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The weighted-average number of shares of preferred stock included within participating securities was 32 million of as-converted UK&I preferred stock for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 . The weighted-average number of shares of preferred stock included within participating securities was 44 million of as-converted Europe preferred stock for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 . (2) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Earnings per share is calculated based on unrounded numbers. (3) Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding are calculated on an as-converted basis and include incremental common stock equivalents, as calculated under the treasury stock method. The computation includes approximately 3 million common stock equivalents for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , because their effect would have been dilutive. The computation excludes 1 million of common stock equivalents for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. (4) Participating securities include preferred stock outstanding and unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, such as the Company’s UK&I and Europe preferred stock, restricted stock units and earned performance-based shares. Participating securities’ income is allocated based on the weighted-average number of shares of as-converted stock. 19 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) Note 11—Share-based Compensation The Company granted the following equity awards to employees and non-employee directors under the 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan, or the EIP, during the three months ended December 31, 2019 : Granted Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Weighted-Average Exercise Price Non-qualified stock options 1,247,982 $ 29.37 $ 182.50 Restricted stock units 2,189,944 $ 182.62 Performance-based shares (1) 470,128 $ 211.08 (1) Represents the maximum number of performance-based shares which could be earned.

Note 12—Income Taxes The effective income tax rates were 18 % for both the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. During the three months ended December 31, 2019 , the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by $ 63 million , of which $ 13 million would favorably impact the effective tax rate, if recognized. The change in unrecognized tax benefits is primarily related to various tax positions across several jurisdictions. During the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, there were no significant changes in interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. The Company’s tax filings are subject to examination by the U.S. federal, state and foreign taxing authorities. The timing and outcome of the final resolutions of the various ongoing income tax examinations are highly uncertain. It is not reasonably possible to estimate the increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. Note 13—Legal Matters The Company is party to various legal and regulatory proceedings. Some of these proceedings involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. Accordingly, except as disclosed, the Company has not established reserves or ranges of possible loss related to these proceedings, as at this time in the proceedings, the matters do not relate to a probable loss and/or the amount or range of losses are not reasonably estimable. Although the Company believes that it has strong defenses for the litigation and regulatory proceedings described below, it could, in the future, incur judgments or fines or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. From time to time, the Company may engage in settlement discussions or mediations with respect to one or more of its outstanding litigation matters, either on its own behalf or collectively with other parties. The litigation accrual is an estimate and is based on management’s understanding of its litigation profile, the specifics of each case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management’s best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date. 20 Table of Contents VISA INC.

See further discussion below under U.S. Covered Litigation and Note 4—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . An accrual for the U.S. covered litigation and a charge to the litigation provision are recorded when a loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. In making this determination, the Company evaluates available information, including but not limited to actions taken by the litigation committee. The total accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the escrow account balance. The following table summarizes the accrual activity related to U.S. covered litigation: Three Months Ended December 31, 2019 2018 (in millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 1,198 $ 1,428 Reestablishment of prior accrual related to interchange multidistrict litigation 467 — Payments for U.S. covered litigation ( 41 ) — Balance at end of period $ 1,624 $ 1,428 In fiscal 2019, the Company paid $ 600 million from its litigation escrow account into a settlement fund established pursuant to the Amended Settlement Agreement with the Damages Class plaintiffs in the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation. Under the Amended Settlement Agreement, if class members opt out of the Damages Class, the defendants are entitled to receive takedown payments of up to $ 700 million (up to $ 467 million for Visa), based on the percentage of payment card sales volume attributable to merchants who have chosen to opt out. On December 13, 2019, the district court entered a final judgment order approving the Amended Settlement Agreement with the Damages Class plaintiffs. A takedown payment of approximately $ 467 million was received on December 27, 2019, and deposited into the Company’s litigation escrow account. The deposit into the litigation escrow account and reestablishment of a prior accrual to address opt-out claims was recorded during the three months ended December 31, 2019 . See further discussion below under U.S. Covered Litigation . Accrual Summary—VE Territory Covered Litigation Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the Europe retrospective responsibility plan. Unlike the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Europe retrospective responsibility plan does not have an escrow account that is used to fund settlements or judgments. The Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through periodic adjustments to the conversion rates applicable to the UK&I preferred stock and Europe preferred stock. An accrual for the VE territory covered losses and a reduction to stockholders’ equity will be recorded when the loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. See further discussion below under VE Territory Covered Litigation and Note 4—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . 21 Table of Contents VISA INC.

VE Territory Covered Litigation Europe Merchant Litigation Since July 2013, in excess of 500 Merchants (the capitalized term “Merchant,” when used in this section, means a merchant together with subsidiary/affiliate companies that are party to the same claim) have commenced proceedings against Visa Europe, Visa Inc. and other Visa subsidiaries in the UK, Germany and Belgium primarily relating to interchange rates in Europe and in some cases relating to fees charged by Visa and certain Visa rules. As of the filing date, Visa Europe, Visa Inc. and other Visa subsidiaries have settled the claims asserted by over 100 Merchants, leaving more than 400 Merchants with outstanding claims. In addition, over 30 additional Merchants have threatened to commence similar proceedings. Standstill agreements have been entered into with respect to some of those threatened Merchant claims, several of which have been settled. Other Litigation Canadian Merchant Litigation Between August 2019 and January 2020, the Courts of Appeal in British Columbia, Quebec, Ontario and Saskatchewan rejected the appeals filed by Wal-Mart Canada and Home Depot of Canada Inc. In January 2020, Wal-Mart Canada and Home Depot of Canada Inc. filed applications to appeal the decisions of the British Columbia, Quebec and Ontario courts to the Supreme Court of Canada.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations This management’s discussion and analysis provides a review of the results of operations, financial condition and the liquidity and capital resources of Visa Inc. and its subsidiaries (“Visa,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company”) on a historical basis and outlines the factors that have affected recent earnings, as well as those factors that may affect future earnings. The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that relate to, among other things, our future operations, prospects, developments, strategies and growth of our business; anticipated expansion of our products in certain countries; industry developments; anticipated benefits of our acquisitions; expectations regarding litigation matters, investigations and proceedings; timing and amount of stock repurchases; sufficiency of sources of liquidity and funding; effectiveness of our risk management programs; and expectations regarding the impact of recent accounting pronouncements on our consolidated financial statements. Forward-looking statements generally are identified by words such as “believes,” “estimates,” “expects,” “intends,” “may,” “projects,” “could,” “should,” “will,” “continue” and other similar expressions.

Financial overview. Our as-reported U.S. GAAP and non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share are as follows: Three Months Ended December 31, 2019 vs 2018 2019 2018 % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages and per share data) Net income, as reported $ 3,272 $ 2,977 10 % Diluted earnings per share, as reported $ 1.46 $ 1.30 12 % Non-GAAP net income (2) $ 3,272 $ 2,980 10 % Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (2) $ 1.46 $ 1.30 12 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. (2) For a full reconciliation of our non-GAAP financial results, see tables in Non-GAAP financial results below. Highlights for the first quarter of fiscal 2020. Our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending. Our business performance during the three months ended December 31, 2019 reflects continued global consumer spending growth amidst uneven global economic conditions. We recorded net revenues of $6.1 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2019 , an increase of 10% over the prior-year comparable period, reflecting continued growth in nominal payments volume, nominal cross-border volume and processed transactions. Exchange rate movements in the three months ended December 31, 2019 , as partially mitigated by our hedging program, negatively impacted our net revenues growth by approximately one percentage point. Total operating expenses were $2.0 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2019 , an increase of 14% on a GAAP and an increase of 13% on a non-GAAP basis, respectively, over the prior-year comparable period. The increase was primarily due to higher personnel, professional fees, depreciation and amortization and general and administrative expenses, as we continue to invest in our business growth. Non-GAAP financial results. We use non-GAAP financial measures of our performance which exclude certain items which we believe are not representative of our continuing operations and may distort our longer-term operating trends. We consider non-GAAP measures useful to investors because they provide greater transparency into management’s view and assessment of our ongoing operating performance. Starting in fiscal 2020, we revised our non-GAAP methodology to exclude the impact of gains and losses on our equity investments, amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related costs for acquisitions that closed in fiscal 2019 and subsequent periods. Prior year amounts have been restated to conform to our current presentation. • Gains and losses on equity investments. Gains and losses on equity investments include periodic non-cash fair value adjustments and gains and losses upon sale of an investment. These long-term investments are strategic in nature and are primarily private company investments. Gains and losses and the related tax impacts associated with these investments are tied to the performance of the companies that we invest in and therefore do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business. During the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 , we recorded net realized and unrealized gains of $13 million and losses of $4 million , respectively, and related tax expense of $3 million and tax benefit of $1 million , respectively. • Amortization of acquired intangible assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, customer relationships and brands acquired in connection with business combinations executed beginning in fiscal 2019. Amortization charges for our acquired intangible assets are non-cash and are significantly affected by the timing, frequency and size of our acquisitions, rather than our core operations. As such, we have excluded this amount and the related tax impact to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance. During the three months ended December 31, 2019, we recorded amortization of acquired intangible assets of $11 25 Table of Contents million and related tax benefit of $3 million . There were no comparable amounts during the three months ended December 31, 2018 since we are only adjusting for transactions that closed in fiscal 2019 and subsequent periods. • Acquisition-related costs. Acquisition-related costs consist primarily of one-time transaction and integration costs associated with our business combinations. These costs include professional fees, technology integration fees, restructuring activities and other direct costs related to the purchase and integration of acquired entities. It also includes retention equity and deferred equity compensation when they are agreed upon as part of the purchase price of the transaction but are required to be recognized as expense post-combination. We have excluded these amounts and the related tax impacts as the expenses are recognized for a limited duration and do not reflect the underlying performance of our business. During the three months ended December 31, 2019, we recorded acquisition-related costs of $2 million . There were no comparable amounts during the three months ended December 31, 2018 since we are only adjusting for transactions that closed in fiscal 2019 and subsequent periods. Non-GAAP operating expense, non-operating income (expense), income tax provision, effective income tax rate, net income and diluted earnings per share should not be relied upon as substitutes for, or considered in isolation from, measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following tables reconcile our as-reported financial measures, calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to our respective non-GAAP financial measures for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 . Three Months Ended December 31, 2019 Operating Expenses Non-operating Income (Expense) Income Tax Provision Effective Income Tax Rate (1) Net Income Diluted Earnings Per Share (1) (in millions, except percentages and per share data) As reported $ 2,038 $ (42 ) $ 702 17.7 % $ 3,272 $ 1.46 (Gains) Losses on equity investments, net — (13 ) (3 ) (10 ) — Amortization of acquired intangible assets (11 ) — 3 8 — Acquisition-related costs (2 ) — — 2 — Non-GAAP $ 2,025 $ (55 ) $ 702 17.7 % $ 3,272 $ 1.46 Three Months Ended December 31, 2018 Operating Expenses Non-operating Income (Expense) Income Tax Provision Effective Income Tax Rate (1) Net Income Diluted Earnings Per Share (1) (in millions, except percentages and per share data) As reported $ 1,789 $ (87 ) $ 653 18.0 % $ 2,977 $ 1.30 (Gains) Losses on equity investments, net — 4 1 3 — Non-GAAP $ 1,789 $ (83 ) $ 654 18.0 % $ 2,980 $ 1.30 (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Effective income tax rate, diluted earnings per share and their respective totals are calculated based on unrounded numbers. Common stock repurchases. During the three months ended December 31, 2019 , we repurchased 13 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market using $2.4 billion of cash on hand. As of December 31, 2019 , we had remaining authorized funds of $1.7 billion for share repurchase. In January 2020, our board of directors authorized an additional $9.5 billion share repurchase program. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Acquisition. On January 13, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Plaid, Inc. for $5.3 billion. We will pay approximately $4.9 billion of cash and $0.4 billion of retention equity and deferred equity consideration. This acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions, including certain regulatory approvals, and is expected to close in the next three to six months. 26 Table of Contents Payments volume and transaction counts. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues. Nominal payments volume in the United States posted high single-digit growth for the three months ended September 30, 2019 (1) , driven mainly by consumer debit and commercial. Nominal international payments volume growth was negatively impacted by movements in U.S. dollar exchange rates. On a constant-dollar basis, which excludes the impact of exchange rate movements, our international payments volume growth rate for the three months ended September 30, 2019 was 10% . Growth in processed transactions reflects the ongoing worldwide shift to electronic payments. The following table presents nominal payments and cash volume: United States International Visa Inc. Three Months Ended September 30, (1) Three Months Ended September 30, (1) Three Months Ended September 30, (1) 2019 2018 % Change (2) 2019 2018 % Change (2) 2019 2018 % Change (2) (in billions, except percentages) Nominal payments volume Consumer credit $ 404 $ 382 6 % $ 646 $ 616 5 % $ 1,050 $ 997 5 % Consumer debit (3) 448 408 10 % 500 458 9 % 948 867 9 % Commercial (4) 170 155 10 % 101 93 9 % 271 248 10 % Total nominal payments volume (2) $ 1,023 $ 945 8 % $ 1,247 $ 1,167 7 % $ 2,270 $ 2,112 7 % Cash volume 148 145 2 % 565 578 (2 )% 712 723 (1 )% Total nominal volume (2),(5) $ 1,170 $ 1,090 7 % $ 1,812 $ 1,745 4 % $ 2,982 $ 2,834 5 % The following table presents nominal and constant payments and cash volume growth: International Visa Inc.

Therefore, service revenues reported for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 were based on nominal payments volume reported by our financial institution clients for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. (2) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes and totals are calculated based on unrounded numbers. (3) Includes consumer prepaid volume and Interlink volume. (4) Includes large, medium and small business credit and debit, as well as commercial prepaid volume. (5) Total nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume. Total nominal payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased on cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink and V PAY brands. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution clients, subject to review by Visa. On occasion, previously presented volume information may be updated. Prior-period updates, other than the change to the payments volume definition, are not material. (6) Growth on a constant-dollar basis excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar. The following table provides the number of transactions involving cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink, V PAY and PLUS cards processed on Visa’s networks during the periods presented: Three Months Ended December 31, 2019 2018 % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Visa processed transactions 37,775 33,931 11 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage change is calculated based on unrounded numbers. 27 Table of Contents Results of Operations Net Revenues The following table sets forth our net revenues earned in the U.S. and internationally: Three Months Ended December 31, 2019 vs. 2018 2019 2018 $ Change % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) U.S. $ 2,717 $ 2,508 $ 209 8 % International 3,337 2,998 339 11 % Net revenues $ 6,054 $ 5,506 $ 548 10 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. The increase in net revenues reflects the continued growth in nominal payments volume, nominal cross-border volume and processed transactions. The increase in revenues was partially offset by the increase in client incentives. Our net revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. Exchange rate movements in the three months ended December 31, 2019 , as partially mitigated by our hedging program, negatively impacted our net revenues growth by approximately one percentage point . The following table sets forth the components of our net revenues: Three Months Ended December 31, 2019 vs. 2018 2019 2018 $ Change % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Service revenues $ 2,555 $ 2,342 $ 213 9 % Data processing revenues 2,864 2,470 394 16 % International transaction revenues 2,018 1,851 167 9 % Other revenues 365 299 66 22 % Client incentives (1,748 ) (1,456 ) (292 ) 20 % Net revenues $ 6,054 $ 5,506 $ 548 10 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. • Service revenues increased primarily due to 7% growth in nominal payments volume as well as select pricing modifications effective in 2019. • Data processing revenues increased mainly due to overall growth in processed transactions of 11% , select pricing modifications effective in 2019, as well as faster growth of our value-added services, favorable business mix and acquisition-related revenue. • International transaction revenues increased due to a 7% growth in nominal cross-border volumes and select pricing modifications effective in 2019 . These increases were partially offset by lower volatility in a broad range of currencies. • Other revenues increased primarily due to higher revenues from value-added services. • Client incentives increased mainly due to incentives recognized on long-term customer contracts that were initiated or renewed in 2019 and overall growth in global payments volume. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or execution of new contracts. 28 Table of Contents Operating Expenses The following table sets forth components of our total operating expenses: Three Months Ended December 31, 2019 vs. 2018 2019 2018 $ Change % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Personnel $ 982 $ 807 $ 175 22 % Marketing 274 276 (2 ) (1 )% Network and processing 181 173 8 5 % Professional fees 106 91 15 16 % Depreciation and amortization 182 159 23 15 % General and administrative 313 276 37 13 % Litigation provision — 7 (7 ) (94 )% Total operating expenses $ 2,038 $ 1,789 $ 249 14 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. • Personnel expenses increased primarily due to continued increase in headcount and higher incentive compensation, reflecting our strategy to invest in future growth. • Professional fees expenses increased mainly due to costs incurred in connection with our merger and acquisition activities. • Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to additional depreciation from our on-going investments, including acquisitions. • General and administrative expenses increased mainly due to higher product enhancements costs in support of our business growth and higher indirect taxes. Non-operating Income (Expense) The following table sets forth the components of our non-operating income (expense): Three Months Ended December 31, 2019 vs. 2018 2019 2018 $ Change % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Interest expense, net $ (111 ) $ (145 ) $ 34 (23 )% Investment income and other 69 58 11 19 % Total non-operating income (expense) $ (42 ) $ (87 ) $ 45 (52 )% (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. • Interest expense, net decreased primarily as a result of entering into derivative instruments in 2019 that lowered the cost of borrowing on a portion of our outstanding debt. • Investment income and other increased primarily due to gains on our equity investments. 29 Table of Contents Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Data The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the periods presented: Three Months Ended December 31, 2019 2018 (in millions) Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 3,875 $ 3,294 Investing activities 562 (70 ) Financing activities (3,133 ) (3,018 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 127 (68 ) Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents $ 1,431 $ 138 Operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended December 31, 2019 was higher than the prior-year comparable period due to continued growth in our underlying business and receipt of the $467 million takedown payment associated with the Interchange Multidistrict Litigation. See Note 13—Legal Matters to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Investing activities. Cash provided by investing activities for the three months ended December 31, 2019 increased primarily due to fewer purchases of investment securities as compared to the prior-year period. Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities for the three months ended December 31, 2019 was slightly higher than the prior-year comparable period primarily due to higher dividends paid. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements . Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings and the returns that these holdings provide. Based on our current cash flow forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our current and projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances. Uses of Liquidity There has been no significant change to our primary uses of liquidity since September 30, 2019 , except as discussed below. Common stock repurchases. During the three months ended December 31, 2019 , we repurchased 13 million shares of our class A common stock using $2.4 billion of cash on hand. As of December 31, 2019 , we had remaining authorized funds of $1.7 billion for share repurchase. In January 2020, our board of directors authorized an additional $9.5 billion share repurchase program. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Dividends . During the three months ended December 31, 2019 , we declared and paid $0.7 billion in dividends to holders of our common and preferred stock.

See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. All three series of preferred stock and class B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends. 30 Table of Contents Senior Notes . In December 2015, we issued fixed-rate senior notes in an aggregate principal amount of $16.0 billion, with maturities ranging between 2 and 30 years. A principal payment of $3.0 billion is due on December 14, 2020, for which we have sufficient liquidity. See Note 7—Debt to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Acquisition. On January 13, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Plaid, Inc. for $5.3 billion. We will pay approximately $4.9 billion of cash and $0.4 billion of retention equity and deferred equity consideration.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS June 30, 2019 (UNAUDITED) Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Organization. Visa Inc. (“Visa” or the “Company”) is a global payments technology company that enables fast, secure and reliable electronic payments across more than 200 countries and territories. Visa and its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries, including Visa U.S.A. Inc. (“Visa U.S.A.”), Visa International Service Association (“Visa International”), Visa Worldwide Pte. Limited, Visa Europe Limited (“Visa Europe”), Visa Canada Corporation (“Visa Canada”), Visa Technology & Operations LLC and CyberSource Corporation, operate one of the world’s largest retail electronic payments networks — VisaNet — which facilitates authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and enables the Company to provide its financial institution and merchant clients a wide range of products, platforms and value-added services. VisaNet also offers fraud protection for account holders and assured payment for merchants. Visa is not a bank and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders on Visa products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, Visa’s financial institution clients. Consolidation and basis of presentation. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The Company consolidates its majority-owned and controlled entities, including variable interest entities (“VIEs”) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company’s investments in VIEs have not been material to its consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirements for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and, consequently, do not include all of the annual disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. Reference should be made to the Visa Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2018 for additional disclosures, including a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements. In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of goods or services to customers. This new revenue standard replaces all existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP. Subsequently, the FASB also issued a series of amendments to the new revenue standard. The new revenue standard changes the classification and timing of recognition of certain client incentives and marketing-related funds paid to customers, as well as revenues and expenses for market development funds and services provided to customers as an incentive. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method applied to the aggregate of all modifications for contracts not completed as of October 1, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning after October 1, 2018 are presented under the new revenue standard. The comparative prior period amounts appearing on the financial statements have not been restated and continue to be reported under the prior revenue standard. See Note 2—Revenues for the impact of the new revenue standard on the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 . 12 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) The following table summarizes the cumulative transition adjustments for the adoption of the new revenue standard recorded on the October 1, 2018 consolidated balance sheet to reflect the aggregate impact to all contracts not completed as of October 1, 2018: Fiscal Year 2018 Closing Balance Sheet Cumulative Transition Adjustment for New Revenue Standard Fiscal Year 2019 Opening Balance Sheet (in millions) Assets Current portion of client incentives $ 340 $ 199 $ 539 Client incentives 538 614 1,152 Liabilities Client incentives 2,834 241 3,075 Accrued liabilities 1,160 6 1,166 Deferred tax liabilities 4,618 108 4,726 Other liabilities 2,666 58 2,724 Equity Accumulated income 11,318 400 11,718 In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, which amends certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments, including the requirement to measure certain equity investments at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective transition method for marketable equity securities and the prospective method for non-marketable equity securities. The Company has elected to use the measurement alternative for non-marketable equity securities, defined as cost adjusted for changes from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer, less impairment. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities arising from operating leases on the balance sheet. Subsequently, the FASB also issued a series of amendments to this new lease standard that address the transition methods available and clarify the guidance for lessor costs and other aspects of the new lease standard. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2019 and expects to adopt using the modified retrospective transition method without restating comparative periods. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, which requires that entities recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2018. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, which requires that a statement of cash flows includes the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2018. The adoption impacted the presentation of transactions related to the U.S. litigation escrow account and customer collateral on the consolidated statements of cash flows. The prior period statement of cash flows have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the impact of this ASU, which had no impact on the Company’s balance sheets, statements of operations or statements of comprehensive income for any period. 13 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, which requires that the service cost component of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost be presented in the same line item as other employee compensation costs, while the other components be presented separately as non-operating income (expense). In addition, only the service cost component is eligible for capitalization, when applicable. Retrospective application is required for the change in income statement presentation while the change in capitalized benefit cost is required to be applied prospectively. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2018, which did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. The service cost component of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost is presented in personnel expenses while the other components are presented in other non-operating expense on the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. The Company did not apply the standard retrospectively for the change in income statement presentation as the impact would have been immaterial. In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, which amends the scope of modification accounting for share-based payment arrangements. Specifically, an entity would not apply modification accounting if the fair value, vesting conditions, and classification of the awards are the same immediately before and after the modification. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2018. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, which improves the financial reporting of hedging instruments to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements. Visa early adopted the standard effective January 1, 2019, which did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, which aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2018. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Note 2—Revenues Impact of the New Revenue Standard The following tables summarize the impact of the new revenue standard on the Company’s consolidated statement of operations for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 and the consolidated balance sheet as of June 30, 2019 : For the Three Months Ended June 30, 2019 For the Nine Months Ended June 30, 2019 As Reported Impact of the New Revenue Standard Results Under Prior Revenue Standard As Reported Impact of the New Revenue Standard Results Under Prior Revenue Standard (in millions) Net revenues $ 5,840 $ ( 88 ) $ 5,752 $ 16,840 $ ( 179 ) $ 16,661 Operating Expenses Marketing 282 ( 31 ) 251 799 ( 100 ) 699 Professional fees 113 ( 5 ) 108 305 ( 12 ) 293 General and administrative 315 ( 11 ) 304 855 ( 21 ) 834 Total operating expenses 1,932 ( 47 ) 1,885 5,574 ( 133 ) 5,441 Operating income 3,908 ( 41 ) 3,867 11,266 ( 46 ) 11,220 Income before income taxes 3,866 ( 41 ) 3,825 11,173 ( 46 ) 11,127 Income tax provision 765 ( 8 ) 757 2,118 ( 6 ) 2,112 Net income 3,101 ( 33 ) 3,068 9,055 ( 40 ) 9,015 14 Table of Contents VISA INC.

The following tables disaggregate the Company’s net revenues by revenue category and by geography for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 : Three Months Ended June 30, Nine Months Ended June 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 (in millions) Service revenues $ 2,405 $ 2,196 $ 7,164 $ 6,595 Data processing revenues 2,662 2,359 7,564 6,633 International transaction revenues 1,977 1,830 5,624 5,248 Other revenues 342 229 968 688 Client incentives ( 1,546 ) ( 1,374 ) ( 4,480 ) ( 3,989 ) Net revenues $ 5,840 $ 5,240 $ 16,840 $ 15,175 Three Months Ended June 30, Nine Months Ended June 30, 2019 2018 2019 2018 (in millions) U.S. $ 2,587 $ 2,334 $ 7,573 $ 6,896 International 3,253 2,906 9,267 8,279 Net revenues $ 5,840 $ 5,240 $ 16,840 $ 15,175 Revenue recognition. The Company's net revenues are comprised principally of the following categories: service revenues, data processing revenues, international transaction revenues, and other revenues, reduced by costs incurred under client incentives arrangements. As a payment network service provider, the Company’s obligation to the customer is to stand ready to provide continuous access to our payment network over the contractual term. Consideration is variable based primarily upon the amount and type of transactions and payments volume on Visa’s products. The Company recognizes revenues, net of sales and other similar taxes, as the payment network services are performed. Fixed fees for payment network services are generally recognized ratably over the related service period. The Company has elected the optional exemption to not disclose the remaining performance obligations related to payment network services. 15 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) Service revenues consist of revenues earned for services provided in support of client usage of Visa products. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current pricing applied to the prior quarter's payments volume. The Company also earns revenues from assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives, which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted. Data processing revenues consist of revenues earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among the Company's clients globally. Data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are performed. International transaction revenues are earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer is different from that of the merchant. International transaction revenues are primarily generated by cross-border payments and cash volume. Other revenues consist mainly of license fees for use of the Visa brand, fees for account holder services, licensing and certification and other activities related to the Company's acquired entities. Other revenues also include optional services or product enhancements, such as extended account holder protection and concierge services. Other revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are performed. Client incentives. The Company enters into long-term contracts with financial institution clients, merchants and strategic partners for various programs designed to increase revenues recognized by growing payments volume, increasing Visa product acceptance, winning merchant routing transactions over to Visa's network and driving innovation. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to revenues or as operating expenses if the payment is in exchange for a distinct good or service provided by the customer. The Company generally capitalizes upfront and fixed incentive payments under these agreements and amortizes the amounts as a reduction to revenues ratably over the contractual term. Incentives that are earned by the customer based on performance targets are recorded as reductions to revenues based on management's estimate of each client's future performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted, as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. Note 3—Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents The Company’s cash and cash equivalents include cash and certain highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are primarily recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their generally short maturities. The Company defines restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents as cash and cash equivalents that cannot be withdrawn or used for general operating activities. The Company reconciles cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents reported in the consolidated balance sheets that aggregate to the beginning and ending balances shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows as follows: June 30, September 30, 2019 2018 2018 2017 (in millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 7,912 $ 8,505 $ 8,162 $ 9,874 Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents: U.S. litigation escrow 902 1,487 1,491 1,031 Customer collateral 1,668 1,346 1,324 1,106 Prepaid expenses and other current assets 187 — — — Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents $ 10,669 $ 11,338 $ 10,977 $ 12,011 16 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) Note 4—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan Under the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Company maintains an escrow account from which settlements of, or judgments in, certain litigation referred to as the “U.S. covered litigation” are paid. The escrow funds are held in money market investments along with interest income earned, less applicable taxes, and are classified as restricted cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets. The balance of the escrow account was $ 902 million at June 30, 2019 and $ 1.5 billion at September 30, 2018 . The Company paid $ 600 million from the litigation escrow account during the nine months ended June 30, 2019 . See Note 13—Legal Matters . The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the litigation escrow account balance. The Company did not record an additional accrual for the U.S. covered litigation during the nine months ended June 30, 2019 . See Note 13—Legal Matters . Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plan Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rates in the Visa Europe territory (the “VE territory covered litigation”). Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover certain losses resulting from VE territory covered litigation (the “VE territory covered losses”) through a periodic adjustment to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the UK&I and Europe preferred stock. VE territory covered losses are recorded in “right to recover for covered losses” within equity before the corresponding adjustment to the applicable conversion rate is effected. Adjustments to the conversion rate may be executed once in any six-month period unless a single, individual loss greater than € 20 million is incurred, in which case, the six-month limitation does not apply. When the adjustment to the conversion rate is made, the amount previously recorded in “right to recover for covered losses” as contra-equity is then recorded against the book value of the preferred stock within stockholders’ equity. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 , the Company recovered $ 2 million and $ 8 million , respectively, of VE territory covered losses through adjustments to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the UK&I and Europe preferred stock. The conversion rates applicable to the UK&I and Europe preferred stock were reduced from 12.955 and 13.888 , respectively, as of September 30, 2018 to 12.936 and 13.884 , respectively, as of June 30, 2019 . The following table sets forth the activities related to VE territory covered losses in preferred stock and “right to recover for covered losses” within equity during the nine months ended June 30, 2019 . VE territory covered losses incurred reflect settlements with merchants and additional legal costs. See Note 13—Legal Matters .

Level 1 assets. Money market funds, publicly-traded equity securities and U.S. Treasury securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets. 18 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) Level 2 assets and liabilities. The fair value of U.S. government-sponsored debt securities, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. The pricing data obtained from outside sources is reviewed internally for reasonableness, compared against benchmark quotes from independent pricing sources, then confirmed or revised accordingly. Derivative instruments are valued using inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. There were no substantive changes to the valuation techniques and related inputs used to measure fair value during the nine months ended June 30, 2019 . Marketable equity securities. Marketable equity securities are publicly traded and measured at fair value within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets. On October 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2016-01 which changed the Company’s accounting for marketable equity securities. Beginning on October 1, 2018, unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair value of marketable equity securities are recognized in non-operating income (expense). U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and U.S. Treasury securities. The Company considers U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and U.S. Treasury securities to be available-for-sale and held $ 6.1 billion and $ 7.5 billion of these investment securities as of June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018 , respectively. All of the Company’s long-term available-for-sale investment securities are due within one to five years . Derivative instruments. In March 2019, the Company entered into interest rate and cross-currency swap agreements on a portion of the Company’s outstanding 3.15 % Senior Notes due December 2025. The Company designated the interest rate swap as a fair value hedge and the cross-currency swap as a net investment hedge. Gains and losses related to changes in fair value hedges are recognized in non-operating income (expense) along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in value of the underlying hedged item in the same line in the consolidated statement of operations. The change in value of net investment hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income. Amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of net investment hedges are recognized in non-operating income (expense). Cash flows associated with derivatives designated as a fair value hedge may be included in operating, investing or financing activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows, depending on the classification of the items being hedged. Cash flows associated with financial instruments designated as net investment hedges are classified as an investing activity. There were no swap agreements outstanding as of September 30, 2018 . Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis Non-marketable equity securities. The Company’s non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. These investments are classified as Level 3 due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and the fact that inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require management’s judgment. On October 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2016-01 which changed the Company’s accounting for non-marketable equity securities. Beginning on October 1, 2018, the Company’s policy is to adjust the carrying value of its non-marketable equity securities to fair value when transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer are observable in the market. All gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities, realized and unrealized, are recognized in non-operating income (expense). Non-marketable equity securities totaled $ 679 million and $ 137 million at June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018 , respectively, and are classified in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 , upward adjustments of $ 14 million and $ 80 million , respectively, were made to the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities, and downward adjustments of $ 6 million were made during the same periods. During the nine months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 , there were no significant impairments of non-marketable equity securities. Non-financial assets and liabilities. Long-lived assets such as goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, finite-lived intangible assets and property, equipment and technology are considered non-financial assets. The Company does not have any non-financial liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, trade names and reseller relationships, all of which were obtained through acquisitions. If the Company were required to perform a quantitative assessment for impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair values would generally be estimated using an income approach. As the assumptions employed to measure these assets on a non-recurring basis are based on management’s judgment using internal and external data, these fair value determinations are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The 19 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) Company completed its annual impairment review of its indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill as of February 1, 2019, and concluded that there was no impairment. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed at June 30, 2019 . Gains and Losses on Marketable and Non-marketable Equity Securities The Company recognized net realized gains of $ 1 million and $ 16 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 , respectively, on its equity securities sold during the periods. The Company recognized net unrealized gains of $ 10 million and $ 69 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 , respectively, on equity securities held as of the end of the periods. Other Fair Value Disclosures Long-term debt. Debt instruments are measured at amortized cost on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the debt instruments, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. The pricing data obtained from outside sources is reviewed internally for reasonableness, compared against benchmark quotes from independent pricing sources, then confirmed or revised accordingly. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The carrying value and estimated fair value of long-term debt was $ 16.7 billion and $ 18.0 billion , respectively, as of June 30, 2019 . The carrying value and estimated fair value of long-term debt were both $ 16.6 billion as of September 30, 2018. Other financial instruments not measured at fair value. The following financial instruments are not measured at fair value on the Company’s unaudited consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2019 , but disclosure of their fair values is required: time deposits recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets, settlement receivable and payable and customer collateral. The estimated fair value of such instruments at June 30, 2019 approximates their carrying value due to their generally short maturities. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Note 6—Debt The Company had outstanding debt as follows: June 30, 2019 September 30, 2018 Effective Interest Rate (in millions, except percentages) 2.20% Senior Notes due December 2020 $ 3,000 $ 3,000 2.30 % 2.15% Senior Notes due September 2022 1,000 1,000 2.30 % 2.80% Senior Notes due December 2022 2,250 2,250 2.89 % 3.15% Senior Notes due December 2025 4,000 4,000 3.26 % 2.75% Senior Notes due September 2027 750 750 2.91 % 4.15% Senior Notes due December 2035 1,500 1,500 4.23 % 4.30% Senior Notes due December 2045 3,500 3,500 4.37 % 3.65% Senior Notes due September 2047 750 750 3.73 % Total senior notes 16,750 16,750 Unamortized discounts and debt issuance costs ( 111 ) ( 120 ) Hedge accounting fair value adjustments 55 — Total long-term debt $ 16,694 $ 16,630 20 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) The Company recognized interest expense for its senior notes of $ 106 million and $ 137 million for the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, and $ 350 million and $ 413 million for the nine months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Interest expense for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 includes adjustments related to the Company’s hedging program. Effective interest rates disclosed in the table above do not reflect hedge accounting adjustments. Hedge accounting adjustments impacting the carrying value of the Company’s long-term debt are a result of gains or losses related to fair value hedges. These gains or losses are recognized in earnings, along with a corresponding gain or loss related to the change in value of the underlying hedged item, within non-operating income (expense) in the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. See Note 5—Fair Value Measurements and Investments for a description of the Company’s accounting treatment for fair value hedges. Credit facility. On July 25, 2019, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement for a 5 year, unsecured $ 5.0 billion revolving credit facility (the ""Credit Facility""), which will expire on July 25, 2024. The Credit Facility is no longer governed by any financial covenants. This facility is maintained to ensure the integrity of the payment card settlement process and for general corporate purposes. Interest on borrowings under the Credit Facility will be charged at the London Interbank Offered Rate or an alternative base rate, in each case plus applicable margins that fluctuate based on the applicable credit rating of the Company's senior unsecured long-term debt. Note 7—Settlement Guarantee Management The Company indemnifies its clients for settlement losses suffered due to failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa operating rules. This indemnification creates settlement risk for the Company due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. Historically, the Company has experienced minimal losses as a result of its settlement risk guarantee. However, the Company’s future obligations, which could be material under its guarantees, are not determinable as they are dependent upon future events. The Company’s settlement exposure is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time, which vary significantly day to day. The Company’s maximum settlement exposure was $ 92.0 billion and the average daily settlement exposure was $ 56.4 billion during the nine months ended June 30, 2019 . The Company maintains and regularly reviews global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement exposure, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. At June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018 , the Company held collateral as follows: June 30, 2019 September 30, 2018 (in millions) Cash equivalents $ 1,668 $ 1,708 Pledged securities at market value 294 192 Letters of credit 1,447 1,382 Guarantees 582 860 Total $ 3,991 $ 4,142 21 Table of Contents VISA INC.

(4) Class A common stock shares outstanding reflect repurchases settled on or before June 30, 2019 and September 30, 2018 . (5) The class B to class A common stock conversion rate is presented on a rounded basis. Conversion calculations for dividend payments are based on a conversion rate rounded to the tenth decimal. Reduction in as-converted shares. Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through periodic adjustments to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the UK&I and Europe preferred stock. The recovery has the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Company’s class A common stock, because it reduces the UK&I and Europe preferred stock conversion rates and consequently, reduces the as-converted class A common stock share count. The following table presents effective price per share and recovery of VE territory covered losses through conversion rate adjustments: Nine Months Ended June 30, 2019 Twelve Months Ended September 30, 2018 Preferred Stock UK&I Europe UK&I Europe (in millions, except per share data) Effective price per share (1) $ 141.32 $ 150.26 $ 113.05 $ 112.92 Recovery through conversion rate adjustment $ 6 $ 2 $ 35 $ 21 (1) Effective price per share for the quarter is calculated using the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s class A common stock over a pricing period in accordance with the Company’s current certificates of designations for its series B and C convertible participating preferred stock.

Shares repurchased in the open market reflect repurchases settled during the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 . These amounts include repurchases traded but not yet settled on or before September 30, 2018 and 2017 for nine months, respectively, and March 31, 2019 and 2018 for three months, respectively. Also, these amounts exclude repurchases traded but not yet settled on or before June 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. (2) All shares repurchased in the open market have been retired and constitute authorized but unissued shares. (3) Average repurchase price per share is calculated based on unrounded numbers. In January 2019 , the Company’s board of directors authorized an additional $ 8.5 billion share repurchase program. As of June 30, 2019 , the Company’s January 2019 share repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $ 6.2 billion for share repurchase. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to January 2019 have been completed. Dividends. O n July 15, 2019 , the Company’s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $ 0.25 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and UK&I and Europe preferred stock on an as-converted basis). The cash dividend will be paid on September 3, 2019 , to all holders of record as of August 16, 2019 . The Company declared and paid $ 565 million and $ 487 million during the three months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, and $ 1.7 billion and $ 1.4 billion during the nine months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, in dividends to holders of the Company’s common and preferred stocks. Note 10—Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to each class of shares by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding and participating securities during the period. Net income is allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities based on its proportional ownership on an as-converted basis. The weighted-average number of shares outstanding of each class of common stock reflects changes in ownership over the periods presented. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity . Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding, participating securities and, if dilutive, potential class A common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive class A common stock equivalents may consist of: (1) shares of class A common stock issuable upon the conversion of UK&I and Europe preferred stock and class B and C common stock based on the conversion rates in effect through the period, and (2) incremental shares of class A common stock calculated by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of employee stock options, the assumed purchase of stock under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the assumed vesting of unearned performance shares.

The weighted-average number of shares of as-converted class B common stock used in the income allocation was 400 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 , and 405 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018 . The weighted-average number of shares of as-converted class C common stock used in the income allocation was 46 million and 47 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 , respectively, and 49 million and 50 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018 , respectively. The weighted-average number of shares of preferred stock included within participating securities was 32 million of as-converted UK&I preferred stock for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 . The weighted-average number of shares of preferred stock included within participating securities was 44 million of as-converted Europe preferred stock for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 . (3) Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding are calculated on an as-converted basis and include incremental common stock equivalents, as calculated under the treasury stock method. The computation includes approximately 3 million common stock equivalents for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 , because their effect would have been dilutive. The computation excludes less than 1 million of common stock equivalents for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 , because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. (4) Participating securities include preferred stock outstanding and unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, such as the Company’s UK&I and Europe preferred stock, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and earned performance-based shares. Participating securities’ income is allocated based on the weighted-average number of shares of as-converted stock. 25 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) Note 11—Share-based Compensation The Company granted the following equity awards to employees and non-employee directors under the 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan, or the EIP, during the nine months ended June 30, 2019 : Granted Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Weighted-Average Exercise Price Non-qualified stock options 1,109,645 $ 25.89 $ 134.76 Restricted stock units (“RSUs”) 2,706,680 $ 136.21 Performance-based shares (1) 540,538 $ 153.42 (1) Represents the maximum number of performance-based shares which could be earned. The Company’s non-qualified stock options and RSUs are equity awards with service-only conditions and are accordingly expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The Company’s performance-based shares are equity awards with service, market and performance conditions that are accounted for using the graded-vesting method. The Company recorded share-based compensation cost related to the EIP of $ 106 million and $ 307 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 , respectively, and $ 85 million and $ 231 million for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018 , respectively, net of estimated forfeitures, which are adjusted as appropriate. Note 12—Income Taxes The effective income tax rates were 20 % and 19 % for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 , respectively, and 17 % and 20 % for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018 , respectively. The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 differ from the effective tax rates in the same prior-year periods primarily due to the effects of U.S. tax reform legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), enacted on December 22, 2017, as discussed below: • The Tax Act reduced the statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. In fiscal 2018, the Company’s statutory federal corporate rate was a blended rate of 24.5 % . Federal tax expense for the nine months ended June 30, 2019 was determined at a 21% tax rate compared to the 24.5 % tax rate in the prior-year period; • The Tax Act enacted a new deduction for foreign-derived intangible income (“FDII”) and a new tax on global intangible low-tax income (“GILTI”). Both FDII and GILTI became effective for the Company on October 1, 2018; and • The absence of the following items recorded during the nine months ended June 30, 2018 : ▪ $ 80 million and $ 81 million benefits due to non-recurring audit settlements during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018, respectively; ▪ a $ 1.1 billion non-recurring, non-cash benefit from the remeasurement of deferred tax balances recorded in the three months ended December 31, 2017, in connection with the reduction in U.S. federal tax rate enacted by the Tax Act; and ▪ a $ 1.1 billion one-time transition tax expense on certain untaxed foreign earnings recorded in the three months ended December 31, 2017, in connection with the requirement enacted by the Tax Act . The Company previously recorded provisional amounts for the transition tax and the tax effects of various other tax provisions enacted by the Tax Act. As permitted by ASU 2018-05, the Company completed the determination of the accounting impacts of the transition tax and the tax effects of these various tax provisions in the three months ended December 31, 2018. The adjustments to the provisional amounts were not material. In addition, the Company adopted the accounting policy of accounting for taxes on GILTI in the period that it is subject to such tax. 26 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 , the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by $ 241 million and $ 387 million , respectively. The Company's net unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably impact the effective tax rate increased by $ 51 million and $ 134 million , respectively. The change in unrecognized tax benefits is primarily related to various tax positions across several jurisdictions. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 , the Company’s accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions increased by $ 19 million and $ 51 million , respectively, and there were no significant changes in penalties. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018, there were no significant changes in interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. The Company’s tax filings are subject to examination by the U.S. federal, state and foreign taxing authorities. The timing and outcome of the final resolutions of the various ongoing income tax examinations are highly uncertain. It is not reasonably possible to estimate the increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. Note 13—Legal Matters The Company is party to various legal and regulatory proceedings. Some of these proceedings involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. Accordingly, except as disclosed, the Company has not established reserves or ranges of possible loss related to these proceedings, as at this time in the proceedings, the matters do not relate to a probable loss and/or the amount or range of losses are not reasonably estimable. Although the Company believes that it has strong defenses for the litigation and regulatory proceedings described below, it could, in the future, incur judgments or fines or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. From time to time, the Company may engage in settlement discussions or mediations with respect to one or more of its outstanding litigation matters, either on its own behalf or collectively with other parties. The litigation accrual is an estimate and is based on management’s understanding of its litigation profile, the specifics of each case, advice of counsel to the extent appropriate and management’s best estimate of incurred loss as of the balance sheet date. The following table summarizes the activity related to accrued litigation: Nine Months Ended June 30, 2019 2018 (in millions) Balance at beginning of period $ 1,434 $ 982 Provision for uncovered legal matters 37 — Provision for covered legal matters 165 601 Payments for legal matters ( 780 ) ( 155 ) Balance at end of period $ 856 $ 1,428 Accrual Summary—U.S. Covered Litigation Visa Inc., Visa U.S.A. and Visa International are parties to certain legal proceedings that are covered by the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, which the Company refers to as the U.S. covered litigation. See further discussion below under U.S. Covered Litigation and Note 4—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . An accrual for the U.S. covered litigation and a charge to the litigation provision are recorded when a loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable.

Unlike the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Europe retrospective responsibility plan does not have an escrow account that is used to fund settlements or judgments. The Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through periodic adjustments to the conversion rates applicable to the UK&I preferred stock and Europe preferred stock. An accrual for the VE territory covered losses and a reduction to stockholders’ equity will be recorded when the loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable.

On June 7, 2019, the Damages Class plaintiffs moved for final approval of the Amended Settlement Agreement. Certain merchants in the proposed settlement class have objected to the settlement and/or submitted requests to opt out of the settlement class. Although the deadline to opt out of the settlement class was July 23, 2019, the class administrator has until August 7, 2019 to send the final report indicating the number of merchants that chose to opt out of the settlement class. The district court is scheduled to hold a final settlement approval hearing on November 7, 2019. Settlement discussions with plaintiffs purporting to act on behalf of the putative Injunctive Relief Class are ongoing. On January 16, 2019, the bank defendants moved to dismiss the claims brought against them by the Injunctive Relief Class, on the grounds that plaintiffs lack standing and fail to state a claim against the bank defendants. 28 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) VE Territory Covered Litigation UK Merchant Litigation Since July 2013, in excess of 500 Merchants (the capitalized term “Merchant,” when used in this section, means a merchant together with subsidiary/affiliate companies that are party to the same claim) have commenced proceedings against Visa Europe, Visa Inc. and Visa International in the UK (and recently in Germany) relating to interchange rates in Europe, and in some cases relating to fees charged by Visa and certain Visa rules. As of the filing date, Visa Europe, Visa Inc. and Visa International have settled the claims asserted by over 100 Merchants, leaving more than 350 Merchants with outstanding claims. In addition, over 30 additional Merchants have threatened to commence similar proceedings. Standstill agreements have been entered into with respect to some of those threatened Merchant claims, several of which have been settled. On November 29, 2018, Visa was granted permission to appeal aspects of the Court of Appeal’s judgment to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, including the question of whether Visa’s UK interchange restricted competition. The Supreme Court is scheduled to hold a hearing on the appeal in January 2020. Other Litigation European Commission Proceedings Inter-regional Interchange Investigation. On December 4, 2018, the European Commission (EC) announced formal public consultation (known as “market testing”) of commitments proposed by Visa pursuant to Article 9 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 in order for the EC to conclude its investigation. Subject to market testing, the EC intends to adopt a decision declaring the commitments to be binding on Visa and concluding that there are no longer grounds for action by the EC and without any finding of infringement of the law by Visa. If accepted by the EC, the proposed commitments require Visa to cap its inter-regional multilateral interchange rates at 1.50 % credit and 1.15 % debit for “Card-Not-Present” transactions and 0.30 % credit and 0.20 % debit for “Card Present” transactions on consumer debit and credit cards issued outside of the European Economic Area when used at merchants located inside of the European Economic Area. The commitments would last for a period of five years following implementation. No fine will be imposed against Visa, and the commitments are proposed without prejudice to Visa’s position that its conduct did not infringe any law. The EC’s market testing was completed in January 2019. On April 29, 2019, the EC adopted a decision making Visa’s commitments to limit interregional interchange rates in Europe binding from October 19, 2019. The commitments will remain in effect until November 1, 2024. Canadian Merchant Litigation Wal-Mart Canada and/or Home Depot of Canada Inc. have filed notices of appeal of the British Columbia, Ontario, Saskatchewan, Quebec and Alberta decisions approving the settlements. On June 13 and 14, 2019, the Court of Appeals in British Columbia held a hearing to consider objections to the settlement approval decision and reserved decision. EMV Chip Liability Shift Plaintiffs filed a renewed motion for class certification on July 16, 2018, following an earlier denial of the motion without prejudice. Plaintiffs’ renewed motion was terminated without prejudice to reinstatement on October 17, 2018, but was subsequently reinstated and is currently pending. Kroger The litigation was stayed until February 2, 2019. Visa and Kroger reached an agreement in principle to resolve this lawsuit, and subsequently entered into a settlement agreement. The case was dismissed on July 24, 2019. 29 Table of Contents VISA INC.

Financial overview. Our financial results for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018 reflected the impact of certain significant items that we believe were not indicative of our operating performance in these or future periods, as they were either non-recurring or had no cash impact. There were no comparable adjustments recorded for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 . Our as-reported U.S. GAAP and adjusted non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share for these periods were as follows: Three Months Ended June 30, 2019 vs. 2018 Nine Months Ended June 30, 2019 vs. 2018 (in millions, except percentages and per share data) 2019 2018 % Change (1) 2019 2018 % Change (1) Net income, as reported $ 3,101 $ 2,329 33 % $ 9,055 $ 7,456 21 % Diluted earnings per share, as reported $ 1.37 $ 1.00 36 % $ 3.97 $ 3.19 25 % Net income, as adjusted (2) $ 3,101 $ 2,792 11 % $ 9,055 $ 7,933 14 % Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted (2) $ 1.37 $ 1.20 14 % $ 3.97 $ 3.39 17 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. (2) For a full reconciliation of our adjusted financial results, see tables in Adjusted financial results below. Highlights for the first nine months of fiscal 2019 . Our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending. Our business performance during the nine months ended June 30, 2019 reflects continued global consumer spending growth amidst uneven global economic conditions. We recorded net revenues of $5.8 billion and $16.8 billion for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 , respectively, an increase of 11% and 11% , respectively, over the prior-year comparable periods, reflecting continued growth in nominal payments volume, nominal cross-border volume and processed transactions. Exchange rate movements in the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 , as partially mitigated by our hedging program, negatively impacted our net revenues growth by approximately two percentage points and one and a half percentage points, respectively. Total operating expenses were $1.9 billion and $5.6 billion for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 , respectively, a decrease of 18% and 1% over the prior-year comparable period. Adjusted operating expenses, which excludes the non-cash operating expense for the litigation provision related to the interchange multidistrict litigation in the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018, increased 10% and 11% , respectively, over prior-year comparable periods. The increase in both periods was primarily due to higher personnel, marketing and general and administrative expenses, as we continue to invest in our business growth. Adjusted financial results. Our financial results for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018 reflected the impact of certain significant items that we believe were not indicative of our ongoing operating performance in these or future periods, as they were either non-recurring or had no cash impact. As such, we believe the presentation of adjusted financial results excluding the following items provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the periods presented. There were no comparable adjustments recorded for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 . • Litigation provision. During the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018, we recorded a litigation provision of $600 million and related tax benefits of $137 million associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. The tax impact is determined by applying applicable federal and state tax rates to the litigation provision. Under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, we recover the monetary liabilities related to the U.S. covered litigation through a reduction to the conversion rate of our class B common stock to shares of class A common stock. See Note 4—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 13—Legal Matters to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. 32 Table of Contents • Remeasurement of deferred tax balances. During the nine months ended June 30, 2018 , in connection with the Tax Act’s reduction of the corporate income tax rate, we remeasured our net deferred tax liabilities as of the enactment date, resulting in the recognition of a non-recurring, non-cash income tax benefit of $1.1 billion . See Note 12—Income Taxes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. • Transition tax on foreign earnings. During the nine months ended June 30, 2018 , in connection with the Tax Act’s requirement that we include certain untaxed foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries in our fiscal 2018 taxable income, we recorded a one-time transition tax estimated to be approximately $1.1 billion . See Note 12—Income Taxes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Adjusted financial results are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be relied upon as substitutes for measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following table reconciles our as-reported financial measures, calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to our respective non-GAAP adjusted financial measures for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018 . There were no comparable adjustments recorded for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 .

Diluted earnings per share and its respective total are calculated based on unrounded numbers. (2) Operating margin is calculated as operating income divided by net operating revenues. Common stock repurchases. During the three months ended June 30, 2019 , we repurchased 13 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market using $2.1 billion of cash on hand. In January 2019, our board of directors authorized an additional $8.5 billion share repurchase program. As of June 30, 2019 , we had remaining authorized funds of $6.2 billion for share repurchase. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Payments volume and transaction counts. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues. During the three months ended December 31, 2018, we updated our definition of payments volume to now include all disbursement volume related to Visa Direct, in addition to the funding volume previously included. All prior periods presented have been adjusted accordingly. Please refer to the Operational Performance Data section of Exhibit 99.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on January 30, 2019 for more details on the impact from this update in payments volume definition. Nominal payments volume in the United States posted high single-digit growth for three months and low double-digit growth for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 (1) , driven mainly by consumer debit and commercial. Nominal international payments volume growth was negatively impacted by movements in the U.S. dollar exchange rates. On a constant-dollar basis, which excludes the impact of exchange rate movements, our international payments volume growth rate for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2019 was 8% and 10% , respectively. Growth in processed transactions reflects the ongoing worldwide shift to electronic payments. 33 Table of Contents The following table (2) presents nominal payments and cash volume: United States International Visa Inc.

Therefore, service revenues reported for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 and 2018 were based on nominal payments volume reported by our financial institution clients for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. (2) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes and totals are calculated based on unrounded numbers. (3) Includes consumer prepaid volume and Interlink volume. (4) Includes large, middle and small business credit and debit, as well as commercial prepaid volume. (5) Total nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume. Total nominal payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased on cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink and V PAY brands. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution clients, subject to review by Visa. On occasion, previously presented volume information may be updated. Prior-period updates, other than the change to the payments volume definition, are not material. (6) Growth on a constant-dollar basis excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar. 34 Table of Contents The following table (1) provides the number of transactions involving cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink, V PAY and PLUS cards processed on Visa’s networks during the periods presented: Three Months Ended June 30, Nine Months Ended June 30, 2019 2018 % Change 2019 2018 % Change (in millions, except percentages) Visa processed transactions 35,428 31,728 12 % 101,904 91,557 11 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

Results of Operations Net Revenues The following table sets forth our net revenues earned in the U.S. and internationally: Three Months Ended June 30, 2019 vs. 2018 Nine Months Ended June 30, 2019 vs. 2018 2019 2018 $ Change % Change (1) 2019 2018 $ Change % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) U.S. $ 2,587 $ 2,334 $ 253 11 % $ 7,573 $ 6,896 $ 677 10 % International 3,253 2,906 347 12 % 9,267 8,279 988 12 % Net revenues $ 5,840 $ 5,240 $ 600 11 % $ 16,840 $ 15,175 $ 1,665 11 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. The increase in net revenues reflects the continued growth in nominal payments volume, nominal cross-border volume and processed transactions. Our net revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. Exchange rate movements in the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 , as partially mitigated by our hedging program, negatively impacted our net revenues growth by approximately two percentage points and one and a half percentage points , respectively. The following table sets forth the components of our net revenues: Three Months Ended June 30, 2019 vs. 2018 Nine Months Ended June 30, 2019 vs. 2018 2019 2018 $ Change % Change (1) 2019 2018 $ Change % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Service revenues $ 2,405 $ 2,196 $ 209 10 % $ 7,164 $ 6,595 $ 569 9 % Data processing revenues 2,662 2,359 303 13 % 7,564 6,633 931 14 % International transaction revenues 1,977 1,830 147 8 % 5,624 5,248 376 7 % Other revenues 342 229 113 49 % 968 688 280 41 % Client incentives (1,546 ) (1,374 ) (172 ) 13 % (4,480 ) (3,989 ) (491 ) 12 % Net revenues $ 5,840 $ 5,240 $ 600 11 % $ 16,840 $ 15,175 $ 1,665 11 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. • Service revenues increased primarily due to 3% and 6% growth in nominal payments volume during the three and nine -month comparable periods, respectively, as well as select pricing modifications effective in the third quarter of fiscal 2019. • Data processing revenues increased mainly due to overall growth in processed transactions of 12% and 11% during the three and nine -month comparable periods, respectively, as well as select pricing modifications impacting revenue growth in the first and second quarter of fiscal 2019. 35 Table of Contents • International transaction revenues increased due to a 2% and 1% growth in nominal cross-border volumes during the three and nine -month comparable periods, respectively, select pricing modifications effective after the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and changes in the mix of our international transaction revenues. These increases were partially offset by lower volatility in a broad range of currencies. • Other revenues increased during the three and nine -month comparable periods primarily due to changes in the classification and timing of recognition of revenue as a result of the adoption of the new revenue standard as well as an increase in revenues from license fees and optional services. • Client incentives increased during the three and nine -month comparable periods mainly due to incentives recognized on long-term customer contracts that were initiated or renewed after the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and overall growth in global payments volume. Client incentives also increased due to changes in classification and timing of recognition as a result of the adoption of the new revenue standard. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or execution of new contracts. Operating Expenses The following table sets forth components of our total operating expenses: Three Months Ended June 30, 2019 vs. 2018 Nine Months Ended June 30, 2019 vs. 2018 2019 2018 $ Change % Change (1) 2019 2018 $ Change % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Personnel $ 872 $ 852 $ 20 2 % $ 2,573 $ 2,355 $ 218 9 % Marketing 282 240 42 18 % 799 724 75 10 % Network and processing 184 169 15 9 % 528 498 30 6 % Professional fees 113 112 1 1 % 305 312 (7 ) (2 )% Depreciation and amortization 165 152 13 9 % 484 450 34 8 % General and administrative 315 230 85 37 % 855 688 167 24 % Litigation provision 1 600 (599 ) (100 )% 30 600 (570 ) (95 )% Total operating expenses $ 1,932 $ 2,355 $ (423 ) (18 )% $ 5,574 $ 5,627 $ (53 ) (1 )% (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. • Personnel expenses increased primarily due to an increase in headcount, reflecting our strategy to invest for future growth. • Marketing expenses increased in the three and nine month comparable periods primarily due to changes in the classification and timing of recognition of certain marketing expenses as a result of the adoption of the new revenue standard. The increase was partially offset in the nine month comparable period by spend for the Winter Olympics in PyeongChang in 2018, which did not recur in 2019. • General and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations, changes in the classification and timing of recognition of certain general and administrative expenses as a result of the adoption of the new revenue standard, higher indirect taxes, and higher product enhancement costs in support of our business growth. • Litigation provision in 2018 reflects a $600 million accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation.

Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. • Interest expense decreased in the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 primarily as a result of entering into derivative instruments in fiscal 2019 that lowered the cost of borrowing on a portion of our outstanding debt. • Investment income and other increased in the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 primarily due to higher interest income on our cash and investments as well as gains on our equity investments. Effective Income Tax Rate The effective income tax rates were 20% and 19% for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 , respectively, and 17% and 20% for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018, respectively. The effective tax rates for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019 differ from the effective tax rates in the same prior-year periods primarily due to the effects of the Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017, as discussed below: • The Tax Act reduced the statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. In fiscal 2018, our statutory federal corporate rate was a blended rate of 24.5%. Federal tax expense for the nine months ended June 30, 2019 was determined at a 21% tax rate compared to the 24.5% tax rate in the prior-year period; • The Tax Act enacted a new deduction for foreign-derived intangible income (“FDII”) and a new tax on global intangible low-tax income (“GILTI”). Both FDII and GILTI became effective for us on October 1, 2018; and • The absence of the following items recorded during the nine months ended June 30, 2018: ▪ $80 million and $81 million benefits due to non-recurring audit settlements during the three months ended March 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018, respectively; ▪ a $1.1 billion non-recurring, non-cash benefit from the remeasurement of deferred tax balances recorded in the three months ended December 31, 2017, in connection with the reduction in U.S. federal tax rate enacted by the Tax Act; and ▪ a $1.1 billion one-time transition tax expense on certain untaxed foreign earnings recorded in the three months ended December 31, 2017, in connection with the requirement enacted by the Tax Act . We previously recorded provisional amounts for the transition tax and the tax effects of various other tax provisions enacted by the Tax Act. As permitted by ASU 2018-05, we completed the determination of the accounting impacts of the transition tax and the tax effects of these various tax provisions in the three months ended December 31, 2018. The adjustments to the provisional amounts were not material. In addition, we adopted the accounting policy of accounting for taxes on GILTI in the period that it is subject to such tax. Adjusted effective income tax rate. Our financial results for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2018 reflect the impact of certain significant items that we believe were not indicative of our operating performance during these periods, as they were either non-recurring or had no cash impact. As such, we have presented our adjusted effective income tax rates for these periods in the table below, which we believe provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the reported periods. There were no comparable adjustments recorded for the three and nine months ended June 30, 2019. See Overview—Adjusted financial results within this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for descriptions of the adjustments in the table below. 37 Table of Contents Three Months Ended June 30, 2018 Nine Months Ended June 30, 2018 (in millions, except percentages) Income Before Income Taxes Income Tax Provision Effective Income Tax Rate (1) Income Before Income Taxes Income Tax Provision Effective Income Tax Rate (1) As reported $ 2,812 $ 483 17.2 % $ 9,268 $ 1,812 19.5 % Litigation provision 600 137 600 137 Remeasurement of deferred tax balances — — — 1,133 Transition tax on foreign earnings — — — (1,147 ) As adjusted $ 3,412 $ 620 18.2 % $ 9,868 $ 1,935 19.6 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Data The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the periods presented: Nine Months Ended June 30, 2019 2018 (in millions) Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 8,742 $ 9,465 Investing activities 413 (1,305 ) Financing activities (9,401 ) (8,744 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (62 ) (89 ) Decrease in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents $ (308 ) $ (673 ) Operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended June 30, 2019 was lower than the prior-year comparable period primarily due to higher payments from the litigation escrow account in the current year and the first installment payment of the transition tax in connection with the Tax Act, partially offset by continued growth in our underlying business. Investing activities. Cash provided by investing activities for the nine months ended June 30, 2019 primarily included higher proceeds from the sales and maturities of investment securities, combined with fewer purchases, as compared to the prior-year period. Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended June 30, 2019 was higher than the prior-year comparable period primarily due to the payment of the deferred purchase consideration, increase in the repurchases of our class A common stock and higher dividends paid in the current year. This increase was partially offset by the redemption of the Senior Notes due December 2017 in the prior year. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements . Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings and the returns that these holdings provide. Based on our current cash flow forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our current and projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances. 38 Table of Contents Credit facility extension. On July 25, 2019, we extended the term of our 5-year, unsecured revolving credit facility and increased the amount from $4.0 billion to $5.0 billion. The credit facility will expire on July 25, 2024. The credit facility is no longer governed by any financial covenants. No other material terms were changed. See Note 6—Debt to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Credit Ratings During the nine months ended June 30, 2019 , our credit ratings by Standard and Poor’s and Moody’s were upgraded to the following as compared to September 30, 2018 : June 30, 2019 September 30, 2018 Rating Agency and Debt type Rating Outlook Rating Outlook Standard and Poor’s Short-term unsecured debt A-1+ Stable A-1 Positive Long-term unsecured debt AA- Stable A+ Positive Moody’s Long-term unsecured debt Aa3 Stable A1 Stable Various factors affect our credit ratings, including changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the electronic payment industry, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a significant downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets. Uses of Liquidity There has been no significant change to our primary uses of liquidity since September 30, 2018 , except as discussed below. Common stock repurchases. During the nine months ended June 30, 2019 , we repurchased 44 million shares of our class A common stock using $6.5 billion of cash on hand. In January 2019, our board of directors authorized an additional $8.5 billion share repurchase program. As of June 30, 2019 , we had remaining authorized funds of $6.2 billion for share repurchase. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to January 2019 have been completed. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Dividends . During the nine months ended June 30, 2019 , we declared and paid $1.7 billion in dividends to holders of our common and preferred stock. On July 15, 2019 , our board of directors declared a cash dividend in the amount of $0.25 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and UK&I and Europe preferred stock on an as-converted basis), which will be paid on September 3, 2019 , to all holders of record as of August 16, 2019 . See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. All three series of preferred stock and class B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends. Deferred purchase consideration. In connection with our purchase of Visa Europe in June 2016, we were required to pay an additional €1.0 billion, plus 4% compound annual interest, on the third anniversary of the closing of the acquisition. In June 2019, we paid €1.1 billion in fulfillment of this obligation. Derivative Financial Instruments In March 2019, we entered into interest rate and cross-currency swap agreements on a portion of our outstanding 3.15% Senior Notes due December 2025 that allows us to manage our interest rate exposure through a combination of fixed and floating rates and reduce our overall cost of borrowing. Together these swap agreements effectively convert a portion of our U.S. dollar denominated fixed-rate payments into euro denominated floating-rate payments. See Note 5—Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Fair Value Measurements—Financial Instruments As of June 30, 2019 , our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included $12.7 billion of assets and $74 million of liabilities. See Note 5—Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk There has been no significant change to our market risks since September 30, 2018 , except as discussed below. In March 2019, we entered into interest rate and cross-currency swap agreements on a portion of our outstanding senior notes that allows us to manage our interest rate exposure through a combination of fixed and floating rates and reduce our overall cost of borrowing. Together these swap agreements effectively convert a portion of our U.S. dollar denominated fixed-rate payments into euro denominated floating-rate payments. By entering into interest rate swaps, we have assumed risks associated with market interest rate fluctuations. See Note 5—Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) of Visa Inc. at the end of the period covered by this report and, based on such evaluation, have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures of Visa Inc. were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of such date. Changes in internal control over financial reporting. During the nine months ended June 30, 2019 , the Company implemented a new client incentives accounting system along with enhancements and modifications to existing internal controls and procedures to comply with the new revenue standard . There have been no other changes in the internal control over financial reporting of Visa Inc. that occurred during the fiscal period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 40 Table of Contents PART II.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS March 31, 2019 (UNAUDITED) Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Organization. Visa Inc. (“Visa” or the “Company”) is a global payments technology company that enables fast, secure and reliable electronic payments across more than 200 countries and territories. Visa and its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries, including Visa U.S.A. Inc. (“Visa U.S.A.”), Visa International Service Association (“Visa International”), Visa Worldwide Pte. Limited, Visa Europe Limited (“Visa Europe”), Visa Canada Corporation (“Visa Canada”), Visa Technology & Operations LLC and CyberSource Corporation, operate one of the world’s largest retail electronic payments networks — VisaNet — which facilitates authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and enables the Company to provide its financial institution and merchant clients a wide range of products, platforms and value-added services. VisaNet also offers fraud protection for account holders and assured payment for merchants. Visa is not a bank and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders on Visa products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, Visa’s financial institution clients. Consolidation and basis of presentation. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The Company consolidates its majority-owned and controlled entities, including variable interest entities (“VIEs”) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company’s investments in VIEs have not been material to its consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirements for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and, consequently, do not include all of the annual disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. Reference should be made to the Visa Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2018 for additional disclosures, including a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements. In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of goods or services to customers. This new revenue standard replaces all existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP. Subsequently, the FASB also issued a series of amendments to the new revenue standard. The new revenue standard changes the classification and timing of recognition of certain client incentives and marketing-related funds paid to customers, as well as revenues and expenses for market development funds and services provided to customers as an incentive. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method applied to the aggregate of all modifications for contracts not completed as of October 1, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning after October 1, 2018 are presented under the new revenue standard. The comparative prior period amounts appearing on the financial statements have not been restated and continue to be reported under the prior revenue standard. See Note 2—Revenues for the impact of the new revenue standard on the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 . 11 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) The following table summarizes the cumulative transition adjustments for the adoption of the new revenue standard recorded on the October 1, 2018 consolidated balance sheet to reflect the aggregate impact to all contracts not completed as of October 1, 2018: Fiscal Year 2018 Closing Balance Sheet Cumulative Transition Adjustment for New Revenue Standard Fiscal Year 2019 Opening Balance Sheet (in millions) Assets Current portion of client incentives $ 340 $ 199 $ 539 Client incentives 538 614 1,152 Liabilities Client incentives 2,834 241 3,075 Accrued liabilities 1,160 6 1,166 Deferred tax liabilities 4,618 108 4,726 Other liabilities 2,666 58 2,724 Equity Accumulated income 11,318 400 11,718 In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, which amends certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments, including the requirement to measure certain equity investments at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective transition method for marketable equity securities and the prospective method for non-marketable equity securities. The Company has elected to use the measurement alternative for non-marketable equity securities, defined as cost adjusted for changes from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer, less impairment. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities arising from operating leases on the balance sheet. Subsequently, the FASB also issued a series of amendments to this new lease standard that address the transition methods available and clarify the guidance for lessor costs and other aspects of the new lease standard. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2019 and expects to adopt using the modified retrospective transition method without restating comparative periods. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, which requires that entities recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2018. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, which requires that a statement of cash flows includes the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2018. The adoption impacted the presentation of transactions related to the U.S. litigation escrow account and customer collateral on the consolidated statements of cash flows. The prior period statement of cash flows have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the impact of this ASU, which had no impact on the Company’s balance sheets, statements of operations or statements of comprehensive income for any period. 12 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, which requires that the service cost component of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost be presented in the same line item as other employee compensation costs, while the other components be presented separately as non-operating income (expense). In addition, only the service cost component is eligible for capitalization, when applicable. Retrospective application is required for the change in income statement presentation while the change in capitalized benefit cost is required to be applied prospectively. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2018, which did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. The service cost component of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost is presented in personnel expenses while the other components are presented in other non-operating expense on the Company’s consolidated statement of operations. The Company did not apply the standard retrospectively for the change in income statement presentation as the impact would have been immaterial. In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, which amends the scope of modification accounting for share-based payment arrangements. Specifically, an entity would not apply modification accounting if the fair value, vesting conditions, and classification of the awards are the same immediately before and after the modification. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2018. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-12, which improves the financial reporting of hedging instruments to better portray the economic results of an entity’s risk management activities in its financial statements. Visa early adopted the standard effective January 1, 2019, which did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, which aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2018. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Note 2—Revenues Impact of the New Revenue Standard The following tables summarize the impact of the new revenue standard on the Company’s consolidated statement of operations for the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 and the consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2019 : For the Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 For the Six Months Ended March 31, 2019 As Reported Impact of the New Revenue Standard Results Under Prior Revenue Standard As Reported Impact of the New Revenue Standard Results Under Prior Revenue Standard (in millions) Net revenues $ 5,494 $ (39 ) $ 5,455 $ 11,000 $ (91 ) $ 10,909 Operating Expenses Marketing 241 (39 ) 202 517 (69 ) 448 Professional fees 101 (3 ) 98 192 (6 ) 186 General and administrative 264 (7 ) 257 540 (10 ) 530 Total operating expenses 1,853 (49 ) 1,804 3,642 (85 ) 3,557 Operating income 3,641 10 3,651 7,358 (6 ) 7,352 Income before income taxes 3,677 10 3,687 7,307 (6 ) 7,301 Income tax provision 700 2 702 1,353 1 1,354 Net income 2,977 8 2,985 5,954 (7 ) 5,947 13 Table of Contents VISA INC.

The following tables disaggregate the Company’s net revenues by revenue category and by geography for the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 : Three Months Ended March 31, Six Months Ended March 31, 2019 2018 2019 2018 (in millions) Service revenues $ 2,417 $ 2,253 $ 4,759 $ 4,399 Data processing revenues 2,432 2,127 4,902 4,274 International transaction revenues 1,796 1,752 3,647 3,418 Other revenues 327 230 626 459 Client incentives (1,478 ) (1,289 ) (2,934 ) (2,615 ) Net revenues $ 5,494 $ 5,073 $ 11,000 $ 9,935 Three Months Ended March 31, Six Months Ended March 31, 2019 2018 2019 2018 (in millions) U.S. $ 2,479 $ 2,297 $ 4,987 $ 4,562 International 3,015 2,776 6,013 5,373 Net revenues $ 5,494 $ 5,073 $ 11,000 $ 9,935 Revenue recognition. The Company's net revenues are comprised principally of the following categories: service revenues, data processing revenues, international transaction revenues, and other revenues, reduced by costs incurred under client incentives arrangements. As a payment network service provider, the Company’s obligation to the customer is to stand ready to provide continuous access to our payment network over the contractual term. Consideration is variable based primarily upon the amount and type of transactions and payments volume on Visa’s products. The Company recognizes revenues, net of sales and other similar taxes, as the payment network services are performed. Fixed fees for payment network services are generally recognized ratably over the related service period. The Company has elected the optional exemption to not disclose the remaining performance obligations related to payment network services. 14 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) Service revenues consist of revenues earned for services provided in support of client usage of Visa products. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current pricing applied to the prior quarter's payments volume. The Company also earns revenues from assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives, which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted. Data processing revenues consist of revenues earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among the Company's clients globally. Data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are performed. International transaction revenues are earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer is different from that of the merchant. International transaction revenues are primarily generated by cross-border payments and cash volume. Other revenues consist mainly of license fees for use of the Visa brand, fees for account holder services, licensing and certification and other activities related to the Company's acquired entities. Other revenues also include optional services or product enhancements, such as extended account holder protection and concierge services. Other revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are performed. Client incentives. The Company enters into long-term contracts with financial institution clients, merchants and strategic partners for various programs designed to increase revenues recognized by growing payments volume, increasing Visa product acceptance, winning merchant routing transactions over to Visa's network and driving innovation. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to revenues or as operating expenses if the payment is in exchange for a distinct good or service provided by the customer. The Company generally capitalizes upfront and fixed incentive payments under these agreements and amortizes the amounts as a reduction to revenues ratably over the contractual term. Incentives that are earned by the customer based on performance targets are recorded as reductions to revenues based on management's estimate of each client's future performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted, as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. Note 3—Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents The Company’s cash and cash equivalents include cash and certain highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are primarily recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their generally short maturities. The Company defines restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents as cash and cash equivalents that cannot be withdrawn or used for general operating activities.

The escrow funds are held in money market investments along with interest income earned, less applicable taxes, and are classified as restricted cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets. The balance of the escrow account was $899 million at March 31, 2019 and $1.5 billion at September 30, 2018 . The Company paid $600 million from the litigation escrow account during the three months ended March 31, 2019 . See Note 13—Legal Matters . The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the litigation escrow account balance. The Company did not record an additional accrual for the U.S. covered litigation during the six months ended March 31, 2019 . See Note 13—Legal Matters . Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plan Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rates in the Visa Europe territory (the “VE territory covered litigation”). Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover certain losses resulting from VE territory covered litigation (the “VE territory covered losses”) through a periodic adjustment to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the UK&I and Europe preferred stock. VE territory covered losses are recorded in “right to recover for covered losses” within equity before the corresponding adjustment to the applicable conversion rate is effected. Adjustments to the conversion rate may be executed once in any six-month period unless a single, individual loss greater than € 20 million is incurred, in which case, the six-month limitation does not apply. When the adjustment to the conversion rate is made, the amount previously recorded in “right to recover for covered losses” as contra-equity is then recorded against the book value of the preferred stock within stockholders’ equity. During the six months ended March 31, 2019 , the Company recovered $6 million of VE territory covered losses through adjustments to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the UK&I and Europe preferred stock. The conversion rates applicable to the UK&I and Europe preferred stock were reduced from 12.955 and 13.888 , respectively, as of September 30, 2018 to 12.939 and 13.886 , respectively, as of March 31, 2019 . The following table sets forth the activities related to VE territory covered losses in preferred stock and “right to recover for covered losses” within equity during the six months ended March 31, 2019 . VE territory covered losses incurred reflect settlements with merchants and additional legal costs. See Note 13—Legal Matters .

Note 5—Fair Value Measurements and Investments Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Fair Value Measurements Using Inputs Considered as Level 1 Level 2 March 31, 2019 September 30, 2018 March 31, 2019 September 30, 2018 (in millions) Assets Cash equivalents and restricted cash equivalents: Money market funds $ 6,089 $ 6,252 U.S. government-sponsored debt securities $ 200 $ 1,048 Investment securities: Marketable equity securities 157 113 U.S. government-sponsored debt securities 5,482 5,008 U.S. Treasury securities 1,743 2,508 Other current and non-current assets: Derivative instruments 166 78 Total $ 7,989 $ 8,873 $ 5,848 $ 6,134 Liabilities Accrued and other liabilities: Derivative instruments $ 44 $ 22 Total $ — $ — $ 44 $ 22 There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 assets during the six months ended March 31, 2019 . Level 1 assets. Money market funds, publicly-traded equity securities and U.S. Treasury securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets. 17 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) Level 2 assets and liabilities. The fair value of U.S. government-sponsored debt securities, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. The pricing data obtained from outside sources is reviewed internally for reasonableness, compared against benchmark quotes from independent pricing sources, then confirmed or revised accordingly. Derivative instruments are valued using inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. There were no substantive changes to the valuation techniques and related inputs used to measure fair value during the six months ended March 31, 2019 . Marketable equity securities. Marketable equity securities are publicly traded and measured at fair value within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets. On October 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2016-01 which changed the Company’s accounting for marketable equity securities. Beginning on October 1, 2018, unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair value of marketable equity securities are recognized in non-operating income (expense). U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and U.S. Treasury securities. The Company considers U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and U.S. Treasury securities to be available-for-sale and held $7.2 billion and $7.5 billion of these investment securities as of March 31, 2019 and September 30, 2018 , respectively. All of the Company’s long-term available-for-sale investment securities are due within one to five years. Derivative instruments. During the three months ended March 31, 2019 , the Company entered into interest rate and cross-currency swap agreements on a portion of the Company’s outstanding 3.15% Senior Notes due December 2025. The Company designated the interest rate swap as a fair value hedge and the cross-currency swap as a net investment hedge. Gains and losses related to changes in fair value hedges are recognized in non-operating income (expense) along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in value of the underlying hedged item in the same line in the consolidated statement of operations. The effective portions of net investment hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income. Amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of net investment hedges are recognized in non-operating income (expense). Cash flows associated with derivatives designated as a fair value hedge may be included in operating, investing or financing activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows, depending on the classification of the items being hedged. Cash flows associated with financial instruments designated as net investment hedges are classified as an investing activity. There were no swap agreements outstanding as of September 30, 2018 . Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis Non-marketable equity securities. The Company’s non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. These investments are classified as Level 3 due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and the fact that inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require management’s judgment. On October 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2016-01 which changed the Company’s accounting for non-marketable equity securities. Beginning on October 1, 2018, the Company’s policy is to adjust the carrying value of its non-marketable equity securities to fair value when transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer are observable in the market. All gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities, realized and unrealized, are recognized in non-operating income (expense). Non-marketable equity securities totaled $438 million and $137 million at March 31, 2019 and September 30, 2018 , respectively, and are classified in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. During the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 , $66 million of upward adjustments and no downward adjustments were made to the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities. During the six months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 , there were no significant impairments of non-marketable equity securities. Non-financial assets and liabilities. Long-lived assets such as goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, finite-lived intangible assets and property, equipment and technology are considered non-financial assets. The Company does not have any non-financial liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, trade names and reseller relationships, all of which were obtained through acquisitions. If the Company were required to perform a quantitative assessment for impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair values would generally be estimated using an income approach. As the assumptions employed to measure these assets on a non-recurring basis are based on management’s judgment using internal and external data, these fair value determinations are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The 18 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) Company completed its annual impairment review of its indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill as of February 1, 2019, and concluded that there was no impairment. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed at March 31, 2019 . Gains and Losses on Marketable and Non-marketable Equity Securities The Company recognized net realized gains of $15 million for both the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 on its equity securities sold during the periods. The Company recognized net unrealized gains of $79 million and $59 million for the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 , respectively, on equity securities held as of the end of the periods. Other Fair Value Disclosures Long-term debt. Debt instruments are measured at amortized cost on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the debt instruments, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. The pricing data obtained from outside sources is reviewed internally for reasonableness, compared against benchmark quotes from independent pricing sources, then confirmed or revised accordingly. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The carrying value and estimated fair value of long-term debt was $16.6 billion and $17.3 billion , respectively, as of March 31, 2019 . The carrying value and estimated fair value of long-term debt were both $16.6 billion as of September 30, 2018. Other financial instruments not measured at fair value. The following financial instruments are not measured at fair value on the Company’s unaudited consolidated balance sheet at March 31, 2019 , but disclosure of their fair values is required: time deposits recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets, settlement receivable and payable and customer collateral. The estimated fair value of such instruments at March 31, 2019 approximates their carrying value due to their generally short maturities. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.

Interest expense for the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 includes adjustments related to the Company’s hedging program. Effective interest rates disclosed in the table above do not reflect hedge accounting adjustments. 19 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) Note 7—Settlement Guarantee Management The Company indemnifies its clients for settlement losses suffered due to failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa operating rules. This indemnification creates settlement risk for the Company due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. Historically, the Company has experienced minimal losses as a result of its settlement risk guarantee. However, the Company’s future obligations, which could be material under its guarantees, are not determinable as they are dependent upon future events. The Company’s settlement exposure is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time, which vary significantly day to day. The Company’s maximum settlement exposure was $92.0 billion and the average daily settlement exposure was $55.3 billion during the six months ended March 31, 2019 . The Company maintains and regularly reviews global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement exposure, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. At March 31, 2019 and September 30, 2018 , the Company held collateral as follows: March 31, 2019 September 30, 2018 (in millions) Cash equivalents $ 1,735 $ 1,708 Pledged securities at market value 307 192 Letters of credit 1,337 1,382 Guarantees 574 860 Total $ 3,953 $ 4,142 Note 8—Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits The Company sponsors various qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans that provide for retirement and medical benefits for all eligible employees residing in the United States.

(5) The class B to class A common stock conversion rate is presented on a rounded basis. Conversion calculations for dividend payments are based on a conversion rate rounded to the tenth decimal. Reduction in as-converted shares. Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through periodic adjustments to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the UK&I and Europe preferred stock. The recovery has the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Company’s class A common stock, because it reduces the UK&I and Europe preferred stock conversion rates and consequently, reduces the as-converted class A common stock share count. 21 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) The following table presents effective price per share and recovery of VE territory covered losses through conversion rate adjustments: Six Months Ended March 31, 2019 Twelve Months Ended September 30, 2018 Preferred Stock UK&I Europe UK&I Europe (in millions, except per share data) Effective price per share (1) $ 137.19 $ 137.19 $ 113.05 $ 112.92 Recovery through conversion rate adjustment $ 5 $ 1 $ 35 $ 21 (1) Effective price per share for the quarter is calculated using the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s class A common stock over a pricing period in accordance with the Company’s current certificates of designations for its series B and C convertible participating preferred stock.

Shares repurchased in the open market reflect repurchases settled during the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 . These amounts include repurchases traded but not yet settled on or before September 30, 2018 and 2017 for six months, respectively, and December 31, 2018 and 2017 for three months, respectively. Also, these amounts exclude repurchases traded but not yet settled on or before March 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. (2) All shares repurchased in the open market have been retired and constitute authorized but unissued shares. (3) Average repurchase price per share is calculated based on unrounded numbers. In January 2019 , the Company’s board of directors authorized an additional $8.5 billion share repurchase program. As of March 31, 2019 , the Company’s January 2019 share repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $8.4 billion for share repurchase. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to January 2019 have been completed. Dividends. O n April 16, 2019 , the Company’s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and UK&I and Europe preferred stock on an as-converted basis). The cash dividend will be paid on June 4, 2019 , to all holders of record as of May 17, 2019 . The Company declared and paid $569 million and $490 million during the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, and $1.1 billion and $948 million during the six months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 , respectively, in dividends to holders of the Company’s common and preferred stocks. Note 10—Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to each class of shares by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding and participating securities during the period. Net income is allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities based on its proportional ownership on an as-converted basis. The weighted-average number of shares outstanding of each class of common stock reflects changes in ownership over the periods presented. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity . 22 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding, participating securities and, if dilutive, potential class A common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive class A common stock equivalents may consist of: (1) shares of class A common stock issuable upon the conversion of UK&I and Europe preferred stock and class B and C common stock based on the conversion rates in effect through the period, and (2) incremental shares of class A common stock calculated by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of employee stock options, the assumed purchase of stock under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the assumed vesting of unearned performance shares.

Earnings per share is calculated based on unrounded numbers. (2) Net income is allocated based on proportional ownership on an as-converted basis. The weighted-average number of shares of as-converted class B common stock used in the income allocation was 400 million for the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 , and 405 million for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 . The weighted-average number of shares of as-converted class C common stock used in the income allocation was 47 million for the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 , and 49 million and 50 million for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 , respectively. The weighted-average number of shares of preferred stock included within participating securities was 32 million of as-converted UK&I preferred stock for the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 , and 44 million of as-converted Europe preferred stock for the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 . (3) Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding are calculated on an as-converted basis and include incremental common stock equivalents, as calculated under the treasury stock method. The computation includes approximately 3 million common stock equivalents for the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 and 4 million common stock equivalents for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 , because their effect would have been dilutive. The computation excludes 1 million of common stock equivalents for the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 , and 2 million of common stock equivalents for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 , because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. (4) Participating securities include preferred stock outstanding and unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, such as the Company’s UK&I and Europe preferred stock, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and earned performance-based shares. Participating securities’ income is allocated based on the weighted-average number of shares of as-converted stock. Note 11—Share-based Compensation The Company granted the following equity awards to employees and non-employee directors under the 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan, or the EIP, during the six months ended March 31, 2019 : Granted Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Weighted-Average Exercise Price Non-qualified stock options 1,109,645 $ 25.89 $ 134.76 Restricted stock units (“RSUs”) 2,616,550 $ 135.19 Performance-based shares (1) 540,538 $ 153.42 (1) Represents the maximum number of performance-based shares which could be earned. The Company’s non-qualified stock options and RSUs are equity awards with service-only conditions and are accordingly expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The Company’s performance-based shares are equity awards with service, market and performance conditions that are accounted for using the graded-vesting method. The Company recorded share-based compensation cost related to the EIP of $106 million and $201 million for the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 , respectively, and $82 million and $146 million for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 , respectively, net of estimated forfeitures, which are adjusted as appropriate. 24 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) Note 12—Income Taxes The effective income tax rate was 19% for the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 , and 19% and 21% for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018 , respectively. The effective tax rate for the six months ended March 31, 2019 differs from the effective tax rate in the same prior-year period primarily due to the effects of U.S. tax reform legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), enacted on December 22, 2017, as discussed below: • The Tax Act reduced the statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. In fiscal 2018, the Company’s statutory federal corporate rate was a blended rate of 24.5% . Federal tax expense for the six months ended March 31, 2019 was determined at a 21% tax rate compared to the 24.5% tax rate in the prior-year period; • The Tax Act enacted a new deduction for foreign-derived intangible income (“FDII”) and a new tax on global intangible low-tax income (“GILTI”). Both FDII and GILTI became effective for the Company on October 1, 2018; and • The absence of the following items recorded during the six months ended March 31, 2018 : ▪ an $80 million benefit due to a non-recurring audit settlement during the three months ended March 31, 2018; ▪ a $1.1 billion non-recurring, non-cash benefit from the remeasurement of deferred tax balances recorded in the three months ended December 31, 2017, in connection with the reduction in U.S. federal tax rate enacted by the Tax Act; and ▪ a $1.1 billion one-time transition tax expense on certain untaxed foreign earnings recorded in the three months ended December 31, 2017, in connection with the requirement enacted by the Tax Act . The Company previously recorded provisional amounts for the transition tax and the tax effects of various other tax provisions enacted by the Tax Act. As permitted by ASU 2018-05, the Company completed the determination of the accounting impacts of the transition tax and the tax effects of these various tax provisions in the three months ended December 31, 2018. The adjustments to the provisional amounts were not material. In addition, the Company adopted the accounting policy of accounting for taxes on GILTI in the period that it is subject to such tax. During the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 , the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by $108 million and $146 million , respectively. The Company's unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably impact the effective tax rate increased by $44 million and $83 million , respectively. The change in unrecognized tax benefits is primarily related to various tax positions across several jurisdictions. During the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 , there were no significant changes in interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. The Company’s tax filings are subject to examination by the U.S. federal, state and foreign taxing authorities. The timing and outcome of the final resolutions of the various ongoing income tax examinations are highly uncertain. It is not reasonably possible to estimate the increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. Note 13—Legal Matters The Company is party to various legal and regulatory proceedings. Some of these proceedings involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. Accordingly, except as disclosed, the Company has not established reserves or ranges of possible loss related to these proceedings, as at this time in the proceedings, the matters do not relate to a probable loss and/or the amount or range of losses are not reasonably estimable. Although the Company believes that it has strong defenses for the litigation and regulatory proceedings described below, it could, in the future, incur judgments or fines or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. From time to time, the Company may engage in settlement discussions or mediations with respect to one or more of its outstanding litigation matters, either on its own behalf or collectively with other parties. 25 Table of Contents VISA INC.

See further discussion below under U.S. Covered Litigation and Note 4—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . An accrual for the U.S. covered litigation and a charge to the litigation provision are recorded when a loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. In making this determination, the Company evaluates available information, including but not limited to actions taken by the litigation committee. The total accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the escrow account balance.

Unlike the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Europe retrospective responsibility plan does not have an escrow account that is used to fund settlements or judgments. The Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through periodic adjustments to the conversion rates applicable to the UK&I preferred stock and Europe preferred stock. An accrual for the VE territory covered losses and a reduction to stockholders’ equity will be recorded when the loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable.

Settlement discussions with plaintiffs purporting to act on behalf of the putative Injunctive Relief Class are ongoing. On January 16, 2019, the bank defendants moved to dismiss the claims brought against them by the Injunctive Relief Class, on the grounds that plaintiffs lack standing and fail to state a claim against the bank defendants. VE Territory Covered Litigation UK Merchant Litigation Since July 2013, in excess of 450 Merchants (the capitalized term “Merchant,” when used in this section, means a merchant together with subsidiary/affiliate companies that are party to the same claim) have commenced proceedings against Visa Europe, Visa Inc. and Visa International relating to interchange rates in Europe, and in some cases relating to fees charged by Visa and certain Visa rules. As of the filing date, Visa Europe, Visa Inc. and Visa International have settled the claims asserted by over 100 Merchants, leaving more than 350 Merchants with outstanding claims. In addition, over 30 additional Merchants have threatened to commence similar proceedings. Standstill agreements have been entered into with respect to some of those threatened Merchant claims, several of which have been settled. On November 29, 2018, Visa was granted permission to appeal aspects of the Court of Appeal’s judgment to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, including the question of whether Visa’s UK interchange restricted competition . Other Litigation European Commission Proceedings Inter-regional Interchange Investigation. On December 4, 2018, the European Commission (EC) announced formal public consultation (known as “market testing”) of commitments proposed by Visa pursuant to Article 9 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 in order for the EC to conclude its investigation. Subject to market testing, the EC intends to adopt a decision declaring the commitments to be binding on Visa and concluding that there are no longer grounds for action by the EC and without any finding of infringement of the law by Visa. If accepted by the EC, the proposed commitments require Visa to cap its inter-regional multilateral interchange rates at 1.50% credit and 1.15% debit for “Card-Not-Present” transactions and 0.30% credit and 0.20% debit for “Card Present” transactions on consumer debit and credit cards issued outside of the European Economic Area when used at merchants located inside of the European Economic Area. The commitments would last for a period of five years following implementation. No fine will be imposed against Visa, and the commitments are proposed without prejudice to Visa’s position that its conduct did not infringe any law. The EC’s market testing was completed in January 2019, and the EC is expected to decide whether to formally adopt the proposed commitments in the first half of calendar year 2019. 27 Table of Contents VISA INC.

Financial overview. Our financial results for the six months ended March 31, 2018 reflected the impact of certain significant items that we believe were not indicative of our operating performance in these or future periods, as they were either non-recurring or had no cash impact. There were no comparable adjustments recorded for the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 and the three months ended March 31, 2018 . Our as-reported U.S. GAAP and adjusted non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share for these periods were as follows: Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 vs. 2018 Six Months Ended March 31, 2019 vs. 2018 (in millions, except percentages and per share data) 2019 2018 % Change (1) 2019 2018 % Change (1) Net income, as reported $ 2,977 $ 2,605 14 % $ 5,954 $ 5,127 16 % Diluted earnings per share, as reported $ 1.31 $ 1.11 17 % $ 2.61 $ 2.19 19 % Net income, as adjusted (2) $ 2,977 $ 2,605 14 % $ 5,954 $ 5,141 16 % Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted (2) $ 1.31 $ 1.11 17 % $ 2.61 $ 2.19 19 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. (2) For a full reconciliation of our adjusted financial results, see tables in Adjusted financial results below. Highlights for the first half of fiscal 2019 . Our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending. Our business performance during the six months ended March 31, 2019 reflects continued global consumer spending growth amidst uneven global economic conditions. We recorded net revenues of $5.5 billion and $11.0 billion for the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 , respectively, an increase of 8% and 11% , respectively, over the prior-year comparable periods, reflecting continued growth in nominal payments volume and processed transactions. The effect of exchange rate movements in the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 , as partially mitigated by our hedging program, resulted in approximately negative one-and-a-half percentage point and negative one percentage point impact to our net revenues growth, respectively. Total operating expenses were $1.9 billion and $3.6 billion for the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 , respectively, an increase of 7% and 11% over the prior-year comparable period. The increase in the period was primarily due to higher personnel, marketing and general and administrative expenses, as we continue to invest to support our business growth. Adjusted financial results. Our financial results for the six months ended March 31, 2018 reflected the impact of certain significant items that we believe were not indicative of our ongoing operating performance in these or future periods, as they were either non-recurring or had no cash impact. As such, we believe the presentation of adjusted financial results excluding the following items provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the periods presented. There were no comparable adjustments recorded for the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 and the three months ended March 31, 2018 . • Remeasurement of deferred tax balances. During the six months ended March 31, 2018 , in connection with the Tax Act’s reduction of the corporate income tax rate, we remeasured our net deferred tax liabilities as of the enactment date, resulting in the recognition of a non-recurring, non-cash income tax benefit of $1.1 billion . See Note 12—Income Taxes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. • Transition tax on foreign earnings. During the six months ended March 31, 2018 , in connection with the Tax Act’s requirement that we include certain untaxed foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries in our fiscal 2018 taxable income, we recorded a one-time transition tax estimated to be approximately $1.1 billion . See Note 12—Income Taxes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. 30 Table of Contents Adjusted financial results are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be relied upon as substitutes for measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following table reconciles our as-reported financial measures, calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to our respective non-GAAP adjusted financial measures for the six months ended March 31, 2018 . There were no comparable adjustments recorded for the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 and the three months ended March 31, 2018 .

Diluted earnings per share and its respective total are calculated based on unrounded numbers. Common stock repurchases. During the three months ended March 31, 2019 , we repurchased 14 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market using $1.9 billion of cash on hand. In January 2019, our board of directors authorized an additional $8.5 billion share repurchase program. As of March 31, 2019 , we had remaining authorized funds of $8.4 billion for share repurchase. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Payments volume and transaction counts. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues. During the three months ended December 31, 2018, we updated our definition of payments volume to now include all disbursement volume related to Visa Direct, in addition to the funding volume previously included. All prior periods presented have been adjusted accordingly. Please refer to the Operational Performance Data section of Exhibit 99.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on January 30, 2019 for more details on the impact from this update in payments volume definition. Nominal payments volume in the United States posted low double-digit growth for the three and six months ended December 31, 2018 (1) , driven mainly by consumer debit and commercial. Nominal international payments volume growth was negatively impacted by movements in the U.S. dollar exchange rates. On a constant-dollar basis, which excludes the impact of exchange rate movements, our international payments volume growth rate for the three and six months ended December 31, 2018 was 11% . Growth in processed transactions reflects the ongoing worldwide shift to electronic payments. 31 Table of Contents The following table (2) presents nominal payments and cash volume: United States International Visa Inc.

Therefore, service revenues reported for the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 were based on nominal payments volume reported by our financial institution clients for the three and six months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. (2) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes and totals are calculated based on unrounded numbers. (3) Includes consumer prepaid volume and Interlink volume. (4) Includes large, middle and small business credit and debit, as well as commercial prepaid volume. (5) Total nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume. Total nominal payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased on cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink and V PAY brands. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution clients, subject to review by Visa. On occasion, previously presented volume information may be updated. Prior-period updates, other than the change to the payments volume definition, are not material. (6) Growth on a constant-dollar basis excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar. 32 Table of Contents The following table (1) provides the number of transactions involving cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink, V PAY and PLUS cards processed on Visa’s networks during the periods presented: Three Months Ended March 31, Six Months Ended March 31, 2019 2018 % Change 2019 2018 % Change (in millions, except percentages) Visa processed transactions 32,544 29,321 11 % 66,476 59,829 11 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding.

Results of Operations Net Revenues The following table sets forth our net revenues earned in the U.S. and internationally: Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 vs. 2018 Six Months Ended March 31, 2019 vs. 2018 2019 2018 $ Change % Change (1) 2019 2018 $ Change % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) U.S. $ 2,479 $ 2,297 $ 182 8 % $ 4,987 $ 4,562 $ 425 9 % International 3,015 2,776 239 9 % 6,013 5,373 640 12 % Net revenues $ 5,494 $ 5,073 $ 421 8 % $ 11,000 $ 9,935 $ 1,065 11 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. The increase in net revenues reflects the continued growth in nominal payments volume and processed transactions. Our net revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. The effect of exchange rate movements in the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 , as partially mitigated by our hedging program, resulted in approximately negative one-and-a-half percentage point and negative one percentage point impact to our net revenues growth, respectively. The following table sets forth the components of our net revenues: Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 vs. 2018 Six Months Ended March 31, 2019 vs. 2018 2019 2018 $ Change % Change (1) 2019 2018 $ Change % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Service revenues $ 2,417 $ 2,253 $ 164 7 % $ 4,759 $ 4,399 $ 360 8 % Data processing revenues 2,432 2,127 305 14 % 4,902 4,274 628 15 % International transaction revenues 1,796 1,752 44 3 % 3,647 3,418 229 7 % Other revenues 327 230 97 42 % 626 459 167 36 % Client incentives (1,478 ) (1,289 ) (189 ) 15 % (2,934 ) (2,615 ) (319 ) 12 % Net revenues $ 5,494 $ 5,073 $ 421 8 % $ 11,000 $ 9,935 $ 1,065 11 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. • Service revenues increased primarily due to 7% and 8% growth in nominal payments volume during the three and six -month comparable periods, respectively. • Data processing revenues increased mainly due to overall growth in processed transactions of 11% during the three and six -month comparable periods as well as select pricing modifications effective after the second quarter of fiscal 2018. 33 Table of Contents • International transaction revenues increased during the three and six-month comparable periods primarily due to select pricing modifications effective after the second quarter of fiscal 2018 as well as changes in the mix of our international transaction revenues. International transaction revenues also reflected a 2% decline and 1% growth in nominal cross-border volumes during the three and six-month comparable periods, respectively. • Other revenues increased during the three and six -month comparable periods primarily due to changes in the classification and timing of recognition of revenue as a result of the adoption of the new revenue standard as well as an increase in revenues from license fees and optional services. • Client incentives increased during the three and six -month comparable periods mainly due to incentives recognized on long-term customer contracts that were initiated or renewed after the second quarter of fiscal 2018 and overall growth in global payments volume. Client incentives also increased due to changes in classification and timing of recognition as a result of the adoption of the new revenue standard. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or execution of new contracts. Operating Expenses The following table sets forth components of our total operating expenses: Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 vs. 2018 Six Months Ended March 31, 2019 vs. 2018 2019 2018 $ Change % Change (1) 2019 2018 $ Change % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Personnel $ 894 $ 824 $ 70 8 % $ 1,701 $ 1,503 $ 198 13 % Marketing 241 261 (20 ) (8 )% 517 484 33 7 % Network and processing 171 169 2 1 % 344 329 15 5 % Professional fees 101 108 (7 ) (7 )% 192 200 (8 ) (4 )% Depreciation and amortization 160 153 7 4 % 319 298 21 7 % General and administrative 264 222 42 19 % 540 458 82 18 % Litigation provision 22 — 22 NM 29 — 29 NM Total operating expenses $ 1,853 $ 1,737 $ 116 7 % $ 3,642 $ 3,272 $ 370 11 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. • Personnel expenses increased primarily due to an increase in headcount reflecting our strategy to invest for future growth. • Marketing expenses in 2018 included spend for the Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, which did not recur in 2019. This decrease in 2019 was partially offset in the three-month comparable period and was more than offset in the six-month comparable period by changes in the classification and timing of recognition of certain marketing expenses as a result of the adoption of the new revenue standard. • General and administrative expenses increased mainly due to higher product enhancement costs in support of our business growth, changes in the classification and timing of recognition of certain general and administrative expenses as a result of the adoption of the new revenue standard and higher indirect taxes. 34 Table of Contents Non-operating Income (Expense) The following table sets forth the components of our non-operating income (expense). Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 vs. 2018 Six Months Ended March 31, 2019 vs. 2018 2019 2018 $ Change % Change (1) 2019 2018 $ Change % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Interest expense, net $ (140 ) $ (153 ) $ 13 (9 )% $ (285 ) $ (307 ) $ 22 (7 )% Investment income and other 176 34 142 410 % 234 100 134 133 % Total non-operating income ( expense) $ 36 $ (119 ) $ 155 (130 )% $ (51 ) $ (207 ) $ 156 (75 )% (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. • Interest expense decreased in the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 primarily as a result of entering into derivative instruments in fiscal 2019 that lowered the cost of borrowing on a portion of our outstanding debt. • Investment income and other increased in the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 primarily due to gains on our equity investments as well as higher interest income on our cash and investments. Effective Income Tax Rate The effective income tax rate was 19% for the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 , and 19% and 21% for the three and six months ended March 31, 2018, respectively. The effective tax rate for the six months ended March 31, 2019 differs from the effective tax rate in the same prior-year period primarily due to the effects of the Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017, as discussed below: • The Tax Act reduced the statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. In fiscal 2018, our statutory federal corporate rate was a blended rate of 24.5%. Federal tax expense for the six months ended March 31, 2019 was determined at a 21% tax rate compared to the 24.5% tax rate in the prior-year period; • The Tax Act enacted a new deduction for foreign-derived intangible income (“FDII”) and a new tax on global intangible low-tax income (“GILTI”). Both FDII and GILTI became effective for us on October 1, 2018; and • The absence of the following items recorded during the six months ended March 31, 2018: ▪ an $80 million benefit due to a non-recurring audit settlement during the three months ended March 31, 2018; ▪ a $1.1 billion non-recurring, non-cash benefit from the remeasurement of deferred tax balances recorded in the three months ended December 31, 2017, in connection with the reduction in U.S. federal tax rate enacted by the Tax Act; and ▪ a $1.1 billion one-time transition tax expense on certain untaxed foreign earnings recorded in the three months ended December 31, 2017, in connection with the requirement enacted by the Tax Act . We previously recorded provisional amounts for the transition tax and the tax effects of various other tax provisions enacted by the Tax Act. As permitted by ASU 2018-05, we completed the determination of the accounting impacts of the transition tax and the tax effects of these various tax provisions in the three months ended December 31, 2018. The adjustments to the provisional amounts were not material. In addition, we adopted the accounting policy of accounting for taxes on GILTI in the period that it is subject to such tax. 35 Table of Contents Adjusted effective income tax rate. Our financial results for the six months ended March 31, 2018 reflect the impact of certain significant items that we believe were not indicative of our operating performance during the period, as they were either non-recurring or had no cash impact. As such, we have presented our adjusted effective income tax rate for the period in the table below, which we believe provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the reported period. There were no comparable adjustments recorded for the three and six months ended March 31, 2019 or the three months ended March 31, 2018. See Overview—Adjusted financial results within this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for descriptions of the adjustments in the tables below. Six Months Ended March 31, 2018 Income Before Income Taxes Income Tax Provision Effective Income Tax Rate (1) (in millions, except percentages) As reported $ 6,456 $ 1,329 20.6 % Remeasurement of deferred tax balances — 1,133 Transition tax on foreign earnings — (1,147 ) As adjusted $ 6,456 $ 1,315 20.4 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Effective income tax rate is calculated based on unrounded numbers. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Data The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the periods presented: Six Months Ended March 31, 2019 2018 (in millions) Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 5,358 $ 5,729 Investing activities (396 ) (1,137 ) Financing activities (5,486 ) (6,533 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (171 ) 206 Decrease in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents $ (695 ) $ (1,735 ) Operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities for the six months ended March 31, 2019 was lower than the prior-year comparable period primarily due to higher payments from the litigation escrow account in the current year and the first installment payment of the transition tax in connection with the Tax Act, partially offset by continued growth in our underlying business. Investing activities. Cash used in investing activities for the six months ended March 31, 2019 was lower than the prior-year comparable period as prior-year purchases of investment securities reflected additional investment of net proceeds received from fixed-rate senior notes issued in September 2017. Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities for the six months ended March 31, 2019 was lower than the prior-year comparable period primarily due to the repayment of the Senior Notes due 2017 in the prior year. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the repurchases of our class A common stock and higher dividends paid in the current year. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements . 36 Table of Contents Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings, and the returns that these holdings provide. Based on our current cash flow forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances. Credit Ratings During the six months ended March 31, 2019 , our credit ratings by Standard and Poor’s were upgraded to the following as compared to September 30, 2018 : Standard and Poor’s March 31, 2019 September 30, 2018 Debt type Rating Outlook Rating Outlook Short-term unsecured debt A-1+ Stable A-1 Positive Long-term unsecured debt AA- Stable A+ Positive Various factors affect our credit ratings, including changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the electronic payment industry, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a significant downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets. Uses of Liquidity There has been no significant change to our primary uses of liquidity since September 30, 2018 , except as discussed below. Common stock repurchases. During the six months ended March 31, 2019 , we repurchased 31 million shares of our class A common stock using $4.3 billion of cash on hand. In January 2019, our board of directors authorized an additional $8.5 billion share repurchase program. As of March 31, 2019 , we had remaining authorized funds of $8.4 billion for share repurchase. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to January 2019 have been completed. See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Dividends . During the six months ended March 31, 2019 , we declared and paid $1.1 billion in dividends to holders of our common and preferred stock. On April 16, 2019 , our board of directors declared a cash dividend in the amount of $0.25 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and UK&I and Europe preferred stock on an as-converted basis), which will be paid on June 4, 2019 , to all holders of record as of May 17, 2019 . See Note 9—Stockholders’ Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. All three series of preferred stock and class B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends. Deferred purchase consideration. On June 21, 2016, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe. In connection with the purchase, we will pay an additional €1.0 billion, plus 4% compound annual interest, on the third anniversary of the closing of Visa Europe acquisition. Derivative Financial Instruments In March 2019, we entered into interest rate and cross-currency swap agreements on a portion of our outstanding 3.15% Senior Notes due December 2025 that allows us to manage our interest rate exposure through a combination of fixed and floating rates and reduce our overall cost of borrowing on our debt. Together these swap agreements effectively convert a portion of our U.S. dollar denominated fixed-rate payments into euro denominated floating-rate payments. See Note 5—Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. 37 Table of Contents Fair Value Measurements—Financial Instruments As of March 31, 2019 , our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included $13.8 billion of assets and $44 million of liabilities. See Note 5—Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk There has been no significant change to our market risks since September 30, 2018 , except as discussed below. In March 2019, we entered into interest rate and cross-currency swap agreements on a portion of our outstanding senior notes that allows us to manage our interest rate exposure through a combination of fixed and floating rates and reduce our overall cost of borrowing. Together these swap agreements effectively convert a portion of our U.S. dollar denominated fixed-rate payments into euro denominated floating-rate payments. By entering into interest rate swaps, we have assumed risks associated with market interest rate fluctuations. See Note 5—Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) of Visa Inc. at the end of the period covered by this report and, based on such evaluation, have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures of Visa Inc. were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of such date. Changes in internal control over financial reporting. During the six months ended March 31, 2019 , the Company implemented a new client incentives accounting system along with enhancements and modifications to existing internal controls and procedures to comply with the new revenue standard . There have been no other changes in the internal control over financial reporting of Visa Inc. that occurred during the fiscal period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 38 Table of Contents PART II.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2018 (UNAUDITED) Note 1—Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Organization. Visa Inc. (“Visa” or the “Company”) is a global payments technology company that enables fast, secure and reliable electronic payments across more than 200 countries and territories. Visa and its wholly-owned consolidated subsidiaries, including Visa U.S.A. Inc. (“Visa U.S.A.”), Visa International Service Association (“Visa International”), Visa Worldwide Pte. Limited, Visa Europe Limited (“Visa Europe”), Visa Canada Corporation (“Visa Canada”), Visa Technology & Operations LLC and CyberSource Corporation, operate one of the world’s largest retail electronic payments networks — VisaNet — which facilitates authorization, clearing and settlement of payment transactions and enables the Company to provide its financial institution and merchant clients a wide range of products, platforms and value-added services. VisaNet also offers fraud protection for account holders and assured payment for merchants. Visa is not a bank and does not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders on Visa products. In most cases, account holder and merchant relationships belong to, and are managed by, Visa’s financial institution clients. Consolidation and basis of presentation. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Visa and its consolidated entities and are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”). The Company consolidates its majority-owned and controlled entities, including variable interest entities (“VIEs”) for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The Company’s investments in VIEs have not been material to its consolidated financial statements as of and for the periods presented. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements are presented in accordance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requirements for Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and, consequently, do not include all of the annual disclosures required by U.S. GAAP. Reference should be made to the Visa Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2018 for additional disclosures, including a summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements include all normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the Company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods presented. Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements. In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, which requires an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of goods or services to customers. This new revenue standard replaces all existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP. Subsequently, the FASB also issued a series of amendments to the new revenue standard. The new revenue standard changes the classification and timing of recognition of certain client incentives and marketing-related funds paid to customers, as well as revenues and expenses for market development funds and services provided to customers as an incentive. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2018 using the modified retrospective transition method applied to the aggregate of all modifications for contracts not completed as of October 1, 2018. Results for reporting periods beginning after October 1, 2018 are presented under the new revenue standard. The comparative prior period amounts appearing on the financial statements have not been restated and continue to be reported under the prior revenue standard. See Note 2—Revenues for the impact of the new revenue standard on the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the three months ended December 31, 2018. 8 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) The following table summarizes the cumulative transition adjustments for the adoption of the new revenue standard recorded on the October 1, 2018 consolidated balance sheet to reflect the aggregate impact to all contracts not completed as of October 1, 2018: Fiscal Year 2018 Closing Balance Sheet Cumulative Transition Adjustment for New Revenue Standard Fiscal Year 2019 Opening Balance Sheet (in millions) Assets Current portion of client incentives $ 340 $ 199 $ 539 Client incentives 538 614 1,152 Liabilities Client incentives 2,834 241 3,075 Accrued liabilities 1,160 6 1,166 Deferred tax liabilities 4,618 108 4,726 Other liabilities 2,666 58 2,724 Equity Accumulated income 11,318 400 11,718 In January 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-01, which amends certain aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of financial instruments, including the requirement to measure certain equity investments at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2018, using the modified retrospective transition method for marketable equity securities and the prospective method for non-marketable equity securities. The Company has elected to use the measurement alternative for non-marketable equity securities, defined as cost adjusted for changes from observable transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer, less impairment. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, which requires the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities arising from operating leases on the balance sheet. Subsequently, the FASB also issued a series of amendments to this new lease standard that address the transition methods available and clarify the guidance for lessor costs. The Company will adopt the standard effective October 1, 2019 and expects to adopt using the modified retrospective transition method without restating comparative periods. The adoption is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, which requires that entities recognize the income tax consequences of an intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2018. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, which requires that a statement of cash flows includes the total of cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2018. The adoption impacted the presentation of transactions related to the U.S. litigation escrow account and customer collateral on the consolidated statements of cash flows. The prior period statement of cash flows have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the impact of this ASU, which had no impact on the Company’s balance sheets, statements of operations or statements of comprehensive income for any period. In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-07, which requires that the service cost component of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost be presented in the same line item as other employee compensation costs, while the other components be presented separately as non-operating income (expense). In addition, only the service cost component is eligible for capitalization, when applicable. Retrospective application is required for the change in income statement presentation while the change in capitalized benefit cost is required to be applied prospectively. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2018, which did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. The service cost component of net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost is presented in personnel expenses while the other components are presented in other non-operating expense on the Company’s 9 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) consolidated statement of operations. The Company did not apply the standard retrospectively for the change in income statement presentation as the impact would have been immaterial. In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-09, which amends the scope of modification accounting for share-based payment arrangements. Specifically, an entity would not apply modification accounting if the fair value, vesting conditions, and classification of the awards are the same immediately before and after the modification. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2018. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, which aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. The Company adopted the standard effective October 1, 2018. The adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. Note 2—Revenues Impact of the New Revenue Standard The following tables summarize the impact of the new revenue standard on the Company’s consolidated statement of operations for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2018: For the Three Months Ended December 31, 2018 As Reported Impact of the New Revenue Standard Results Under Prior Revenue Standard (in millions) Net revenues $ 5,506 $ (52 ) $ 5,454 Operating Expenses Marketing 276 (30 ) 246 Professional fees 91 (3 ) 88 General and administrative 276 (3 ) 273 Total operating expenses 1,789 (36 ) 1,753 Operating income 3,717 (16 ) 3,701 Income before income taxes 3,630 (16 ) 3,614 Income tax provision 653 (1 ) 652 Net income 2,977 (15 ) 2,962 December 31, 2018 As Reported Impact of the New Revenue Standard Results Under Prior Revenue Standard (in millions) Assets Current portion of client incentives $ 547 $ (198 ) $ 349 Client incentives 1,264 (661 ) 603 Liabilities Accounts payable 124 (23 ) 101 Client incentives 3,345 (260 ) 3,085 Accrued liabilities 1,487 (7 ) 1,480 Deferred tax liabilities 4,835 (109 ) 4,726 Other liabilities 2,703 (45 ) 2,658 Equity Accumulated income 11,908 (415 ) 11,493 10 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) Disaggregation of Revenues The nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of the Company’s revenues and cash flows and how they are affected by economic factors are most appropriately depicted through the Company’s revenue categories and geographical markets. The following tables disaggregate the Company’s net revenues by revenue category and by geography for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 : Three Months Ended December 31, 2018 2017 (in millions) Service revenues $ 2,342 $ 2,146 Data processing revenues 2,470 2,147 International transaction revenues 1,851 1,666 Other revenues 299 229 Client incentives (1,456 ) (1,326 ) Net revenues $ 5,506 $ 4,862 Three Months Ended December 31, 2018 2017 (in millions) U.S. $ 2,508 $ 2,265 International 2,998 2,597 Net revenues $ 5,506 $ 4,862 Revenue recognition. The Company's net revenues are comprised principally of the following categories: service revenues, data processing revenues, international transaction revenues, and other revenues, reduced by costs incurred under client incentives arrangements. As a payment network service provider, the Company’s obligation to the customer is to stand ready to provide continuous access to our payment network over the contractual term. Consideration is variable based primarily upon the amount and type of transactions and payments volume on Visa’s products. The Company recognizes revenues, net of sales and other similar taxes, as the payment network services are performed. Fixed fees for payment network services are generally recognized ratably over the related service period. The Company has elected the optional exemption to not disclose the remaining performance obligations related to payment network services. Service revenues consist of revenues earned for services provided in support of client usage of Visa products. Current quarter service revenues are primarily assessed using a calculation of current pricing applied to the prior quarter's payments volume. The Company also earns revenues from assessments designed to support ongoing acceptance and volume growth initiatives, which are recognized in the same period the related volume is transacted. Data processing revenues consist of revenues earned for authorization, clearing, settlement, network access and other maintenance and support services that facilitate transaction and information processing among the Company's clients globally. Data processing revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are performed. International transaction revenues are earned for cross-border transaction processing and currency conversion activities. Cross-border transactions arise when the country of origin of the issuer is different from that of the merchant. International transaction revenues are primarily generated by cross-border payments and cash volume. Other revenues consist mainly of license fees for use of the Visa brand, fees for account holder services, licensing and certification and other activities related to the Company's acquired entities. Other revenues also include optional services or product enhancements, such as extended account holder protection and concierge services. Other revenues are recognized in the same period the related transactions occur or services are performed. 11 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) Client incentives. The Company enters into long-term contracts with financial institution clients, merchants and strategic partners for various programs designed to increase revenues recognized by growing payments volume, increasing Visa product acceptance, winning merchant routing transactions over to Visa's network and driving innovation. These incentives are primarily accounted for as reductions to revenues or as operating expenses if the payment is in exchange for a distinct good or service provided by the customer. The Company generally capitalizes upfront and fixed incentive payments under these agreements and amortizes the amounts as a reduction to revenues ratably over the contractual term. Incentives that are earned by the customer based on performance targets are recorded as reductions to revenues based on management's estimate of each client's future performance. These accruals are regularly reviewed and estimates of performance are adjusted, as appropriate, based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or the execution of new contracts. Note 3—Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash and Restricted Cash Equivalents The Company’s cash and cash equivalents include cash and certain highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less from the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are primarily recorded at cost, which approximates fair value due to their generally short maturities. The Company defines restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents as cash and cash equivalents that cannot be withdrawn or used for general operating activities. The Company reconciles cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents reported in the consolidated balance sheets that aggregate to the beginning and ending balances shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows as follows: December 31, September 30, 2018 2017 2018 2017 (in millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 8,289 $ 8,138 $ 8,162 $ 9,874 Restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents: U.S. litigation escrow 1,496 883 1,491 1,031 Customer collateral 1,330 1,155 1,324 1,106 Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents $ 11,115 $ 10,176 $ 10,977 $ 12,011 Note 4—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans U.S. Retrospective Responsibility Plan Under the terms of the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Company maintains an escrow account from which settlements of, or judgments in, certain litigation referred to as the “U.S. covered litigation” are paid. The escrow funds are held in money market investments along with interest income earned, less applicable taxes and are classified as restricted cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets. The balance of the escrow account was $1.5 billion at December 31, 2018 and September 30, 2018 . See Note 13—Legal Matters . The accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the litigation escrow account balance. The Company did not record an additional accrual for the U.S. covered litigation during the three months ended December 31, 2018 . See Note 13—Legal Matters . 12 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plan Visa Inc., Visa International and Visa Europe are parties to certain existing and potential litigation relating to the setting of multilateral interchange fee rates in the Visa Europe territory (the “VE territory covered litigation”). Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover certain losses resulting from VE territory covered litigation (the “VE territory covered losses”) through a periodic adjustment to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the UK&I and Europe preferred stock. VE territory covered losses are recorded in “right to recover for covered losses” within equity before the corresponding adjustment to the applicable conversion rate is effected. Adjustments to the conversion rate may be executed once in any six-month period unless a single, individual loss greater than € 20 million is incurred, in which case, the six-month limitation does not apply. When the adjustment to the conversion rate is made, the amount previously recorded in “right to recover for covered losses” as contra-equity is then recorded against the book value of the preferred stock within stockholders’ equity. During the three months ended December 31, 2018 , the Company recovered $6 million of VE territory covered losses through adjustments to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the UK&I and Europe preferred stock. The conversion rates applicable to the UK&I and Europe preferred stock were reduced from 12.955 and 13.888 , respectively, as of September 30, 2018 to 12.939 and 13.886 , respectively, as of December 31, 2018 . The following table sets forth the activities related to VE territory covered losses in preferred stock and “right to recover for covered losses” within equity during the three months ended December 31, 2018 . VE territory covered losses incurred reflect settlements with merchants and additional legal costs. See Note 13—Legal Matters .

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) Note 5—Fair Value Measurements and Investments Assets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis Fair Value Measurements Using Inputs Considered as Level 1 Level 2 December 31, 2018 September 30, 2018 December 31, 2018 September 30, 2018 (in millions) Assets Cash equivalents and restricted cash: Money market funds $ 7,063 $ 6,252 U.S. government-sponsored debt securities $ 98 $ 1,048 Investment securities: Marketable equity securities 123 113 U.S. government-sponsored debt securities 5,234 5,008 U.S. Treasury securities 2,236 2,508 Other current and non-current assets: Foreign exchange derivative instruments 113 78 Total $ 9,422 $ 8,873 $ 5,445 $ 6,134 Liabilities Accrued liabilities: Foreign exchange derivative instruments $ 28 $ 22 Total $ — $ — $ 28 $ 22 There were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 assets during the three months ended December 31, 2018 . Level 1 assets. Money market funds, publicly-traded equity securities and U.S. Treasury securities are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets. Level 2 assets and liabilities. The fair value of U.S. government-sponsored debt securities, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. The pricing data obtained from outside sources is reviewed internally for reasonableness, compared against benchmark quotes from independent pricing sources, then confirmed or revised accordingly. Foreign exchange derivative instruments are valued using inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data. There were no substantive changes to the valuation techniques and related inputs used to measure fair value during the three months ended December 31, 2018 . Marketable equity securities. Marketable equity securities are publicly traded and measured at fair value within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy, as fair value is based on quoted prices in active markets. On October 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2016-01 which changed the Company’s accounting for marketable equity securities. Beginning on October 1, 2018, unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair value of marketable equity securities are recognized in non-operating income (expense). U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and U.S. Treasury securities. The Company considers U.S. government-sponsored debt securities and U.S. Treasury securities to be available-for-sale and held $7.5 billion of these investment securities as of December 31, 2018 and September 30, 2018 . A majority of the Company’s long-term available-for-sale investment securities are due within one to five years. 14 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-recurring Basis Non-marketable equity securities. The Company’s non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable market values. These investments are classified as Level 3 due to the absence of quoted market prices, the inherent lack of liquidity and the fact that inputs used to measure fair value are unobservable and require management’s judgment. On October 1, 2018, the Company adopted ASU 2016-01 which changed the Company’s accounting for non-marketable equity securities. Beginning on October 1, 2018, the Company’s policy is to adjust the carrying value of its non-marketable equity securities to fair value when transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer are observable in the market. All gains and losses on non-marketable equity securities, realized and unrealized, are recognized in non-operating income (expense). Non-marketable equity securities totaled $159 million and $137 million at December 31, 2018 and September 30, 2018 , respectively, and are classified in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets. During the three months ended December 31, 2018 , there were no upward or downward adjustments made to the carrying value of non-marketable equity securities. During the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 , there were no significant impairments of non-marketable equity securities. Non-financial assets and liabilities. Long-lived assets such as goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, finite-lived intangible assets and property, equipment and technology are considered non-financial assets. The Company does not have any non-financial liabilities measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. Finite-lived intangible assets primarily consist of customer relationships, trade names and reseller relationships, all of which were obtained through acquisitions. If the Company were required to perform a quantitative assessment for impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, the fair values would generally be estimated using an income approach. As the assumptions employed to measure these assets on a non-recurring basis are based on management’s judgment using internal and external data, these fair value determinations are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy. The Company completed its annual impairment review of its indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill as of February 1, 2018, and concluded that there was no impairment. No recent events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment existed at December 31, 2018 . Gains and Losses on Marketable and Non-marketable Equity Securities The Company recognized a net unrealized loss of $20 million , and no net realized gains or losses on its marketable and non-marketable equity securities for the three months ended December 31, 2018 . Other Fair Value Disclosures Long-term debt. Debt instruments are measured at amortized cost on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The fair value of the debt instruments, as provided by third-party pricing vendors, is based on quoted prices in active markets for similar, not identical, assets. The pricing data obtained from outside sources is reviewed internally for reasonableness, compared against benchmark quotes from independent pricing sources, then confirmed or revised accordingly. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The carrying value and estimated fair value of long-term debt was $16.6 billion and $16.7 billion , respectively, as of December 31, 2018. The carrying value and estimated fair value of long-term debt were both $16.6 billion as of September 30, 2018. Other financial instruments not measured at fair value. The following financial instruments are not measured at fair value on the Company’s unaudited consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2018 , but disclosure of their fair values is required: time deposits recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets, settlement receivable and payable and customer collateral. The estimated fair value of such instruments at December 31, 2018 approximates their carrying value due to their generally short maturities. If measured at fair value in the financial statements, these financial instruments would be classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. 15 Table of Contents VISA INC.

Note 7—Settlement Guarantee Management The Company indemnifies its clients for settlement losses suffered due to failure of any other client to fund its settlement obligations in accordance with the Visa operating rules. This indemnification creates settlement risk for the Company due to the difference in timing between the date of a payment transaction and the date of subsequent settlement. Historically, the Company has experienced minimal losses as a result of its settlement risk guarantee. However, the Company’s future obligations, which could be material under its guarantees, are not determinable as they are dependent upon future events. The Company’s settlement exposure is limited to the amount of unsettled Visa payment transactions at any point in time, which vary significantly day to day. The Company’s maximum settlement exposure was $88.2 billion and the average daily settlement exposure was $56.1 billion during the three months ended December 31, 2018 . The Company maintains and regularly reviews global settlement risk policies and procedures to manage settlement exposure, which may require clients to post collateral if certain credit standards are not met. At December 31, 2018 and September 30, 2018 , the Company held collateral as follows: December 31, 2018 September 30, 2018 (in millions) Cash equivalents $ 1,720 $ 1,708 Pledged securities at market value 307 192 Letters of credit 1,346 1,382 Guarantees 952 860 Total $ 4,325 $ 4,142 Cash equivalent collateral reflected in customer collateral on the consolidated balance sheets is held by a custodian in an account under the Company’s name and ownership. At December 31, 2018 and September 30, 2018, $390 million and $384 million , respectively, of cash equivalent collateral is excluded from the consolidated balance sheets as clients retain beneficial ownership of it and it is only accessible to the Company in the event of default by the client on its settlement obligations. All other collateral is excluded from the consolidated balance sheets. 16 Table of Contents VISA INC.

(3) The reduction in equivalent number of shares of class A common stock was less than one million shares during the three months ended December 31, 2018 . (4) Class A common stock shares outstanding reflect repurchases settled on or before December 31, 2018 and September 30, 2018 . (5) The class B to class A common stock conversion rate is presented on a rounded basis. Conversion calculations for dividend payments are based on a conversion rate rounded to the tenth decimal. Reduction in as-converted shares. Under the terms of the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, the Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through periodic adjustments to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the UK&I and Europe preferred stock. The recovery has the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Company’s class A common stock, because it reduces the UK&I and Europe preferred stock conversion rates and consequently, reduces the as-converted class A common stock share count. 17 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) The following table presents effective price per share and recovery of VE territory covered losses through conversion rate adjustments: Three Months Ended December 31, 2018 Twelve Months Ended September 30, 2018 Preferred Stock UK&I Europe UK&I Europe (in millions, except per share data) Effective price per share (1) $ 137.19 $ 137.19 $ 113.05 $ 112.92 Recovery through conversion rate adjustment $ 5 $ 1 $ 35 $ 21 (1) Effective price per share for the quarter is calculated using the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s class A common stock over a pricing period in accordance with the Company’s current certificates of designations for its series B and C convertible participating preferred stock. Effective price per share for the fiscal year is calculated using the weighted-average effective prices of the respective adjustments made during the year. Common stock repurchases. The following table (1) presents share repurchases in the open market for the following periods: Three Months Ended December 31, 2018 2017 (in millions, except per share data) Shares repurchased in the open market (2) 17 16 Average repurchase price per share (3) $ 138.11 $ 110.24 Total cost $ 2,393 $ 1,778 (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Shares repurchased in the open market reflect repurchases settled during the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 . These amounts include repurchases traded but not yet settled on or before September 30, 2018 and 2017 , respectively, and exclude repurchases traded but not yet settled on or before December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. (2) All shares repurchased in the open market have been retired and constitute authorized but unissued shares. (3) Average repurchase price per share is calculated based on unrounded numbers. As of December 31, 2018 , the Company’s January 2018 share repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $1.8 billion for share repurchase. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to January 2018 have been completed. In January 2019 , the Company’s board of directors authorized an additional $8.5 billion share repurchase program. Dividends. O n January 29, 2019 , the Company’s board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.25 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and UK&I and Europe preferred stock on an as-converted basis). The cash dividend will be paid on March 5, 2019 , to all holders of record as of February 15, 2019 . The Company declared and paid $572 million in dividends to holders of the Company’s common stock during the three months ended December 31, 2018 . Note 10—Earnings Per Share Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to each class of shares by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding and participating securities during the period. Net income is allocated to each class of common stock and participating securities based on its proportional ownership on an as-converted basis. The weighted-average number of shares outstanding of each class of common stock reflects changes in ownership over the periods presented. See Note 9—Stockholders' Equity . Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding, participating securities and, if dilutive, potential class A common stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Dilutive class A common stock equivalents may consist of: (1) shares of class A common stock issuable upon the conversion of UK&I and Europe preferred stock and class B and C common stock based on the conversion rates in effect through the period, and (2) incremental shares of class A common stock calculated by applying the treasury stock method to the assumed exercise of employee stock options, the assumed purchase of stock under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the assumed vesting of unearned performance shares. 18 Table of Contents VISA INC.

Earnings per share is calculated based on unrounded numbers. (2) Net income is allocated based on proportional ownership on an as-converted basis. The weighted-average number of shares of as-converted class B common stock used in the income allocation was 400 million and 405 million for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The weighted-average number of shares of as-converted class C common stock used in the income allocation was 47 million and 51 million for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The weighted-average number of shares of preferred stock included within participating securities was 32 million of as-converted UK&I preferred stock for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 , and 44 million of as-converted Europe preferred stock for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017. (3) Weighted-average diluted shares outstanding are calculated on an as-converted basis and include incremental common stock equivalents, as calculated under the treasury stock method. The computation includes approximately 3 million and 5 million common stock equivalents for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively, because their effect would be dilutive. The computation excludes 1 million and 2 million of common stock equivalents for the three months ended December 31, 2018 , and 2017 respectively, because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. (4) Participating securities include preferred stock outstanding and unvested share-based payment awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents, such as the Company’s UK&I and Europe preferred stock, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and earned performance-based shares. Participating securities’ income is allocated based on the weighted-average number of shares of as-converted stock. Note 11—Share-based Compensation The Company granted the following equity awards to employees and non-employee directors under the 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan, or the EIP, during the three months ended December 31, 2018 : Granted Weighted-Average Grant Date Fair Value Weighted-Average Exercise Price Non-qualified stock options 1,109,645 $ 25.89 $ 134.76 Restricted stock units (“RSUs”) 2,503,888 $ 134.76 Performance-based shares (1) 540,538 $ 153.42 (1) Represents the maximum number of performance-based shares which could be earned. 19 Table of Contents VISA INC. NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS—(Continued) The Company’s non-qualified stock options and RSUs are equity awards with service-only conditions and are accordingly expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The Company’s performance-based shares are equity awards with service, market and performance conditions that are accounted for using the graded-vesting method. The Company recorded share-based compensation cost related to the EIP of $95 million and $64 million for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively, net of estimated forfeitures, which are adjusted as appropriate. Note 12—Income Taxes The effective income tax rates were 18% and 22% for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2018 differs from the effective tax rate in the same prior-year period primarily due to the effects of U.S. tax reform legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”), enacted on December 22, 2017, as discussed below: • The Tax Act reduced the statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. In fiscal 2018, the Company’s statutory federal corporate rate was a blended rate of 24.5% . Federal tax expense for the three months ended December 31, 2018 was determined at a 21% tax rate compared to the 24.5% tax rate in the prior-year period; • The Tax Act enacted a new deduction for foreign-derived intangible income (“FDII”) and a new tax on global intangible low-tax income (“GILTI”). Both FDII and GILTI became effective for the Company on October 1, 2018; and • The absence of: ▪ a $1.1 billion non-recurring, non-cash benefit from the remeasurement of deferred tax balances recorded in the three months ended December 31, 2017 , in connection with the reduction in U.S. federal tax rate enacted by the Tax Act; and ▪ a $1.1 billion one-time transition tax expense on certain untaxed foreign earnings recorded in the three months ended December 31, 2017 , in connection with the requirement enacted by the Tax Act . The Company previously recorded provisional amounts for the transition tax and the tax effects of various other tax provisions enacted by the Tax Act. As permitted by ASU 2018-05, the Company completed the determination of the accounting impacts of the transition tax and the tax effects of these various tax provisions in the three months ended December 31, 2018 . The adjustments to the provisional amounts were not material. In addition, the Company has adopted the accounting policy of accounting for taxes on GILTI in the period that it is subject to such tax. During the three months ended December 31, 2018 , the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits increased by $38 million , all of which would favorably impact the effective tax rate if recognized. The change in unrecognized tax benefits is primarily related to various tax positions across several jurisdictions. During the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 , there were no significant changes in interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. The Company’s tax filings are subject to examination by the U.S. federal, state and foreign taxing authorities. The timing and outcome of the final resolutions of the various ongoing income tax examinations are highly uncertain. It is not reasonably possible to estimate the increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. Note 13—Legal Matters The Company is party to various legal and regulatory proceedings. Some of these proceedings involve complex claims that are subject to substantial uncertainties and unascertainable damages. Accordingly, except as disclosed, the Company has not established reserves or ranges of possible loss related to these proceedings, as at this time in the proceedings, the matters do not relate to a probable loss and/or the amount or range of losses are not reasonably estimable. Although the Company believes that it has strong defenses for the litigation and regulatory proceedings described below, it could, in the future, incur judgments or fines or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows. From time to time, the Company may engage in settlement discussions or mediations with respect to one or more of its outstanding litigation matters, either on its own behalf or collectively with other parties. 20 Table of Contents VISA INC.

An accrual for the U.S. covered litigation and a charge to the litigation provision are recorded when a loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. In making this determination, the Company evaluates available information, including but not limited to actions taken by the litigation committee. The total accrual related to the U.S. covered litigation could be either higher or lower than the escrow account balance.

Unlike the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, the Europe retrospective responsibility plan does not have an escrow account that is used to fund settlements or judgments. The Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through periodic adjustments to the conversion rates applicable to the UK&I preferred stock and Europe preferred stock. An accrual for the VE territory covered losses and a reduction to stockholders’ equity will be recorded when the loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable. See further discussion below under VE Territory Covered Litigation and Note 4—U.S. and Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans . 21 Table of Contents VISA INC.

Settlement discussions with plaintiffs purporting to act on behalf of the putative Injunctive Relief Class are ongoing. On January 16, 2019, the bank defendants moved to dismiss the claims brought against them by the Injunctive Relief Class, on the grounds that plaintiffs lack standing and fail to state a claim against the bank defendants. VE Territory Covered Litigation UK Merchant Litigation Since July 2013, in excess of 450 Merchants (the capitalized term “Merchant,” when used in this section, means a merchant together with subsidiary/affiliate companies that are party to the same claim) have commenced proceedings against Visa Europe, Visa Inc. and Visa International relating to interchange rates in Europe, and in some cases relating to fees charged by Visa and certain Visa rules. As of the filing date, Visa Europe, Visa Inc. and Visa International have settled the claims asserted by over 75 Merchants, leaving more than 350 Merchants with outstanding claims. In addition, over 30 additional Merchants have threatened to commence similar proceedings. On November 29, 2018, Visa was granted permission to appeal aspects of the Court of Appeal’s judgment to the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, including the question of whether Visa’s UK interchange restricted competition . Other Litigation European Commission Proceedings Inter-regional Interchange Investigation. On December 4, 2018, the European Commission (EC) announced formal public consultation (known as “market testing”) of commitments proposed by Visa pursuant to Article 9 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 in order for the EC to conclude its investigation. Subject to market testing, the EC intends to adopt a decision declaring the commitments to be binding on Visa and concluding that there are no longer grounds for action by the EC and without any finding of infringement of the law by Visa. If accepted by the EC, the proposed commitments require Visa to cap its inter-regional multilateral interchange rates at 1.50% credit and 1.15% debit for “Card-Not-Present” transactions and 0.30% credit and 0.20% debit for “Card Present” transactions on consumer debit and credit cards issued outside of the European Economic Area when used at merchants located inside of the European Economic Area. The commitments would last for a period of five years following implementation. No fine will be imposed against Visa, and the commitments are proposed without prejudice to Visa’s position that its conduct did not infringe any law. The EC’s market testing was completed in January 2019, and the EC is expected to decide whether to formally adopt the proposed commitments in the first half of 2019. EMV Chip Liability Shift Plaintiffs filed a renewed motion for class certification on July 16, 2018, following an earlier denial of the motion without prejudice. Plaintiffs’ renewed motion was terminated without prejudice to reinstatement on October 17, 2018. 22 Table of Contents VISA INC.

Financial overview. Our financial results for the three months ended December 31, 2017 reflected the impact of certain significant items that we believe were not indicative of our operating performance in these or future periods, as they were either non-recurring or had no cash impact. There were no comparable adjustments recorded for the three months ended December 31, 2018 . Our as-reported U.S. GAAP and adjusted non-GAAP net income and diluted earnings per share for these periods were as follows: Three Months Ended December 31, (in millions, except percentages and per share data) 2018 2017 % Change (1) Net income, as reported $ 2,977 $ 2,522 18 % Diluted earnings per share, as reported $ 1.30 $ 1.07 21 % Net income, as adjusted (2) $ 2,977 $ 2,536 17 % Diluted earnings per share, as adjusted (2) $ 1.30 $ 1.08 21 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. (2) For a full reconciliation of our adjusted financial results, see tables in Adjusted financial results below. Highlights for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 . Our business is affected by overall economic conditions and consumer spending. Our business performance during the three months ended December 31, 2018 reflects continued, strong global consumer spending growth amidst uneven global economic conditions. We recorded net revenues of $5.5 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2018 , an increase of 13% over the prior-year comparable period, reflecting continued growth in nominal payments volume, nominal cross-border volume and processed transactions. The effect of exchange rate movements in the three months ended December 31, 2018 , as partially mitigated by our hedging program, resulted in approximately half a percentage point negative impact to our net revenues growth. Total operating expenses were $1.8 billion for the three months ended December 31, 2018 , an increase of 17% over the prior-year comparable period. The increase in the period was primarily due to higher personnel, marketing and general and administrative expenses, as we continue to invest to support our business growth. Adjusted financial results. Our financial results for the three months ended December 31, 2017 reflected the impact of certain significant items that we believe were not indicative of our ongoing operating performance in these or future periods, as they were either non-recurring or had no cash impact. As such, we believe the presentation of adjusted financial results excluding the following items provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the periods presented. There were no comparable adjustments recorded for the three months ended December 31, 2018 . • Remeasurement of deferred tax balances. During the three months ended December 31, 2017 , in connection with the Tax Act’s reduction of the corporate income tax rate, we remeasured our net deferred tax liabilities as of the enactment date, resulting in the recognition of a non-recurring, non-cash income tax benefit of $1.1 billion . See Note 12—Income Taxes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. • Transition tax on foreign earnings. During the three months ended December 31, 2017 , in connection with the Tax Act’s requirement that we include certain untaxed foreign earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries in our fiscal 2018 taxable income, we recorded a one-time transition tax estimated to be approximately $1.1 billion . See Note 12—Income Taxes to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. 25 Table of Contents Adjusted financial results are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be relied upon as substitutes for measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The following table reconciles our as-reported financial measures, calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, to our respective non-GAAP adjusted financial measures for the three months ended December 31, 2017 .

Diluted earnings per share and its respective total are calculated based on unrounded numbers. Common stock repurchases. During the three months ended December 31, 2018 , we repurchased 17 million shares of our class A common stock in the open market using $2.4 billion of cash on hand. As of December 31, 2018 , our January 2018 share repurchase program had remaining authorized funds of $1.8 billion for share repurchase. In January 2019, our board of directors authorized an additional $8.5 billion share repurchase program. See Note 9—Stockholders' Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. 26 Table of Contents Payments volume and transaction counts. Payments volume is the primary driver for our service revenues, and the number of processed transactions is the primary driver for our data processing revenues. During the three months ended December 31, 2018, we updated our definition of payments volume to now include all disbursement volume related to Visa Direct, in addition to the funding volume previously included. All prior periods presented have been adjusted accordingly. This change resulted in an increase of 0.5% in Visa Inc. total nominal payments volume growth for the three months ended September 30, 2018. Please refer to the Operational Performance Data section of Exhibit 99.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on January 30, 2019 for more details on the impact from this update in payments volume definition. Nominal payments volume in the United States posted low double-digit growth for the three months ended September 30, 2018 (1) , driven mainly by consumer credit and debit. Nominal international payments volume growth was negatively impacted by movements in the U.S. dollar exchange rates. On a constant-dollar basis, which excludes the impact of exchange rate movements, our international payments volume growth rate for the three months ended September 30, 2018 was 11% . Growth in processed transactions reflects the ongoing worldwide shift to electronic payments. The following table (2) presents nominal payments and cash volume: United States International Visa Inc. Three Months Ended September 30, (1) Three Months Ended September 30, (1) Three Months Ended September 30, (1) 2018 2017 % Change 2018 2017 % Change 2018 2017 % Change (in billions, except percentages) Nominal payments volume Consumer credit $ 382 $ 348 10 % $ 615 $ 592 4 % $ 997 $ 939 6 % Consumer debit (3) 408 358 14 % 459 428 7 % 868 785 11 % Commercial (4) 155 135 15 % 93 86 8 % 247 221 12 % Total nominal payments volume $ 945 $ 840 12 % $ 1,167 $ 1,106 6 % $ 2,112 $ 1,946 9 % Cash volume 145 142 2 % 578 615 (6 )% 723 756 (4 )% Total nominal volume (5) $ 1,089 $ 982 11 % $ 1,745 $ 1,720 1 % $ 2,835 $ 2,702 5 % The following table (2) presents nominal and constant payments and cash volume growth: International Visa Inc.

Therefore, service revenues reported for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 were based on nominal payments volume reported by our financial institution clients for the three months ended September 30, 2018 and 2017 , respectively. (2) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes and totals are calculated based on unrounded numbers. (3) Includes consumer prepaid volume and Interlink volume. (4) Includes large, middle and small business credit and debit, as well as commercial prepaid volume. (5) Total nominal volume is the sum of total nominal payments volume and cash volume. Total nominal payments volume is the total monetary value of transactions for goods and services that are purchased on cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink and V PAY brands. Cash volume generally consists of cash access transactions, balance access transactions, balance transfers and convenience checks. Total nominal volume is provided by our financial institution clients, subject to review by Visa. On occasion, previously presented volume information may be updated. Prior-period updates, other than the change to the payments volume definition, are not material. (6) Growth on a constant-dollar basis excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar. 27 Table of Contents The following table (1) provides the number of transactions involving cards and other form factors carrying the Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink, V PAY and PLUS cards processed on Visa’s networks during the periods presented: Three Months Ended December 31, 2018 2017 % Change (in millions, except percentages) Visa processed transactions 33,931 30,508 11 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage change is calculated based on unrounded numbers. Results of Operations Net Revenues The following table sets forth our net revenues earned in the U.S. and internationally: Three Months Ended December 31, 2018 vs. 2017 2018 2017 $ Change % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) U.S. $ 2,508 $ 2,265 $ 243 11 % International 2,998 2,597 401 15 % Net revenues $ 5,506 $ 4,862 $ 644 13 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. The increase in net revenues reflects the continued growth in nominal payments volume, nominal cross-border volume and processed transactions. Our net revenues are impacted by the overall strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar as payments volume and related revenues denominated in local currencies are converted to U.S. dollars. The effect of exchange rate movements in the three months ended December 31, 2018 , as partially mitigated by our hedging program, resulted in approximately half a percentage point negative impact to our net revenues growth. The following table sets forth the components of our net revenues: Three Months Ended December 31, 2018 vs. 2017 2018 2017 $ Change % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Service revenues $ 2,342 $ 2,146 $ 196 9 % Data processing revenues 2,470 2,147 323 15 % International transaction revenues 1,851 1,666 185 11 % Other revenues 299 229 70 30 % Client incentives (1,456 ) (1,326 ) (130 ) 10 % Net revenues $ 5,506 $ 4,862 $ 644 13 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. • Service revenues increased primarily due to 9% growth in nominal payments volume during the three -month comparable period. • Data processing revenues increased mainly due to overall growth in processed transactions of 11% during the three -month comparable period as well as select pricing modifications effective after the first quarter of fiscal 2018. 28 Table of Contents • International transaction revenues increased due to higher volatility in a broad range of currencies and 3% growth in nominal cross-border volume during the three -month comparable period. Growth in international transaction revenues also reflected select pricing modifications effective after the first quarter of fiscal 2018. • Other revenues increased primarily due to changes in the classification and timing of recognition of revenue as a result of the adoption of the new revenue standard. • Client incentives increased mainly due to incentives recognized on long-term customer contracts that were initiated or renewed after the first quarter of fiscal 2018 and overall growth in global payments volume. Client incentives also increased due to changes in classification and timing of recognition as a result of the adoption of the new revenue standard. The amount of client incentives we record in future periods will vary based on changes in performance expectations, actual client performance, amendments to existing contracts or execution of new contracts. Operating Expenses The following table sets forth components of our total operating expenses: Three Months Ended December 31, 2018 vs. 2017 2018 2017 $ Change % Change (1) (in millions, except percentages) Personnel $ 807 $ 679 $ 128 19 % Marketing 276 223 53 24 % Network and processing 173 160 13 8 % Professional fees 91 92 (1 ) (1 )% Depreciation and amortization 159 145 14 9 % General and administrative 276 236 40 17 % Litigation provision 7 — 7 NM Total operating expenses $ 1,789 $ 1,535 $ 254 17 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Percentage changes are calculated based on unrounded numbers. • Personnel expenses increased primarily due to an increase in headcount and higher incentive compensation, reflecting our strategy to invest for future growth. • Marketing expenses increased primarily due to changes in the classification and timing of recognition of certain marketing expenses as a result of the adoption of the new revenue standard as well as higher spending to support a number of campaigns. • General and administrative expenses increased mainly due to higher product enhancement costs in support of our business growth. Effective Income Tax Rate The effective income tax rates were 18% and 22% for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The effective tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2018 differs from the effective tax rate in the same prior-year period primarily due to the effects of the Tax Act enacted on December 22, 2017, as discussed below: • The Tax Act reduced the statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. In fiscal 2018, our statutory federal corporate rate was a blended rate of 24.5%. Federal tax expense for the three months ended December 31, 2018 was determined at a 21% tax rate compared to the 24.5% tax rate in the prior-year period; • The Tax Act enacted a new deduction for foreign-derived intangible income (“FDII”) and a new tax on global intangible low-tax income (“GILTI”). Both FDII and GILTI became effective for us on October 1, 2018; and 29 Table of Contents • The absence of: ▪ a $1.1 billion non-recurring, non-cash benefit from the remeasurement of deferred tax balances recorded in the three months ended December 31, 2017, in connection with the reduction in U.S. federal tax rate enacted by the Tax Act; and ▪ a $1.1 billion one-time transition tax expense on certain untaxed foreign earnings recorded in the three months ended December 31, 2017, in connection with the requirement enacted by the Tax Act . We previously recorded provisional amounts for the transition tax and the tax effects of various other tax provisions enacted by the Tax Act. As permitted by ASU 2018-05, we completed the determination of the accounting impacts of the transition tax and the tax effects of these various tax provisions in the three months ended December 31, 2018. The adjustments to the provisional amounts were not material. In addition, we have adopted the accounting policy of accounting for taxes on GILTI in the period that it is subject to such tax. Adjusted effective income tax rate. Our financial results for the three months ended December 31, 2017 reflect the impact of certain significant items that we believe were not indicative of our operating performance during the period, as they were either non-recurring or had no cash impact. As such, we have presented our adjusted effective income tax rate for the period in the table below, which we believe provides a clearer understanding of our operating performance for the reported period. There were no comparable adjustments recorded for the three months ended December 31, 2018. See Overview—Adjusted financial results within this Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for descriptions of the adjustments in the tables below. Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 Income Before Income Taxes Income Tax Provision Effective Income Tax Rate (1) (in millions, except percentages) As reported $ 3,239 $ 717 22.1 % Remeasurement of deferred tax balances — 1,133 Transition tax on foreign earnings — (1,147 ) As adjusted $ 3,239 $ 703 21.7 % (1) Figures in the table may not recalculate exactly due to rounding. Effective income tax rate is calculated based on unrounded numbers. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flow Data The following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the periods presented: Three Months Ended December 31, 2018 2017 (in millions) Total cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 3,294 $ 2,813 Investing activities (70 ) (707 ) Financing activities (3,018 ) (4,021 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (68 ) 80 Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents $ 138 $ (1,835 ) Operating activities. Cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended December 31, 2018 was higher than the prior-year comparable period, reflecting continued growth in our underlying business. Investing activities. Cash used in investing activities for the three months ended December 31, 2018 was lower than the prior-year comparable period as prior-year purchases of investment securities reflected additional investment of net proceeds received from fixed-rate senior notes issued in September 2017. 30 Table of Contents Financing activities. Cash used in financing activities for the three months ended December 31, 2018 was lower than the prior-year comparable period primarily due to the repayment of the Senior Notes due 2017 in the prior year. This decrease was partially offset by an increase in the repurchases of our class A common stock and higher dividends paid in the current year. See Note 9—Stockholders' Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements . Sources of Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are cash on hand, cash flow from operations, our investment portfolio and access to various equity and borrowing arrangements. Funds from operations are maintained in cash and cash equivalents and short-term or long-term available-for-sale investment securities based upon our funding requirements, access to liquidity from these holdings, and the returns that these holdings provide. Based on our current cash flow forecasts of our short-term and long-term liquidity needs, we believe that our projected sources of liquidity will be sufficient to meet our projected liquidity needs for more than the next 12 months. We will continue to assess our liquidity position and potential sources of supplemental liquidity in view of our operating performance, current economic and capital market conditions and other relevant circumstances. Credit Ratings During the three months ended December 31, 2018 , our credit ratings by Standard and Poor’s were upgraded to the following as compared to September 30, 2018 : Standard and Poor’s December 31, 2018 September 30, 2018 Debt type Rating Outlook Rating Outlook Short-term unsecured debt A-1+ Stable A-1 Positive Long-term unsecured debt AA- Stable A+ Positive Various factors affect our credit ratings, including changes in our operating performance, the economic environment, conditions in the electronic payment industry, our financial position and changes in our business strategy. We do not currently foresee any reasonable circumstances under which our credit ratings would be significantly downgraded. If a significant downgrade were to occur, it could adversely impact, among other things, our future borrowing costs and access to capital markets. Uses of Liquidity There has been no significant change to our primary uses of liquidity since September 30, 2018 , except as discussed below. Common stock repurchases. During the three months ended December 31, 2018 , we repurchased 17 million shares of our class A common stock using $2.4 billion of cash on hand. As of December 31, 2018 , we had remaining authorized funds of $1.8 billion for share repurchase. All share repurchase programs authorized prior to January 2018 have been completed. In January 2019, our board of directors authorized an additional $8.5 billion share repurchase program. See Note 9—Stockholders' Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. Dividends . During the three months ended December 31, 2018 , we declared and paid $572 million in dividends to holders of our common stock. On January 29, 2019 , our board of directors declared a cash dividend in the amount of $0.25 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and UK&I and Europe preferred stock on an as-converted basis), which will be paid on March 5, 2019 , to all holders of record as of February 15, 2019 . See Note 9—Stockholders' Equity to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. We expect to continue paying quarterly dividends in cash, subject to approval by the board of directors. All three series of preferred stock and class B and C common stock will share ratably on an as-converted basis in such future dividends. Deferred purchase consideration. On June 21, 2016, we acquired 100% of the share capital of Visa Europe. In connection with the purchase, we will pay an additional €1.0 billion, plus 4% compound annual interest, on the third anniversary of the closing of Visa Europe acquisition. Fair Value Measurements—Financial Instruments As of December 31, 2018 , our financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis included $14.9 billion of assets and $28 million of liabilities. See Note 5—Fair Value Measurements and Investments to our unaudited consolidated financial statements. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 3. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk There have been no significant changes to our market risks during the three months ended December 31, 2018 , compared to September 30, 2018 . ITEM 4. Controls and Procedures Disclosure controls and procedures. Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) of Visa Inc. at the end of the period covered by this report and, based on such evaluation, have concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures of Visa Inc. were effective at the reasonable assurance level as of such date. Changes in internal control over financial reporting. During the three-months ended December 31, 2018, the Company implemented a new client incentives accounting system along with enhancements and modifications to existing internal controls and procedures to comply with the new revenue standard . There have been no other changes in the internal control over financial reporting of Visa Inc. that occurred during the fiscal period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. 32 Table of Contents PART II.

Basis of Presentation The accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of The Procter & Gamble Company and subsidiaries (""the Company,"" ""Procter & Gamble,"" ""P&G,"" ""we"" or ""our"") should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. We have prepared these statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for interim financial information. Note that certain columns and rows may not add due to rounding. In the opinion of management, the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods reported. However, the results of operations included in such financial statements may not necessarily be indicative of annual results. 2. New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2023-07, “Segment Reporting: Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures.” This guidance requires disclosure of incremental segment information on an annual and interim basis. This amendment is effective for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2025 and our interim periods within the fiscal year ending June 30, 2026. We are currently assessing the impact of this guidance on our disclosures. In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, “Income Taxes: Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures.” This guidance requires consistent categories and greater disaggregation of information in the rate reconciliation and disclosures of income taxes paid by jurisdiction. This amendment is effective for our fiscal year ending June 30, 2026. We are currently assessing the impact of this guidance on our disclosures. No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had, or is expected to have, a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 3. Segment Information Under U.S. GAAP, our operating segments are aggregated into five reportable segments: 1) Beauty, 2) Grooming, 3) Health Care, 4) Fabric & Home Care and 5) Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Our five reportable segments are comprised of: • Beauty : Hair Care (Conditioners, Shampoos, Styling Aids, Treatments); Skin and Personal Care (Antiperspirants and Deodorants, Personal Cleansing, Skin Care); • Grooming : Grooming (Appliances, Female Blades & Razors, Male Blades & Razors, Pre- and Post-Shave Products, Other Grooming); • Health Care : Oral Care (Toothbrushes, Toothpaste, Other Oral Care); Personal Health Care (Gastrointestinal, Pain Relief, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements, Other Personal Health Care); • Fabric & Home Care : Fabric Care (Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Additives, Laundry Detergents); Home Care (Air Care, Dish Care, P&G Professional, Surface Care); and • Baby, Feminine & Family Care : Baby Care (Baby Wipes, Taped Diapers and Pants); Feminine Care (Adult Incontinence, Feminine Care); Family Care (Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper).

Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill is allocated by reportable segment as follows: Beauty Grooming Health Care Fabric & Home Care Baby, Feminine & Family Care Total Company Goodwill at June 30, 2023 $ 13,888 $ 12,703 $ 7,718 $ 1,821 $ 4,529 $ 40,659 Acquisitions and divestitures — — — — — — Translation and other 99 71 56 6 25 257 Goodwill at December 31, 2023 $ 13,987 $ 12,774 $ 7,774 $ 1,827 $ 4,554 $ 40,916 Goodwill increased from June 30, 2023, due to currency translation. Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 8 The Procter & Gamble Company Identifiable intangible assets at December 31, 2023, were comprised of: Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Intangible assets with determinable lives $ 9,071 $ ( 6,444 ) Intangible assets with indefinite lives 19,675 — Total identifiable intangible assets $ 28,746 $ ( 6,444 ) Intangible assets with determinable lives consist of brands, patents, technology and customer relationships. The intangible assets with indefinite lives primarily consist of brands. The amortization expense of determinable-lived intangible assets for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, was $ 84 and $ 79 , respectively. For the six months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, amortization expense was $ 171 and $ 159 , respectively. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment. We use the income method to estimate the fair value of these assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. When appropriate, the market approach, which leverages comparable company revenue and earnings multiples, is weighted with the income approach to estimate fair value. If the resulting fair value is less than the asset's carrying value, that difference represents an impairment. Our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets occurs during the three months ended December 31. Most of our goodwill reporting units have fair value cushions that significantly exceed their underlying carrying values. During the three months ended December 31, 2023, we determined that the fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset was less than its carrying amount. As a result, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $ 1.3 billion ($ 1.0 billion after tax) to reduce the carrying amount to its estimated fair value during the quarter ended December 31, 2023. Following the impairment charge, the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is $ 12.8 billion. The impairment charge arose due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of a new restructuring program focused primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria. Adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment, including foreign currency devaluation, increasing global inflation, market contraction from an economic recession and the Russia-Ukraine War, could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset and trigger a further impairment charge. Further reduction of the Gillette business activities in Russia could reduce the estimated fair value. The Russia business accounted for approximately 4 % of Gillette net sales in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the net sales growth rates (including residual growth rates), discount rate and royalty rates. Net sales growth rates could be negatively impacted by reductions or changes in demand for our Gillette products, which may be caused by, among other things: changes in the use and frequency of grooming products, shifts in demand away from one or more of our higher priced products to lower priced products or potential supply chain constraints. In addition, relative global and country/regional macroeconomic factors, including the Russia-Ukraine War, could result in additional and prolonged devaluation of other countries' currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The residual growth rates represent the expected rate at which the Gillette brand is expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period. The residual growth rates utilized in our fair value estimates are consistent with the brand operating plans and approximate expected long-term category market growth rates. The residual growth rate depends on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, relative currency exchange rates and business activities that impact market share. As a result, the residual growth rate could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes, devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or an increased competitive environment. The discount rate, which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, such as further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar. Spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the U.S. The royalty rate used to determine the estimated fair value for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is driven by historical and estimated future profitability of the underlying Gillette business. The royalty rate may be impacted by significant adverse changes in long-term operating margins. Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. The Procter & Gamble Company 9 We performed a sensitivity analysis for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset as part of our annual impairment testing during the three months ended December 31, 2023, utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the discount rate, the short-term and residual growth rates and the royalty rate to demonstrate the potential impacts to estimated fair values. The table below provides, in isolation, the estimated fair value impacts related to a 25 basis-point increase in the discount rate, a 25 basis-point decrease in our short-term and residual growth rates or a 50 basis-point decrease in our royalty rate, which may result in an additional impairment of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset.

Earnings Per Share Basic net earnings per common share are calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble less preferred dividends by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net earnings per common share are calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble by the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The diluted shares include the dilutive effect of stock options and other share-based awards based on the treasury stock method and the assumed conversion of preferred stock. Net earnings per common share were calculated as follows: CONSOLIDATED AMOUNTS Three Months Ended December 31 Six Months Ended December 31 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net earnings $ 3,493 $ 3,959 $ 8,049 $ 7,922 Less: Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 25 26 60 50 Net earnings attributable to P&G (Diluted) 3,468 3,933 7,988 7,872 Less: Preferred dividends 70 70 140 141 Net earnings attributable to P&G available to common shareholders (Basic) $ 3,398 $ 3,863 $ 7,849 $ 7,731 SHARES IN MILLIONS Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 2,358.0 2,365.9 2,359.0 2,375.7 Add: Effect of dilutive securities Convertible preferred shares (1) 73.9 76.7 74.3 77.0 Stock options and other unvested equity awards (2) 36.4 38.6 38.5 39.7 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 2,468.4 2,481.2 2,471.8 2,492.4 NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE (3) Basic $ 1.44 $ 1.63 $ 3.33 $ 3.25 Diluted $ 1.40 $ 1.59 $ 3.23 $ 3.16 (1) An overview of preferred shares can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023.

Risk Management Activities and Fair Value Measurements As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. There have been no significant changes in our risk management policies or activities during the six months ended December 31, 2023. The Company has not changed its valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period. The Company recognizes transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of each quarter. There were no transfers between levels during the periods presented. Also, there was no significant activity within the Level 3 assets and liabilities during the periods presented. Except for the impairment of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset discussed in Note 4, there were no significant assets or liabilities that were re-measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the six months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. Cash equivalents were $ 6.3 billion and $ 6.8 billion as of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, respectively, and are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. The Company had no other material investments in debt or equity securities during the periods presented. The fair value of long-term debt was $ 25.6 billion and $ 26.9 billion as of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, respectively. This includes the current portion of long-term debt instruments ($ 3.4 billion and $ 3.9 billion as of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, respectively). Certain long-term debt (debt designated as a fair value hedge) is recorded at fair value. All other long-term debt is recorded at amortized cost but is measured at fair value for disclosure purposes. We consider our debt to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Fair values are generally estimated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments. Disclosures about Financial Instruments The notional amounts and fair values of financial instruments used in hedging transactions as of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, are as follows: Notional Amount Fair Value Asset Fair Value (Liability) December 31, 2023 June 30, 2023 December 31, 2023 June 30, 2023 December 31, 2023 June 30, 2023 DERIVATIVES IN FAIR VALUE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Interest rate contracts $ 3,098 $ 4,044 $ — $ — $ ( 317 ) $ ( 445 ) DERIVATIVES IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Foreign currency interest rate contracts $ 12,267 $ 11,005 $ 5 $ 26 $ ( 347 ) $ ( 631 ) TOTAL DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS $ 15,365 $ 15,049 $ 5 $ 26 $ ( 664 ) $ ( 1,076 ) DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS Foreign currency contracts $ 4,321 $ 3,489 $ 37 $ 7 $ ( 7 ) $ ( 42 ) TOTAL DERIVATIVES AT FAIR VALUE $ 19,686 $ 18,538 $ 42 $ 33 $ ( 671 ) $ ( 1,118 ) The fair value of the interest rate derivative asset/(liability) directly offsets the cumulative amount of the fair value hedging adjustment included in the carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation. The carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation, which includes the unamortized discount or premium and the fair value adjustment, was $ 2.8 billion and $ 3.6 billion as of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, respectively. In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges. The carrying value of those debt instruments designated as net investment hedges, which includes the adjustment for the foreign currency transaction gain or loss on those instruments, was $ 10.8 billion and $ 11.8 billion as of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, respectively. Derivative assets are presented in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Other noncurrent assets. Derivative liabilities are presented in Accrued and other liabilities or Other noncurrent liabilities. Changes in the fair value of net investment hedges are recognized in the Foreign currency translation component of Other comprehensive income (OCI). All of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Certain of the Company's financial instruments used in hedging transactions are governed by industry standard netting and collateral agreements with counterparties. If the Company's credit rating were to fall below the levels stipulated in the agreements, the counterparties could demand either collateralization or termination of the arrangements. The aggregate fair value of the instruments covered by these contractual features that are in a net liability position was $ 653 and $ 1,088 as of December 31, 2023 and June 30, 2023, respectively. The Company has not been required to post collateral as a result of these contractual features. Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. The Procter & Gamble Company 11 Before tax gains on our financial instruments in hedging relationships are categorized as follows: Amount of Loss Recognized in OCI on Derivatives Three Months Ended December 31 Six Months Ended December 31 2023 2022 2023 2022 DERIVATIVES IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS (1) (2) Foreign exchange contracts $ (487) $ (1,013) $ (202) $ (305) (1) For the derivatives in net investment hedging relationships, the amount of gain excluded from effectiveness testing, which was recognized in earnings, was $ 62 and $ 69 for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The amount of gain excluded from effectiveness testing was $ 130 and $ 115 for the six months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. (2) In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges. The amount of loss recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) for such instruments was $( 504 ) and $( 862 ) for the three months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The amount of loss recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) for such instruments was $( 159 ) and $( 164 ) for the six months ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

These are both recognized in Interest expense. The gains/(losses) on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is substantially offset by the currency mark-to-market of the related exposure. These are both recognized in Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A). 8. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss) The table below presents the changes in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) attributable to Procter & Gamble (AOCI), including the reclassifications out of AOCI by component: Investment Securities Postretirement Benefit Plans Foreign Currency Translation Total AOCI Balance at June 30, 2023 $ 13 $ 67 $ ( 12,300 ) $ ( 12,220 ) OCI before reclassifications (1) ( 2 ) ( 19 ) 83 62 Amounts reclassified to the Consolidated Statement of Earnings (2) — ( 11 ) — ( 11 ) Net current period OCI ( 2 ) ( 30 ) 83 51 Less: OCI attributable to noncontrolling interests — — ( 2 ) ( 2 ) Balance at December 31, 2023 $ 11 $ 37 $ ( 12,214 ) $ ( 12,167 ) (1) Net of tax (benefit)/expense of $ 0 , $( 9 ) and $( 85 ) for gains/losses on investment securities, postretirement benefit plans and foreign currency translation, respectively. Income tax effects within foreign currency translation include impacts from items such as net investment hedge transactions.

Postretirement benefit plan amounts are reclassified from AOCI into Other non-operating income, net and included in the computation of net periodic postretirement costs. 9. Commitments and Contingencies Litigation We are subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental, patent and trademark matters, labor and employment matters and tax. While considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management and our counsel, the ultimate resolution of the various lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 12 The Procter & Gamble Company We are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior manufacturing and waste disposal practices. Based on currently available information, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of environmental remediation will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Income Tax Uncertainties The Company is present in approximately 70 countries and over 150 taxable jurisdictions and, at any point in time, has 30 – 40 jurisdictional audits underway at various stages of completion. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite our belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitations. Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate. We have tax years open ranging from 2010 and forward. We are generally not able to reliably estimate the timing and ultimate settlement amounts until the close of an audit. Based on information currently available, we anticipate that over the next 12-month period, audit activity could be completed related to uncertain tax positions in multiple jurisdictions for which we have accrued existing liabilities of approximately $ 15 , including interest and penalties. Additional information on the Commitments and Contingencies of the Company can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. 10. Supplier Finance Programs The Company has an ongoing program to negotiate extended payment terms with its suppliers consistent with market practices. The Company also supports a Supply Chain Finance program (“SCF”) with several global financial institutions. Under SCF, the Company maintains an accounts payable system to facilitate participating suppliers' ability to sell receivables from the Company to a SCF bank. These participating suppliers negotiate their sales of receivables arrangements directly with the respective SCF bank. The Company is not party to those agreements, but the SCF banks allow the suppliers to utilize the Company’s creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs. Under this model, this arrangement generally provides the suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own. The Company has no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to sell a receivable. Once a qualifying supplier chooses to participate in SCF, the supplier selects which individual Company invoices to sell to the SCF bank. The Company’s obligations to its suppliers, including the amounts due and scheduled payment dates, are not impacted by the supplier’s decisions to finance amounts under these arrangements. The Company does not provide any form of guarantee under these financing arrangements. Our payment terms for suppliers under this program generally range from 60 to 180 days. All outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in SCF are recorded within Accounts payable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the associated payments are included in operating activities within our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The amount due to suppliers participating in SCF and included in Accounts payable was approximately $ 5.6 billion as of December 31, 2023, $ 5.7 billion as of June 30, 2023, and $ 5.8 billion as of June 30, 2022. 11. Restructuring Program The Company has historically incurred an ongoing annual level of restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Before tax costs incurred under the ongoing program have generally ranged from $ 250 to $ 500 annually. Consistent with our historical policies for restructuring-type activities, the restructuring program charges will be funded by and included within Corporate for management and segment reporting. In December 2023, the Company announced a limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria, to address challenging macroeconomic and fiscal conditions. In connection with this announcement, the Company expects to record incremental restructuring charges of $ 1.0 to $ 1.5 billion after tax, consisting primarily of foreign currency translation losses to be recognized as non-cash charges upon the substantial liquidation of operations in the affected markets. For the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company incurred charges of $ 89 including $ 48 in Costs of products sold and $ 39 in SG&A. For the six months ended December 31, 2023, the Company incurred charges of $ 181 including $ 109 in Costs of products sold and $ 68 in SG&A. Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. The Procter & Gamble Company 13 The following table presents restructuring activity for the six months ended December 31, 2023: Separation Costs Asset-Related Costs Other Costs Total RESERVE JUNE 30, 2023 $ 155 $ — $ 19 $ 174 Costs incurred for the three months ended September 30, 2023 69 12 11 92 Costs incurred for the three months ended December 31, 2023 40 30 19 89 Costs incurred for the six months ended December 31, 2023 109 42 30 181 Costs paid/settled for the six months ended December 31, 2023 ( 91 ) ( 42 ) ( 27 ) ( 160 ) RESERVE DECEMBER 31, 2023 $ 173 $ — $ 22 $ 195 Separation Costs Employee separation costs relate to severance packages that are primarily voluntary and the amounts calculated are based on salary levels and past service periods. Asset-Related Costs Asset-related costs consist of both asset write-downs and accelerated depreciation for manufacturing consolidations. Asset write-downs relate to the establishment of a new fair value basis for assets held-for-sale or for disposal. These assets are written down to the lower of their current carrying basis or amounts expected to be realized upon disposal, less minor disposal costs. Charges for accelerated depreciation relate to long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period. Other Costs Other restructuring-type charges are incurred as a direct result of the restructuring plan. Such charges include asset removal and termination of contracts related to supply chain and overhead optimization. Item 2.

Purpose, Approach and Non-GAAP Measures The purpose of Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is to provide an understanding of Procter & Gamble's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. The MD&A is organized in the following sections: • Overview • Summary of Results – Six Months Ended December 31, 2023 • Economic Conditions and Uncertainties • Results of Operations – Three and Six Months Ended December 31, 2023 • Segment Results – Three and Six Months Ended December 31, 2023 • Liquidity and Capital Resources • Measures Not Defined by U.S. GAAP Throughout the MD&A we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales, net earnings, diluted net earnings per common share (diluted EPS) and operating cash flow. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under U.S. GAAP, consisting of organic sales growth, Core earnings per share (Core EPS), adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity. The explanation at the end of the MD&A provides the definition of these non-GAAP measures, details on the use and the derivation of these measures, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and consumption in the MD&A are based on a combination of vendor-purchased traditional brick-and-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales of our products in dollar terms on a constant currency basis relative to all product sales in the category. The Company measures quarter and fiscal year to date market shares through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months as compared to the end of the reporting period. Management also uses unit volume growth to evaluate drivers of changes in net sales. Organic volume growth reflects year-over-year changes in unit volume excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and certain one-time items, if applicable, and is used to explain changes in organic sales. Certain columns and rows may not add due to rounding. OVERVIEW P&G is a global leader in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world.

The following table provides the percentage of net sales and net earnings by reportable business segment (excluding Corporate) for the three and six months ended December 31, 2023: Three Months Ended December 31, 2023 Six Months Ended December 31, 2023 Net Sales Net Earnings Net Sales Net Earnings Beauty 18 % 19 % 18 % 20 % Grooming 8 % 9 % 8 % 9 % Health Care 15 % 15 % 15 % 15 % Fabric & Home Care 35 % 34 % 35 % 33 % Baby, Feminine & Family Care 24 % 23 % 24 % 23 % Total Company 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % RECENT DEVELOPMENTS Limited Market Portfolio Restructuring In December 2023, the Company announced a limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria, to address challenging macroeconomic and fiscal conditions. In connection with this announcement, the Company expects to record incremental restructuring charges of $1.0 to $1.5 billion after tax, consisting primarily of foreign currency translation losses to be recognized as non-cash charges upon the substantial liquidation of operations in the affected markets. Although the timing of the completion of this restructuring program has yet to be determined, the Company currently anticipates that these restructuring charges will be recognized in the fiscal years ending June 30, 2024 and 2025. Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, resulting charges will be funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting. Restructuring charges above the normal ongoing level of restructuring costs will be reported as non-core charges. For more details on the restructuring program, refer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 16 The Procter & Gamble Company Intangible Asset Impairment During the three months ended December 31, 2023, the Company recorded a $1.3 billion before tax ($1.0 billion after tax) non-cash impairment charge, on intangible assets acquired as part of the Company’s 2005 acquisition of The Gillette Company. The impairment charge arose from a reduction in the estimated fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of the non-core restructuring program described above. This impairment charge adjusted the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset to fair value. For a more detailed discussion of the Gillette impairment, refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. SUMMARY OF RESULTS – Six Months Ended December 31, 2023 The following are highlights of results for the six months ended December 31, 2023, versus the six months ended December 31, 2022: • Net sales increased 5% to $43.3 billion versus the prior year period. Net sales increased high single digits in Health Care and Fabric & Home Care, mid-single digits in Grooming and low single digits in Baby, Feminine & Family Care and Beauty. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, also increased 5%. Organic sales increased high single digits in Grooming and Fabric & Home Care, mid-single digits in Health Care and Baby, Feminine & Family Care and low single digits in Beauty. • Net earnings were $8.0 billion, an increase of $127 million, or 2%, versus the prior year period due to the increase in net sales, partially offset by the non-cash impairment charge of $1.0 billion after taxes related to the Gillette intangible asset. • Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble were $8.0 billion, an increase of $116 million, or 1%, versus the prior year period. • Diluted EPS increased 2% to $3.23 due to the increase in net earnings . Core EPS, which excludes the charge for the Gillette intangible asset impairment and incremental restructuring, increased 16% to $3.66. • Operating cash flow was $10.0 billion. Adjusted free cash flow, which is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the U.S. Tax Act, was $8.7 billion. Adjusted free cash flow productivity, which is defined as adjusted free cash flow as a percentage of net earnings excluding the Gillette intangible asset impairment charge, was 96%. ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTI ES Global Economic Conditions. Our products are sold in numerous countries across North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia, Australia and Africa, with more than half our sales generated outside the United States. Our largest international markets are Greater China, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan and Germany and collectively comprised more than 20% of our net sales in the fiscal year 2023. As such, we are exposed to and impacted by global macroeconomic factors, geopolitical tensions, U.S. and foreign government policies and foreign exchange fluctuations. We are also exposed to market risks from operating in challenging environments including unstable economic, political and social conditions, civil unrest, military conflicts, natural disasters, debt and credit issues and currency controls or fluctuations. These risks can reduce our net sales or erode our operating margins and consequently reduce our net earnings and cash flows. Changes in Costs. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity and input material prices, transportation costs, other broader inflationary impacts and our own productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities and input materials, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp. Volatility in the market price of these commodities and input materials has a direct impact on our costs. Disruptions in our manufacturing, supply and distribution operations due to energy shortages, natural disasters, labor or freight constraints could also lead to increased costs. New or increased legal or regulatory requirements, along with initiatives to meet our sustainability goals, could also result in increased costs due to higher material costs and investments in facilities and equipment. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. Increased pricing in response to certain inflationary or cost increases may also offset portions of the cost impacts; however, such price increases may impact product consumption. If we are unable to manage cost impacts through pricing actions and consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. Foreign Exchange. We have significant translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates. Translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation of transaction-related working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. In the past three years, weakening of certain foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar has resulted in significant foreign exchange impacts leading to lower net sales, net earnings and cash flows. These fluctuations have significantly impacted our historical net sales, net earnings and cash flows and could do so in the future. Certain countries that are currently experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations include Argentina, Russia and Turkey. Increased pricing in response to certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency The Procter & Gamble Company 17 impacts but could also have a negative impact on the consumption of our products, which would negatively affect our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. Government Policies. Our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government legislative, regulatory or enforcement policies. For example, our net earnings and cash flows could be affected by any future legislative or regulatory changes in U.S. or non-U.S. tax policy, including changes resulting from the current work being led by the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework focused on ""Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy."" The breadth of the OECD project extends beyond pure digital businesses and is likely to impact most large multinational businesses by both redefining jurisdictional taxation rights and establishing a 15% global minimum tax. Our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows may also be impacted by changes in U.S. and foreign government policies related to environmental and climate change matters. Additionally, we attempt to carefully manage our debt, currency and other exposures in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and pricing controls, such as Argentina, Egypt and Pakistan. Further, our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes to international trade agreements in North America and elsewhere. Changes in government policies in the above areas might cause an increase or decrease in our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. Russia-Ukraine War. The war between Russia and Ukraine has negatively impacted our operations. Our Ukraine business includes two manufacturing sites and accounted for less than 1% of consolidated net sales and consolidated net earnings in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. Net assets of our Ukraine business accounted for less than 1% of consolidated net assets as of December 31, 2023. Our Russia business includes two manufacturing sites. Beginning in March 2022, the Company reduced its product portfolio, discontinued new capital investments and suspended media, advertising and promotional activity in Russia. The Russia business accounted for approximately 2% of consolidated net sales and consolidated net earnings in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. Net assets of our Russia business accounted for less than 2% of consolidated net assets as of December 31, 2023. Future impacts to the Company are difficult to predict due to the high level of uncertainty related to the war’s duration, evolution and ultimate resolution. Within Ukraine, there is a possibility of physical damage and destruction of our two manufacturing facilities. We may not be able to operate our manufacturing sites and source raw materials from our suppliers or ship finished products to our customers. Within Russia, we may not be able to continue our reduced operations at current levels due to sanctions and counter-sanctions, monetary, currency or payment controls, legislative restrictions or policies, restrictions on access to financial institutions and supply and transportation challenges. Our suppliers, distributors and retail customers are also impacted by the war and their ability to successfully maintain their operations could also impact our operations or negatively impact the sales of our products. More broadly, there could be additional negative impacts to our net sales, earnings and cash flows should the situation escalate beyond its current scope, including, among other potential impacts, economic recessions in certain neighboring countries or globally due to inflationary pressures and supply chain cost increases or the geographic proximity of the war relative to the rest of Europe. For additional information on risk factors that could impact our business results, please refer to Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. 18 The Procter & Gamble Company RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Three Months Ended December 31, 2023 The following discussion provides a review of results for the three months ended December 31, 2023, versus the three months ended December 31, 2022. Three Months Ended December 31 Amounts in millions, except per share amounts 2023 2022 % Chg Net sales $ 21,441 $ 20,773 3% Operating income 4,433 4,785 (7)% Earnings before income taxes 4,496 4,835 (7)% Net earnings 3,493 3,959 (12)% Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 3,468 3,933 (12)% Diluted net earnings per common share 1.40 1.59 (12)% Core net earnings per common share 1.84 1.59 16% Three Months Ended December 31 COMPARISONS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES 2023 2022 Basis Pt Chg Gross margin 52.7 % 47.5 % 520 Selling, general & administrative expense 25.8 % 24.5 % 130 Operating income 20.7 % 23.0 % (230) Earnings before income taxes 21.0 % 23.3 % (230) Net earnings 16.3 % 19.1 % (280) Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 16.2 % 18.9 % (270) Net Sales Net sales for the quarter increased 3% to $21.4 billion. The increase in net sales was due to higher pricing of 4%, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange of 1%. Unit volume and mix were unchanged. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, organic sales increased 4% while organic volume declined by 1%. The following table summarizes key drivers of the change in net sales by reportable segment: Net Sales Change Drivers 2023 vs. 2022 (Three Months Ended December 31) (1) Volume with Acquisitions & Divestitures Volume Excluding Acquisitions & Divestitures Foreign Exchange Price Mix Other (2) Net Sales Growth Beauty — % (1) % (1) % 4 % (3) % 1 % 1 % Grooming 1 % 1 % (3) % 7 % 1 % — % 6 % Health Care (3) % (4) % 2 % 5 % 1 % (1) % 4 % Fabric & Home Care — % 1 % — % 4 % 1 % — % 5 % Baby, Feminine & Family Care (2) % (2) % (1) % 4 % 1 % — % 2 % Total Company — % (1) % (1) % 4 % — % — % 3 % (1) Net sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied. (2) Other includes the sales mix impact from acquisitions and divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile volume to net sales. Operating Costs Gross margin increased 520 basis points to 52.7% of net sales for the quarter. The increase in gross margin was due to: • 240 basis points of manufacturing productivity savings, • 200 basis points of lower commodity costs and • a 190 basis-point increase due to higher pricing. These impacts were partially offset by: • a 70 basis-point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, • 20 basis points of product and packaging investments and • 20 basis points of rounding and other impacts. The Procter & Gamble Company 19 Total SG&A spending increased 8% to $5.5 billion versus the prior year period due to increased marketing spending and overhead costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased 130 basis points to 25.8% due to the increase in marketing spending as a percentage of sales. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales increased 140 basis points as the increase in marketing spending was partially offset by the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and productivity savings. Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales were unchanged as wage inflation, foreign exchange and other cost increases were offset by the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and productivity savings. Productivity-driven cost savings delivered 100 basis points of benefit to SG&A as a percentage of net sales. The Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $1.3 billion ($1.0 billion after tax) on the Gillette intangible asset. The impairment charge arose from a reduction in the estimated fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of the limited market portfolio restructuring program focused primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria. For further discussion of the Gillette impairment charge, refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Non-Operating Expenses and Income Interest expense was $ 248 million for the quarter, an increase of $77 million versus the prior year period due primarily to higher interest rates. Interest income was $ 133 million for the quarter, an increase of $67 million versus the prior year period due primarily to higher interest rates. Other non-operating income was $ 177 million, which is an increase of $22 million versus the prior year period. Income Taxes The effective income tax rate for the three months ended December 31, 2023, was 22.3%, compared to 18.1% for the three months ended December 31, 2022. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by 180 basis points due to the net impact of the prior year recognition of operating loss carryforwards and 180 basis points due to unfavorable geographic mix impacts. Net Earnings Operating income decreased $352 million, or 7%, to $4.4 billion for the quarter, due to the non-cash, before tax impairment charge to the Gillette intangible asset of $1.3 billion and an increase in SG&A spending as a percentage of net sales. This was partially offset by the increase in net sales, along with the increase in gross margin, all of which are discussed above. Net earnings decreased $466 million, or 12%, to $3.5 billion due to the decrease in operating income and an increase in the effective tax rate. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of approximately $78 million on net earnings for the quarter, including both transactional and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars. Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble decreased $465 million, or 12%, to $3.5 billion for the quarter. Diluted EPS decreased 12% to $1.40 versus the prior year period due to the decrease in net earnings. Core EPS, which represents diluted EPS excluding charges for the Gillette intangible asset impairment and incremental restructuring, increased 16% to $1.84. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Six Months Ended December 31, 2023 The following discussion provides a review of results for the six months ended December 31, 2023, versus the six months ended December 31, 2022.

The increase in net sales was due to higher pricing of 6%, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange of 1% and a 1% decrease in unit volume. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, organic sales also increased 5%. The following table summarizes key drivers of the change in net sales by reportable segment: Net Sales Change Drivers 2023 vs. 2022 (Six Months Ended December 31) (1) Volume with Acquisitions & Divestitures Volume Excluding Acquisitions & Divestitures Foreign Exchange Price Mix Other (2) Net Sales Growth Beauty — % — % (2) % 5 % (2) % 1 % 2 % Grooming (1) % (1) % (3) % 8 % 1 % 1 % 6 % Health Care (1) % (1) % 2 % 5 % 2 % — % 8 % Fabric & Home Care — % — % (1) % 6 % 1 % 1 % 7 % Baby, Feminine & Family Care (2) % (3) % (1) % 6 % 1 % (1) % 3 % Total Company (1) % (1) % (1) % 6 % — % 1 % 5 % (1) Net sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied. (2) Other includes the sales mix impact from acquisitions and divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile volume to net sales. Operating Costs Gross margin increased 480 basis points to 52.3% of net sales for the period. The increase in gross margin was due to: • a 250 basis-point increase due to higher pricing, • 180 basis points of lower commodity costs and • 180 basis points of manufacturing productivity savings. These impacts were partially offset by: • a 60 basis-point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, • a 30 basis-point decline from unfavorable product mix including the decline of the super-premium SK-II brand, • 30 basis points of product and packaging investments and • 10 basis points of decline from loss of manufacturing scale benefits. Total SG&A spending increased 12% to $11.1 billion versus the prior year period due to increased marketing spending, overhead costs and other operating costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased 170 basis points to 25.7% due to the increase in marketing spending, overhead spending and other operating costs as a percentage of sales. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales increased 140 basis points as the increase in marketing spending was partially offset by the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and productivity savings. Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales increased 20 basis points due to wage inflation and other cost increases, partially offset by the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and productivity savings. Other operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 20 basis points. Productivity-driven cost savings delivered 80 basis points of benefit to SG&A as a percentage of net sales. The Company recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $1.3 billion ($1.0 billion after tax) on the Gillette intangible asset. The impairment charge arose from a reduction in the estimated fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of the limited market portfolio restructuring program. For further discussion of the Gillette impairment charge, refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The Procter & Gamble Company 21 Non-Operating Expenses and Income Interest expense was $ 472 million for the period, an increase of $178 million versus the prior year period due primarily to higher interest rates. Interest income was $ 262 million for the period, an increase of $154 million versus the prior year period due primarily to higher interest rates. Other non-operating income was $ 309 million, which is an increase of $15 million versus the prior year period. Income Taxes The effective income tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2023, was 21.8%, compared to 19.4% for the six months ended December 31, 2022. The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by 90 basis points due to the net impact of the prior year recognition of operating loss carryforwards and 150 basis points due to unfavorable geographic mix impacts. Net Earnings Operating income increased $476 million, or 5%, to $10.2 billion for the period, due to the increase in net sales and the increase in gross margin, the components of which are described above. These benefits were partially offset by non-cash before tax impairment charges of $1.3 billion related to Gillette intangible asset and an increase in SG&A spending as a percentage of net sales. Net earnings increased $127 million, or 2%, to $8.0 billion, as the increase in operating income was partially offset by an increase in the effective tax rate. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of approximately $249 million on net earnings for the period, including both transactional and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars. Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $116 million, or 1%, to $8.0 billion for the quarter. Diluted EPS increased 2% to $3.23 versus the prior year period due to the increase in net earnings and a reduction in the weighted average number of shares outstanding. Core EPS, which represents diluted EPS excluding charges for incremental restructuring and the impairment of the Gillette intangible asset, increased 16% to $3.66. SEGMENT RESULTS – Three and Six Months Ended December 31, 2023 The following discussion provides a review of results by reportable business segment.

Corporate Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business segments. These include but are not limited to incidental businesses managed at the corporate level, gains and losses related to certain divested brands or businesses, impacts from various financing and investing activities, impacts related to employee benefits, asset impairments and restructuring activities including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used within the reportable segments to U.S. GAAP. The most notable ongoing reconciling item is income taxes, which adjusts the blended statutory rates that are reflected in the reportable segments to the overall Company effective tax rate. For the three months ended December 31, 2023, Corporate net sales decreased $49 million to $126 million due to a decrease in net sales of incidental businesses managed at the corporate level. Corporate net earnings decreased to a loss of $1.2 billion for the quarter due to the impairment of the Gillette intangible asset, increased interest expense and higher restructuring charges. For the six months ended December 31, 2023, Corporate net sales decreased $158 million to $270 million due to a decrease in net sales of incidental businesses managed at the corporate level. Corporate net earnings decreased to a loss of $1.4 billion due to the impairment charge of the Gillette intangible asset, increased interest expense and higher restructuring charges. LIQUIDITY & CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating Activities Operating cash flow was $10.0 billion fiscal year to date, an increase of $2.4 billion versus the prior year period. Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, intangible asset impairment, and share-based compensation expense), generated $10.9 billion of operating cash flow. Working capital and other impacts used $927 million of cash in the period primarily driven by an increase in accounts receivable from sales growth, a reduction in salary related liabilities due to the excess of payment over accruals, and a reduction in postretirement benefit accruals resulting from the net periodic benefit credit and payments. This is partially offset by the impact of our supplier finance program (see Note 10, Supplier Finance Programs). Days sales outstanding and Days inventory on hand increased by three days. Investing Activities Investing activities used $2.2 billion of cash fiscal year to date primarily driven by capital expenditures and the settlement of net investment hedges. Financing Activities Financing activities used $8.1 billion of net cash fiscal year to date, mainly due to dividends to shareholders, treasury stock purchases, and a net debt decrease, partially offset by the impact of stock options and other. As of December 31, 2023, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $12.8 billion. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements. MEASURES NOT DEFINED BY U.S. GAAP In accordance with the SEC's Regulation S-K Item 10(e), the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measure. We believe that these measures provide useful perspective on underlying business trends (i.e., trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and results and provide a supplemental measure of period-to-period results. The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors, as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measures but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted. The Procter & Gamble Company 27 Organic sales growth. Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. This measure is used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of organic sales growth to reported net sales growth: Three Months Ended December 31, 2023 Net Sales Growth Foreign Exchange Impact Acquisition & Divestiture Impact/Other (1) Organic Sales Growth Beauty 1 % 1 % (1) % 1 % Grooming 6 % 3 % — % 9 % Health Care 4 % (2) % — % 2 % Fabric & Home Care 5 % — % 1 % 6 % Baby, Feminine & Family Care 2 % 1 % — % 3 % Total Company 3 % 1 % — % 4 % (1) Acquisition & Divestiture Impact/Other includes the volume and mix impact of acquisitions and divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales.

Adjusted free cash flow. Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the U.S. Tax Act. Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow ($ millions): Six Months Ended December 31, 2023 Operating Cash Flow Capital Spending U.S. Tax Act Payments Adjusted Free Cash Flow $ 10,004 $ ( 1,742 ) $ 422 $ 8,684 Adjusted free cash flow productivity. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the Gillette intangible asset impairment charge. We view adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G’s ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, in allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. This measure is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow productivity ($ millions): Six Months Ended December 31, 2023 Adjusted Free Cash Flow Net Earnings Adjustments to Net Earnings (1) Net Earnings as Adjusted Adjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity $ 8,684 $ 8,049 $ 1,026 $ 9,075 96 % (1) Adjustments to Net Earnings relate to the Gillette intangible asset impairment charge announced in December 2023. Core EPS. Core EPS is a measure of the Company's diluted EPS excluding items that are not judged by management to be part of the Company's sustainable results or trends. Management views this non-GAAP measure as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time. This measure is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. The Core earnings measures included in the following reconciliation tables refer to the equivalent GAAP measures adjusted as applicable for the following items: 28 The Procter & Gamble Company • Incremental restructuring : The Company has historically had an ongoing level of restructuring activities of approximately $250 - $500 million before tax. On December 5, 2023, the Company announced a limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria. The adjustment to Core earnings includes the restructuring charges that exceed the normal, recurring level of restructuring charges. • Intangible asset impairment : As discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company recognized in the three months ended December 31, 2023, a non-cash, after-tax impairment charge of $1.0 billion ($1.3 billion before tax) to adjust the carrying value of the Gillette intangible asset acquired as part of the Company's 2005 acquisition of The Gillette Company.

We have prepared these statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (U.S. GAAP) pursuant to the rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for interim financial information. Note that certain columns and rows may not add due to rounding. In the opinion of management, the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements contain all normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods reported.

New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies In September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2022-04, ""Liabilities - Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations"". This guidance requires annual and interim disclosures for entities that use supplier finance programs in connection with the purchase of goods and services. This ASU was effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, except for the amendment on rollforward information, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. We adopted this ASU effective July 1, 2023, except for the amendment on rollforward information, which will be adopted July 1, 2024. See Note 10, Supplier Finance Programs, for the disclosure. No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had, or is expected to have, a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 3. Segment Information Under U.S. GAAP, our operating segments are aggregated into five reportable segments: 1) Beauty, 2) Grooming, 3) Health Care, 4) Fabric & Home Care and 5) Baby, Feminine & Family Care.

Goodwill and Intangible Assets Goodwill is allocated by reportable segment as follows: Beauty Grooming Health Care Fabric & Home Care Baby, Feminine & Family Care Total Company Goodwill at June 30, 2023 $ 13,888 $ 12,703 $ 7,718 $ 1,821 $ 4,529 $ 40,659 Acquisitions and divestitures — — — — — — Translation and other ( 152 ) ( 109 ) ( 100 ) ( 14 ) ( 44 ) ( 420 ) Goodwill at September 30, 2023 $ 13,736 $ 12,594 $ 7,618 $ 1,807 $ 4,485 $ 40,239 Goodwill decreased from June 30, 2023, primarily due to currency translation. Identifiable intangible assets at September 30, 2023, were comprised of: Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Intangible assets with determinable lives $ 8,990 $ ( 6,308 ) Intangible assets with indefinite lives 20,955 — Total identifiable intangible assets $ 29,945 $ ( 6,308 ) Intangible assets with determinable lives consist of brands, patents, technology and customer relationships. The intangible assets with indefinite lives primarily consist of brands. The amortization expense of determinable-lived intangible assets for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, was $ 87 and $ 80 , respectively. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment. We use the income method to estimate the fair value of these assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. If the resulting fair value is less than the asset's carrying value, that difference represents an impairment. Our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets occurs during the three months ended December 31. Most of our goodwill reporting units have fair value cushions that significantly exceed their underlying carrying values. The Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is most susceptible to future impairment risk. Based on our latest annual impairment testing performed during the three months ended December 31, 2022, the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset's fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 5 %. As of September 30, 2023, the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset was $ 14.1 billion. We concluded that no triggering event has occurred during the quarter ended September 30, 2023. Adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment, including foreign currency devaluation, increasing global inflation, market contraction from an economic recession and the Russia-Ukraine War, could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset and trigger a future Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. The Procter & Gamble Company 7 impairment charge. Further reduction of the Gillette business activities in Russia could reduce the estimated fair value by up to 5 %. The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the net sales growth rates (including residual growth rates), discount rate and royalty rates. Net sales growth rates could be negatively impacted by reductions or changes in demand for our Gillette products, which may be caused by, among other things: changes in the use and frequency of grooming products, shifts in demand away from one or more of our higher priced products to lower priced products or potential supply chain constraints. In addition, relative global and country/regional macroeconomic factors, including the Russia-Ukraine War, could result in additional and prolonged devaluation of other countries' currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The residual growth rates represent the expected rate at which the Gillette brand is expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period. The residual growth rates utilized in our fair value estimates are consistent with the brand operating plans and approximate expected long-term category market growth rates. The residual growth rate depends on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, relative currency exchange rates and business activities that impact market share. As a result, the residual growth rate could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes, devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or an increased competitive environment. The discount rate, which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, such as further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar. Spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the U.S. The royalty rate used to determine the estimated fair value for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is driven by historical and estimated future profitability of the underlying Gillette business. The royalty rate may be impacted by significant adverse changes in long-term operating margins. We performed a sensitivity analysis for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset as part of our annual impairment testing during the three months ended December 31, 2022, utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the discount rate, the short-term and residual growth rates and the royalty rates to demonstrate the potential impacts to estimated fair values. The table below provides, in isolation, the estimated fair value impacts related to a 25 basis-point increase in the discount rate, a 25 basis-point decrease in our short-term and residual growth rates or a 50 basis-point decrease in our royalty rates, which may result in an impairment of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset. Approximate Percent Change in Estimated Fair Value +25 bps Discount Rate -25 bps Growth Rates -50 bps Royalty Rate Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset ( 6 ) % ( 6 ) % ( 4 ) % Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 8 The Procter & Gamble Company 5. Earnings Per Share Basic net earnings per common share are calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble less preferred dividends by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net earnings per common share are calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble by the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The diluted shares include the dilutive effect of stock options and other share-based awards based on the treasury stock method and the assumed conversion of preferred stock. Net earnings per common share were calculated as follows: CONSOLIDATED AMOUNTS Three Months Ended September 30 2023 2022 Net earnings $ 4,556 $ 3,963 Less: Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 35 24 Net earnings attributable to P&G (Diluted) 4,521 3,939 Less: Preferred dividends 70 71 Net earnings attributable to P&G available to common shareholders (Basic) $ 4,450 $ 3,868 SHARES IN MILLIONS Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 2,360.0 2,385.5 Add: Effect of dilutive securities Convertible preferred shares (1) 74.6 77.4 Stock options and other unvested equity awards (2) 40.6 40.7 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 2,475.2 2,503.6 NET EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE (3) Basic $ 1.89 $ 1.62 Diluted $ 1.83 $ 1.57 (1) An overview of preferred shares can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023.

Share-Based Compensation and Postretirement Benefits The following table provides a summary of our share-based compensation expense and postretirement benefit impacts: Three Months Ended September 30 2023 2022 Share-based compensation expense $ 125 $ 105 Net periodic benefit cost for pension benefits 57 43 Net periodic benefit credit for other retiree benefits ( 156 ) ( 132 ) 7. Risk Management Activities and Fair Value Measurements As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. There have been no significant changes in our risk management policies or activities during the three months ended September 30, 2023. The Company has not changed its valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period. The Company recognizes transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of each quarter. There were no transfers between levels during the periods presented. Also, there was no significant activity within the Level 3 assets and liabilities during the periods presented. There were no significant assets or liabilities that were remeasured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the periods presented. Cash equivalents were $ 8.1 billion and $ 6.8 billion as of September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023, respectively, and are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. The Company had no other material investments in debt or equity securities during the periods presented. Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. The Procter & Gamble Company 9 The fair value of long-term debt was $ 25.1 billion and $ 26.9 billion as of September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023, respectively. This includes the current portion of long-term debt instruments ($ 3.0 billion and $ 3.9 billion as of September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023, respectively). Certain long-term debt (debt designated as a fair value hedge) is recorded at fair value. All other long-term debt is recorded at amortized cost but is measured at fair value for disclosure purposes. We consider our debt to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Fair values are generally estimated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments. Disclosures about Financial Instruments The notional amounts and fair values of financial instruments used in hedging transactions as of September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023, are as follows: Notional Amount Fair Value Asset Fair Value (Liability) September 30, 2023 June 30, 2023 September 30, 2023 June 30, 2023 September 30, 2023 June 30, 2023 DERIVATIVES IN FAIR VALUE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Interest rate contracts $ 2,961 $ 4,044 $ — $ — $ ( 434 ) $ ( 445 ) DERIVATIVES IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Foreign currency interest rate contracts $ 13,207 $ 11,005 $ 211 $ 26 $ ( 230 ) $ ( 631 ) TOTAL DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS $ 16,168 $ 15,049 $ 211 $ 26 $ ( 664 ) $ ( 1,076 ) DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS Foreign currency contracts $ 4,310 $ 3,489 $ 4 $ 7 $ ( 34 ) $ ( 42 ) TOTAL DERIVATIVES AT FAIR VALUE $ 20,478 $ 18,538 $ 216 $ 33 $ ( 698 ) $ ( 1,118 ) The fair value of the interest rate derivative asset/(liability) directly offsets the cumulative amount of the fair value hedging adjustment included in the carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation. The carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation, which includes the unamortized discount or premium and the fair value adjustment, was $ 2.5 billion and $ 3.6 billion as of September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023, respectively. In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges. The carrying value of those debt instruments designated as net investment hedges, which includes the adjustment for the foreign currency transaction gain or loss on those instruments, was $ 11.5 billion and $ 11.8 billion as of September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023, respectively. The increase in the derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges is primarily driven by the Company's decision to leverage favorable interest rate spreads in the foreign currency swap market. Derivative assets are presented in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Other noncurrent assets. Derivative liabilities are presented in Accrued and other liabilities or Other noncurrent liabilities. Changes in the fair value of net investment hedges are recognized in the Foreign currency translation component of Other comprehensive income (OCI). All of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Certain of the Company's financial instruments used in hedging transactions are governed by industry standard netting and collateral agreements with counterparties. If the Company's credit rating were to fall below the levels stipulated in the agreements, the counterparties could demand either collateralization or termination of the arrangements. The aggregate fair value of the instruments covered by these contractual features that are in a net liability position was $ 513 and $ 1,088 as of September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023, respectively. The Company has not been required to post collateral as a result of these contractual features. Before tax gains on our financial instruments in hedging relationships are categorized as follows: Amount of Gain Recognized in OCI on Derivatives Three Months Ended September 30 2023 2022 DERIVATIVES IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS (1) (2) Foreign exchange contracts $ 285 $ 708 (1) For the derivatives in net investment hedging relationships, the amount of gain excluded from effectiveness testing, which was recognized in earnings, was $ 67 and $ 46 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. (2) In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges. The amount of gain/(loss) recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) for such instruments was $ 344 and $ 698 for the three months ended September 30, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. 10 The Procter & Gamble Company Amount of Gain/(Loss) Recognized in Earnings Three Months Ended September 30 2023 2022 DERIVATIVES IN FAIR VALUE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Interest rate contracts $ 11 $ ( 131 ) DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS Foreign currency contracts $ ( 71 ) $ ( 146 ) The loss on the derivatives in fair value hedging relationships is fully offset by the mark-to-market impact of the related exposure. These are both recognized in Interest expense. The loss on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is substantially offset by the currency mark-to-market of the related exposure. These are both recognized in Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A). 8. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss) The table below presents the changes in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) attributable to Procter & Gamble (AOCI), including the reclassifications out of AOCI by component: Investment Securities Postretirement Benefit Plans Foreign Currency Translation Total AOCI Balance at June 30, 2023 $ 13 $ 67 $ ( 12,300 ) $ ( 12,220 ) OCI before reclassifications (1) ( 1 ) 44 ( 409 ) ( 367 ) Amounts reclassified to the Consolidated Statement of Earnings (2) — 1 — 1 Net current period OCI ( 1 ) 45 ( 409 ) ( 366 ) Less: OCI attributable to noncontrolling interests — — ( 2 ) ( 2 ) Balance at September 30, 2023 $ 11 $ 112 $ ( 12,707 ) $ ( 12,583 ) (1) Net of tax (benefit)/expense of $ 0 , $ 22 and $ 148 for gains/losses on investment securities, postretirement benefit plans and foreign currency translation, respectively. Income tax effects within foreign currency translation include impacts from items such as net investment hedge transactions. (2) Net of tax (benefit)/expense of $ 0 , $( 2 ) and $ 0 for gains/losses on investment securities, postretirement benefit plans and foreign currency translation, respectively. Postretirement benefit plan amounts are reclassified from AOCI into Other non-operating income, net and included in the computation of net periodic postretirement costs. 9. Commitments and Contingencies Litigation We are subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental, patent and trademark matters, labor and employment matters and tax. While considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management and our counsel, the ultimate resolution of the various lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior manufacturing and waste disposal practices. Based on currently available information, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of environmental remediation will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Income Tax Uncertainties The Company is present in approximately 70 countries and over 150 taxable jurisdictions and, at any point in time, has 30 – 40 jurisdictional audits underway at various stages of completion. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite our belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitations. Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate. We have tax years open ranging from 2010 and forward. We are generally not able to reliably estimate the timing and ultimate settlement amounts until the close of an audit. Additional information on the Commitments and Contingencies of the Company can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. Amounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified. The Procter & Gamble Company 11 10. Supplier Finance Programs The Company has an ongoing program to negotiate extended payment terms with its suppliers consistent with market practices. The Company also supports a Supply Chain Finance program (“SCF”) with several global financial institutions. Under SCF, the Company maintains an accounts payable system to facilitate participating suppliers' ability to sell receivables from the Company to an SCF bank. These participating suppliers negotiate their sales of receivables arrangements directly with the respective SCF bank. The Company is not party to those agreements, but the SCF banks allow the suppliers to utilize the Company’s creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs. Under this model, this arrangement generally provides the suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own. The Company has no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to sell a receivable. Once a qualifying supplier chooses to participate in SCF, the supplier selects which individual Company invoices to sell to the SCF bank. The Company’s obligations to its suppliers, including the amounts due and scheduled payment dates, are not impacted by the supplier’s decisions to finance amounts under these arrangements. The Company does not provide any form of guarantee under these financing arrangements. Our payment terms for suppliers under this program generally range from 60 to 180 days. All outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in SCF are recorded within Accounts payable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the associated payments are included in operating activities within our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The amount due to suppliers participating in SCF and included in Accounts payable was approximately $ 5.7 billion as of September 30, 2023 and June 30, 2023, and $ 5.8 billion as of June 30, 2022.

Purpose, Approach and Non-GAAP Measures The purpose of Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is to provide an understanding of Procter & Gamble's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. The MD&A is organized in the following sections: • Overview • Summary of Results – Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 • Economic Conditions and Uncertainties • Results of Operations – Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 • Segment Results – Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 • Liquidity and Capital Resources • Measures Not Defined by U.S. GAAP Throughout the MD&A we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales, net earnings, diluted net earnings per common share (diluted EPS) and operating cash flow. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under U.S. GAAP, consisting of organic sales growth, Core earnings per share (Core EPS), adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity. The explanation at the end of the MD&A provides the definition of these non-GAAP measures, details on the use and the derivation of these measures, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and consumption in the MD&A are based on a combination of vendor-purchased traditional brick-and-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales of our products in dollar terms on a constant currency basis relative to all product sales in the category. The Company measures quarter and fiscal year to date market shares through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months as compared to the end of the reporting period. Management also uses unit volume growth to evaluate drivers of changes in net sales. Organic volume growth reflects year-over-year changes in unit volume excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and certain one-time items, if applicable, and is used to explain changes in organic sales. Certain columns and rows may not add due to rounding. OVERVIEW P&G is a global leader in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world.

We also sell direct to individual consumers. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries. Our market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We believe we are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position. The table below lists our reportable segments, including the product categories and brand composition within each segment.

The following table provides the percentage of net sales and net earnings by reportable business segment (excluding Corporate) for the three months ended September 30, 2023: Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Net Sales Net Earnings Beauty 19 % 20 % Grooming 8 % 9 % Health Care 14 % 15 % Fabric & Home Care 35 % 33 % Baby, Feminine & Family Care 24 % 23 % Total Company 100 % 100 % SUMMARY OF RESULTS – Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 The following are highlights of results for the three months ended September 30, 2023, versus the three months ended September 30, 2022: • Net sales increased 6% to $21.9 billion versus the prior year period. Net sales increased double digits in Health Care, high single digits in Fabric & Home Care, mid-single digits in Grooming and Baby, Feminine & Family Care and low single digits in Beauty. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, increased 7%. Organic sales increased double digits in Health Care, high single digits in Fabric & Home Care, Grooming and Baby, Feminine & Family Care and mid-single digits in Beauty. • Net earnings were $4.6 billion, an increase of $593 million, or 15%, versus the prior year period due to the increase in net sales and an increase in operating margin. • Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble were $4.5 billion, an increase of $582 million, or 15%, versus the prior year period. • Diluted EPS increased 17% to $1.83 due to the increase in net earnings and a reduction in the weighted average shares outstanding. • Operating cash flow was $4.9 billion. Adjusted free cash flow, which is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excluding payments for the transitional tax payments resulting from the U.S. Tax Act, was $4.4 billion. Adjusted free cash flow productivity, which is defined as adjusted free cash flow as a percentage of net earnings, was 97%. ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTI ES Global Economic Conditions. Our products are sold in numerous countries across North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia, Australia and Africa, with more than half our sales generated outside the United States. Our largest international markets are Greater China, the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan and Germany and collectively comprised more than 20% of our net sales in the fiscal year 2023. As such, we are exposed to and impacted by global macroeconomic factors, geopolitical tensions, U.S. and foreign government policies and foreign exchange fluctuations. We are also exposed to market risks from operating in challenging environments including unstable economic, political and social conditions, civil unrest, military conflicts, natural disasters, debt and credit issues and currency controls or fluctuations. These risks can reduce our net sales or erode our operating margins and consequently reduce our net earnings and cash flows. Changes in Costs. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity and input material prices, transportation costs, other broader inflationary impacts and our own productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities and input materials, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp. Volatility in the market price of these commodities and input materials has a direct impact on our costs. Disruptions in our manufacturing, supply and distribution operations due to energy shortages, natural disasters, labor or freight constraints could also lead to increased costs. New or increased legal or regulatory requirements, along with initiatives to meet our sustainability goals, could also result in increased costs due to higher material costs and investments in facilities and equipment. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. Increased pricing in response to certain inflationary or cost increases may also offset portions of the cost impacts; however, such price increases may impact product consumption. If we are unable to manage cost impacts through pricing actions and consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. Foreign Exchange. We have significant translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates. Translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation of transaction-related working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. In the past three years, weakening of certain foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar has resulted in significant foreign exchange impacts leading to lower net sales, net earnings and cash flows. Certain countries that recently had and are currently experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations include Argentina, Brazil, Japan, Russia, Turkey and the United Kingdom. These fluctuations have significantly impacted our historical net sales, net earnings and cash flows and could do so in the future. Increased pricing in response to certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could also have a negative impact on the consumption of our products, which would negatively affect our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. Government Policies. Our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government legislative, regulatory or enforcement policies. For example, our net earnings and cash flows could be affected by any future legislative or regulatory changes in U.S. or non-U.S. tax policy, including changes resulting from the current work being led by the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework focused on ""Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy."" The breadth of the OECD project extends beyond pure digital businesses and, as proposed, is likely to impact most large multinational businesses by both redefining jurisdictional taxation rights and establishing a 15% global minimum tax. Our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows may also be impacted by changes in U.S. and foreign government policies related to environmental and climate change matters. Additionally, we attempt to carefully manage our debt, currency and other exposures in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and pricing controls, such as Argentina, Egypt and Pakistan. Further, our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes to international trade agreements in North America and elsewhere. Changes in government policies in the above areas might cause an increase or decrease in our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. Russia-Ukraine War. The war between Russia and Ukraine has negatively impacted our operations. Our Ukraine business includes two manufacturing sites and accounted for less than 1% of consolidated net sales and consolidated net earnings in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. Net assets of our Ukraine business accounted for less than 1% of consolidated net assets as of September 30, 2023. Our Russia business includes two manufacturing sites. Beginning in March 2022, the Company reduced its product portfolio, discontinued new capital investments and suspended media, advertising and promotional activity in Russia. The Russia business accounted for approximately 2% of consolidated net sales and consolidated net earnings in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. Net assets of our Russia business accounted for less than 2% of consolidated net assets as of September 30, 2023. Future impacts to the Company are difficult to predict due to the high level of uncertainty related to the war’s duration, evolution and ultimate resolution. Within Ukraine, there is a possibility of physical damage and destruction of our two manufacturing facilities. We may not be able to operate our manufacturing sites and source raw materials from our suppliers or ship finished products to our customers. Within Russia, we may not be able to continue our reduced operations at current levels due to sanctions and counter-sanctions, monetary, currency or payment controls, legislative restrictions or policies, restrictions on access to financial institutions and supply and transportation challenges. Our suppliers, distributors and retail customers are also impacted by the war and their ability to successfully maintain their operations could also impact our operations or negatively impact the sales of our products. More broadly, there could be additional negative impacts to our net sales, earnings and cash flows should the situation escalate beyond its current scope, including, among other potential impacts, economic recessions in certain neighboring countries or globally due to inflationary pressures and supply chain cost increases or the geographic proximity of the war relative to the rest of Europe. For additional information on risk factors that could impact our business results, please refer to Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2023. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 The following discussion provides a review of results for the three months ended September 30, 2023, versus the three months ended September 30, 2022. Three Months Ended September 30 Amounts in millions, except per share amounts 2023 2022 % Chg Net sales $ 21,871 $ 20,612 6% Operating income 5,767 4,939 17% Earnings before income taxes 5,802 4,997 16% Net earnings 4,556 3,963 15% Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 4,521 3,939 15% Diluted net earnings per common share 1.83 1.57 17% Three Months Ended September 30 COMPARISONS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES 2023 2022 Basis Pt Chg Gross margin 52.0 % 47.4 % 460 Selling, general & administrative expense 25.6 % 23.4 % 220 Operating income 26.4 % 24.0 % 240 Earnings before income taxes 26.5 % 24.2 % 230 Net earnings 20.8 % 19.2 % 160 Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 20.7 % 19.1 % 160 Net Sales Net sales for the quarter increased 6% to $21.9 billion. The increase in net sales was due to higher pricing of 7% and favorable mix of 1%, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange of 1% and a decrease in unit volume of 1%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, organic sales increased 7%. Favorable mix was primarily driven by volume growth in North America, which has higher than Company-average selling prices. The following table summarizes key drivers of the change in net sales by reportable segment: Net Sales Change Drivers 2023 vs. 2022 (Three Months Ended September 30) (1) Volume with Acquisitions & Divestitures Volume Excluding Acquisitions & Divestitures Foreign Exchange Price Mix Other (2) Net Sales Growth Beauty — % — % (3) % 7 % (2) % 1 % 3 % Grooming (2) % (2) % (3) % 9 % 1 % 1 % 6 % Health Care 2 % 2 % 1 % 6 % 2 % — % 11 % Fabric & Home Care (1) % — % (1) % 8 % 1 % 1 % 8 % Baby, Feminine & Family Care (3) % (3) % (2) % 8 % 2 % — % 5 % Total Company (1) % (1) % (1) % 7 % 1 % — % 6 % (1) Net sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied. (2) Other includes the sales mix impact from acquisitions and divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile volume to net sales. Operating Costs Gross margin increased 460 basis points to 52.0% of net sales for the quarter. The increase in gross margin was due to: • a 330 basis-point increase due to higher pricing, • 160 basis points of lower commodity costs and • 150 basis points of manufacturing productivity savings. These impacts were partially offset by • a 60 basis-point decline from unfavorable product mix including the disproportionate decline of the super-premium SK-II brand, • a 60 basis-point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, • 30 basis points of product and packaging investments and • a 30 basis-point decline from other manufacturing costs. Total SG&A spending increased 16% to $5.6 billion versus the prior year period due to increased marketing spending, overhead costs and other operating costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased 220 basis points to 25.6% due to the increase in marketing spending, overhead spending and other operating costs as a percentage of sales. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales increased 130 basis points as the increase in marketing spending was partially offset by the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and productivity savings. Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales increased 40 basis points due to wage inflation and other cost increases, partially offset by the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and productivity savings. Other operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 50 basis points due to higher foreign exchange transactional charges. Productivity-driven cost savings delivered 60 basis points of benefit to SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Non-Operating Expenses and Income Interest expense was $225 million for the quarter, an increase of $102 million versus the prior year period due primarily to higher interest rates. Interest income was $128 million for the quarter, an increase of $86 million versus the prior year period due primarily to higher interest rates. Other non-operating income was $132 million, which is a decrease of $7 million versus the prior year period. Income Taxes The effective income tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2023, was 21.5%, compared to 20.7% for the three months ended September 30, 2022. The increase in the effective tax rate was driven by unfavorable impacts from the geographic mix of current period earnings. This increase was partially offset by higher excess tax benefits of share-based compensation. Net Earnings Operating income increased $828 million, or 17%, to $5.8 billion for the quarter, due to the increase in net sales and the increase in operating margin, the components of which are described above. Net earnings increased $593 million, or 15%, to $4.6 billion, as the increase in operating income was partially offset by an increase in the effective tax rate. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of approximately $170 million on net earnings for the quarter, including both transactional and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars. Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $582 million, or 15%, to $4.5 billion for the quarter. Diluted EPS increased 17% to $1.83 versus the prior year period due to the increase in net earnings and a reduction in the weighted average number of shares outstanding. The Procter & Gamble Company 12 SEGMENT RESULTS – Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 The following discussion provides a review of results by reportable business segment. Analysis of the results for the three month period ended September 30, 2023, is provided based on a comparison to the three month period ended September 30, 2022. The primary financial measures used to evaluate segment performance are net sales and net earnings. The table below provides supplemental information on net sales, earnings before income taxes and net earnings by reportable business segment for the three months ended September 30, 2023, versus the comparable prior year period (dollar amounts in millions): Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Net Sales % Change Versus Year Ago Earnings/(Loss) Before Income Taxes % Change Versus Year Ago Net Earnings/(Loss) % Change Versus Year Ago Beauty $ 4,097 3 % $ 1,249 (2) % $ 971 (4) % Grooming 1,724 6 % 533 6 % 421 4 % Health Care 3,074 11 % 889 11 % 689 12 % Fabric & Home Care 7,646 8 % 2,031 32 % 1,569 34 % Baby, Feminine & Family Care 5,186 5 % 1,408 33 % 1,075 34 % Corporate 144 N/A (308) N/A (168) N/A Total Company $ 21,871 6 % $ 5,802 16 % $ 4,556 15 % Beauty Three months ended September 30, 2023, compared with three months ended September 30, 2022 Beauty net sales increased 3% to $4.1 billion as the positive impacts of higher pricing of 7% and a benefit from acquisitions of 1% were partially offset by the negative impacts of unfavorable foreign exchange of 3% and unfavorable mix of 2% (due primarily to the decline of the super-premium SK-II brand, which has higher than segment-average selling prices). Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, organic sales increased 5%. Global market share of the Beauty segment increased 0.3 points. • Hair Care net sales increased high single digits. Positive impacts of higher pricing (driven by North America, Latin America and Europe), a benefit from acquisitions and favorable product mix (due to the growth of premium products) were partially offset by negative impacts of unfavorable foreign exchange and a decline in unit volume. The volume decrease was driven by a decline in Greater China (due to market contraction and distribution footprint changes), partially offset by growth in Latin America and Europe (both due to market growth). Organic sales increased high single digits driven by a more than 30% growth in Latin America, a mid-teens increase in Europe and a double-digit increase in North America, partially offset by a high single-digit decline in Greater China. Global market share of the Hair Care category decreased 0.2 points. • Skin and Personal Care net sales were unchanged. Positive impacts of higher pricing (across all regions) and a unit volume increase were offset by the negative impacts of unfavorable mix (due to the decline of the super-premium SK-II brand, which has higher than category-average selling prices) and unfavorable foreign exchange. The volume increase was driven by growth in North America and Europe (both due to innovation in Personal Care), partially offset by a decline in Asia Pacific and Greater China, both due to the decline of the super-premium SK-II brand. Organic sales increased low single digits as a double-digit increase in North America was partially offset by a more than 20% decline in Asia Pacific and a mid-single-digit decline in Greater China. Global market share of the Skin and Personal Care category increased 0.6 points. Net earnings decreased 4% to $971 million as the increase in net sales was more than offset by a 180 basis-point decline in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin decreased as an increase in gross margin was more than fully offset by an increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales and a higher effective tax rate. The gross margin improvement was driven by increased pricing and productivity savings, partially offset by negative product mix (due to the decline of the super-premium SK-II brand) and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased due primarily to an increase in marketing spending and higher foreign exchange transactional charges, partially offset by the positive scale effects of the net sales increase. The higher effective tax rate was driven by unfavorable geographic mix. Grooming Three months ended September 30, 2023, compared with three months ended September 30, 2022 Grooming net sales increased 6% to $1.7 billion as the benefits of higher pricing of 9% (driven by all regions) and favorable product mix of 1% (due to growth of appliances) were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange of 3% and a decrease in unit volume of 2%. The volume decline was driven by Europe (due to increased pricing), partially offset by growth in IMEA and Latin America (both due to innovation). Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, Grooming organic sales increased 9% driven by growth across all regions led by a more than 30% growth in Latin America and a double-digit growth in Europe. Global market share of the Grooming segment increased 0.3 points. 13 The Procter & Gamble Company Net earnings increased 4% to $421 million as the net sales growth was partially offset by a 40 basis-point decrease in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin decreased as an increase in gross margin was more than fully offset by an increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. The gross margin increase was driven by higher pricing, partially offset by negative gross margin product mix (due to the growth of appliances, which have lower than segment-average gross margins) and unfavorable foreign exchange. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased due primarily to an increase in marketing spending and higher foreign exchange transactional charges, partially offset by the positive scale effects of the net sales increase. Health Care Three months ended September 30, 2023, compared with three months ended September 30, 2022 Health Care net sales increased 11% to $3.1 billion driven by higher pricing of 6%, favorable product mix of 2%, an increase in unit volume of 2% and favorable foreign exchange of 1%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, organic sales increased 10%. Global market share of the Health Care segment increased 1 point. • Oral Care net sales increased high single digits driven by the positive impacts of higher pricing (driven by Europe, North America and Latin America), favorable product mix (due to growth in power brushes, which have higher than category-average selling prices) and favorable foreign exchange. Unit volume was unchanged, as a decline in Greater China (due to market contraction) was offset by growth in North America (due to market growth). Organic sales increased high single digits driven by a mid-teens increase in Europe and a mid-single-digit increase in North America. Global market share of the Oral Care category increased 0.2 points. • Personal Health Care net sales increased low teens due to the positive impacts of higher pricing (driven by North America, Europe and Latin America), a unit volume increase and favorable foreign exchange. The volume increase was driven by growth in North America (due to innovation and increased demand for respiratory products) and Europe (due to increased demand for respiratory products), partially offset by a decline in Asia Pacific (due to market contraction). Organic sales increased double digits driven by a more than 20% growth in Europe and a low teens growth in North America. Global market share of the Personal Health Care category increased 1.1 points. Net earnings increased 12% to $689 million due to the increase in net sales. Net earnings margin was unchanged as an increase in gross margin was offset by an increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. The gross margin increase was driven by higher pricing, partially offset by unfavorable gross margin product mix (due to a decline in whitening products, which have higher than segment-average gross margins). SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased due to increased marketing spending, partially offset by the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase. Fabric & Home Care Three months ended September 30, 2023, compared with three months ended September 30, 2022 Fabric & Home Care net sales increased 8% to $7.6 billion driven by higher pricing of 8% and favorable product mix of 1%, partially offset by a decrease in unit volume of 1% and unfavorable foreign exchange of 1%. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange and acquisitions and divestitures, organic sales increased 9%. Global market share of the Fabric & Home Care segment increased 0.2 points. • Fabric Care net sales increased mid-single digits. The positive impacts of higher pricing (driven by Europe, IMEA and Latin America) and favorable premium product mix were partially offset by a decrease in unit volume and unfavorable foreign exchange. The volume decrease was primarily driven by declines in Greater China (due to market contraction and portfolio rationalization) and Asia Pacific (due to increased pricing), partially offset by growth in North America (due to market growth) and Europe. Organic sales increased high single digits driven by a more than 20% increase in Europe, a mid-teens increase in IMEA and a low single-digit increase in North America. Global market share of the Fabric Care category decreased 0.3 points. • Home Care net sales increased double digits.

Organic sales increased low teens driven by a 20% growth in Europe and double-digit growth in North America. Global market share of the Home Care category increased 1.1 points. Net earnings increased 34% to $1.6 billion due to the increase in net sales and a 400 basis-point improvement in net earnings margin.

The gross margin increase was driven by higher pricing, lower commodity costs and increased productivity savings, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased due to an increase in marketing spending, partially offset by the positive scale effects of the net sales increase. Baby, Feminine & Family Care Three months ended September 30, 2023, compared with three months ended September 30, 2022 Baby, Feminine & Family Care net sales increased 5% to $5.2 billion driven by higher pricing of 8% and favorable product mix of 2%, partially offset by a decrease in unit volume of 3% and unfavorable foreign exchange of 2%.

Organic sales increased mid-single digits driven by growth in all regions led by a 30% growth in Latin America and a mid-teens growth in IMEA. Global market share of the Baby Care category decreased 0.4 points. • Feminine Care net sales increased mid-single digits. Positive impacts of higher pricing (driven primarily by Europe and IMEA) and favorable mix (due to growth of premium products) were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange and a decrease in unit volume.

Net earnings increased 34% to $1.1 billion due to the increase in net sales and a 440 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin increased primarily due to an increase in gross margin, partially offset by an increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin increased primarily due to increased pricing, lower commodity costs and increased productivity savings, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased due to an increase in marketing spending and higher foreign exchange transactional charges, partially offset by the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase. Corporate Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business segments. These include but are not limited to incidental businesses managed at the corporate level, gains and losses related to certain divested brands or businesses, impacts from various financing and investing activities, impacts related to employee benefits, asset impairments and restructuring activities including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used within the reportable segments to U.S. GAAP. The most notable ongoing reconciling item is income taxes, which adjusts the blended statutory rates that are reflected in the reportable segments to the overall Company effective tax rate. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, Corporate net sales decreased $109 million to $144 million due to a decrease in net sales of incidental businesses managed at the corporate level. Corporate net earnings decreased $122 million to a loss of $168 million for the quarter primarily due to higher restructuring charges and higher interest expense net of interest income. LIQUIDITY & CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating Activities Operating cash flow was $4.9 billion fiscal year to date, an increase of $834 million versus the prior year period. Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, deferred income taxes and gain on sale of assets), generated $5.5 billion of operating cash flow. Working capital and other impacts used $578 million of cash in the period primarily driven by increases in accounts receivable from sales growth and the payment of prior fiscal year-end incentive compensation accruals. This is partially offset by the impact of our supplier finance program (see Note 10, Supplier Finance Programs) and current year tax accruals in excess of payments. Days sales outstanding increased by two days. Days on hand increased by two days. Investing Activities Investing activities used $1.2 billion of cash fiscal year to date primarily driven by capital expenditures and the settlement of net investment hedges. Financing Activities Financing activities consumed $2.0 billion of net cash fiscal year to date, mainly due to dividends to shareholders and treasury stock purchases, partially offset by a net debt increase and the impact of stock options and other. As of September 30, 2023, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $12.2 billion. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements. 15 The Procter & Gamble Company MEASURES NOT DEFINED BY U.S. GAAP In accordance with the SEC's Regulation S-K Item 10(e), the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measure. We believe that these measures provide useful perspective on underlying business trends (i.e., trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and results and provide a supplemental measure of period-to-period results. The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors, as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measures but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted. Organic sales growth: Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. This measure is used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of organic sales growth to reported net sales growth: Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Net Sales Growth Foreign Exchange Impact Acquisition & Divestiture Impact/Other (1) Organic Sales Growth Beauty 3 % 3 % (1) % 5 % Grooming 6 % 3 % — % 9 % Health Care 11 % (1) % — % 10 % Fabric & Home Care 8 % 1 % — % 9 % Baby, Feminine & Family Care 5 % 2 % — % 7 % Total Company 6 % 1 % — % 7 % (1) Acquisition & Divestiture Impact/Other includes the volume and mix impact of acquisitions and divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile net sales to organic sales. Adjusted free cash flow: Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the U.S. Tax Act. Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow ($ millions): Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Operating Cash Flow Capital Spending U.S. Tax Act Payments Adjusted Free Cash Flow $ 4,904 $ ( 925 ) $ 422 $ 4,401 Adjusted free cash flow productivity: Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings. We view adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G’s ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, in allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. This measure is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. The following table provides a numerical reconciliation of adjusted free cash flow productivity ($ millions): Three Months Ended September 30, 2023 Adjusted Free Cash Flow Net Earnings Adjusted Free Cash Flow Productivity $ 4,401 $ 4,556 97 % Core EPS: Core EPS is a measure of the Company's diluted EPS excluding items that are not judged by management to be part of the Company's sustainable results or trends. Management views this non-GAAP measure as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time. This measure is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. For the three months ended September 30, 2023, and September 30, 2022, there were no adjustments to or reconciling items for diluted EPS. The Procter & Gamble Company 16 Item 3.

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Basis of Presentation These statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of The Procter & Gamble Company and subsidiaries (the ""Company,"" ""Procter & Gamble,"" ""P&G,"" ""we"" or ""our"") contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods reported. However, the results of operations included in such financial statements may not necessarily be indicative of annual results. 2. New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies In November 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2021-10, ""Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance"". This guidance requires annual disclosures for transactions with a government authority that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution model. These amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted. We have completed our evaluation of significant transactions. The guidance has not had, and is not expected to have, a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, ""Liabilities - Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations"". This guidance requires annual and interim disclosures for entities that use supplier finance programs in connection with the purchase of goods and services. These amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, except for the amendment on rollforward information, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. We are currently assessing the impact of this guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements. No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had, or is expected to have, a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 3.

The following is a summary of reportable segment results: Three Months Ended March 31 Nine Months Ended March 31 Net Sales Earnings/(Loss) Before Income Taxes Net Earnings/(Loss) Net Sales Earnings/(Loss) Before Income Taxes Net Earnings/(Loss) Beauty 2023 $ 3,494 $ 763 $ 608 $ 11,262 $ 3,179 $ 2,530 2022 3,389 792 644 11,279 3,213 2,582 Grooming 2023 1,495 382 308 4,763 1,381 1,116 2022 1,481 353 290 4,979 1,447 1,183 Health Care 2023 2,828 667 523 8,636 2,354 1,826 2022 2,662 625 485 8,314 2,225 1,715 Fabric & Home Care 2023 7,016 1,538 1,174 21,130 4,619 3,517 2022 6,699 1,275 969 20,680 4,284 3,297 Baby, Feminine & Family Care 2023 5,062 1,206 925 15,061 3,373 2,578 2022 4,935 1,091 836 14,915 3,353 2,576 Corporate 2023 173 ( 268 ) ( 114 ) 601 ( 786 ) ( 221 ) 2022 215 ( 65 ) 143 505 ( 177 ) 382 Total Company 2023 $ 20,068 $ 4,288 $ 3,424 $ 61,453 $ 14,120 $ 11,346 2022 19,381 4,071 3,367 60,672 14,345 11,735 Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. 4. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill is allocated by reportable segment as follows: Beauty Grooming Health Care Fabric & Home Care Baby, Feminine & Family Care Total Company Goodwill at June 30, 2022 $ 13,296 $ 12,571 $ 7,589 $ 1,808 $ 4,436 $ 39,700 Acquisitions and divestitures 404 — — — 34 438 Translation and other 221 148 130 16 65 580 Goodwill at March 31, 2023 $ 13,921 $ 12,719 $ 7,719 $ 1,824 $ 4,535 $ 40,718 Goodwill increased from June 30, 2022, primarily due to an acquisition in the Beauty segment, other minor brand acquisitions in the Baby, Feminine & Family Care segment and currency translation. Identifiable intangible assets at March 31, 2023, were comprised of: Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Intangible assets with determinable lives $ 9,170 $ ( 6,335 ) Intangible assets with indefinite lives 20,997 — Total identifiable intangible assets $ 30,167 $ ( 6,335 ) Intangible assets with determinable lives consist of brands, patents, technology and customer relationships. The intangible assets with indefinite lives primarily consist of brands. The amortization expense of determinable-lived intangible assets for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, was $ 82 and $ 79 , respectively. For the nine months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, amortization expense was $ 241 and $ 230 , respectively. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment. We use the income method to estimate the fair value of these assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. If the resulting fair value is less than the asset's carrying value, that difference represents an impairment. Our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets occurs during the three months ended December 31. Most of our goodwill reporting units have fair value cushions that significantly exceed their underlying carrying values. In connection with the Grooming operating segment integration as described further in Note 3, we concluded that the Shave Care and Appliances categories are one reporting unit (Grooming) for goodwill impairment testing. Based on our annual impairment testing performed during the three months ended December 31, 2022, our Grooming goodwill reporting unit, which is comprised entirely of acquired businesses, has a fair value cushion of over 30 % and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset's fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 5 %. While we have concluded that no triggering event has occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2023, the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is most susceptible to future impairment risk. As of March 31, 2023, the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset was $ 14.1 billion. Adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment, including foreign currency devaluation, increasing global inflation, market contraction from an economic recession and the Russia-Ukraine War, could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset and trigger a future impairment charge. Further reduction of the Gillette business activities in Russia could reduce the estimated fair value by up to 5%. The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the net sales growth rates (including residual growth rates), discount rate and royalty rates. Net sales growth rates could be negatively impacted by reductions or changes in demand for our Gillette products, which may be caused by, among other things: changes in the use and frequency of grooming products, shifts in demand away from one or more of our higher priced products to lower priced products or potential supply chain constraints. In addition, relative global and country/regional macroeconomic factors, including the Russia-Ukraine War, could result in additional and prolonged devaluation of other countries' currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The residual growth rates represent the expected rate at which the Gillette brand is expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period. The residual growth rates utilized in our fair value estimates are consistent with the brand operating plans and approximate expected long-term category market growth rates. The residual growth rate depends on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, relative currency exchange rates and business activities that impact market share. As a result, the residual growth rate could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes, devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or an increased competitive environment. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. The discount rate, which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, such as further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar. Spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the U.S. The royalty rate used to determine the estimated fair value for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is driven by historical and estimated future profitability of the underlying Gillette business. The royalty rate may be impacted by significant adverse changes in long-term operating margins. We performed a sensitivity analysis for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset as part of our annual impairment testing during the three months ended December 31, 2022, utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the discount rate, the short-term and residual growth rates and the royalty rates to demonstrate the potential impacts to estimated fair values. The table below provides, in isolation, the estimated fair value impacts related to a 25 basis-point increase in the discount rate, a 25 basis-point decrease in our short-term and residual growth rates or a 50 basis-point decrease in our royalty rates, which may result in an impairment of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset. Approximate Percent Change in Estimated Fair Value +25 bps Discount Rate -25 bps Growth Rates -50 bps Royalty Rate Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset ( 6 )% ( 6 )% ( 4 )% 5. Earnings Per Share Basic net earnings per common share are calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble less preferred dividends by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net earnings per common share are calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble by the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The diluted shares include the dilutive effect of stock options and other stock-based awards based on the treasury stock method and the assumed conversion of preferred stock. Net earnings per share were calculated as follows: CONSOLIDATED AMOUNTS Three Months Ended March 31 Nine Months Ended March 31 2023 2022 2023 2022 Net earnings $ 3,424 $ 3,367 $ 11,346 $ 11,735 Less: Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 27 12 77 45 Net earnings attributable to P&G (Diluted) 3,397 3,355 11,269 11,690 Less: Preferred dividends 69 68 210 208 Net earnings attributable to P&G available to common shareholders (Basic) $ 3,328 $ 3,287 $ 11,059 $ 11,482 SHARES IN MILLIONS Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 2,359.1 2,400.5 2,370.2 2,414.0 Add: Effect of dilutive securities Convertible preferred shares (1) 76.0 78.9 76.7 79.7 Stock options and other unvested equity awards (2) 38.1 50.8 39.1 50.7 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 2,473.2 2,530.2 2,486.0 2,544.4 NET EARNINGS PER SHARE (3) Basic $ 1.41 $ 1.37 $ 4.67 $ 4.76 Diluted $ 1.37 $ 1.33 $ 4.53 $ 4.59 (1) An overview of preferred shares can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. (2) Excludes 21 million and 5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, and 20 million and 11 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, of weighted average stock options outstanding because the exercise price of these options was greater than their average market value or their effect was antidilutive. (3) Net earnings per share are calculated on Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. 6. Share-Based Compensation and Postretirement Benefits The following table provides a summary of our share-based compensation expense and postretirement benefit impacts: Three Months Ended March 31 Nine Months Ended March 31 2023 2022 2023 2022 Share-based compensation expense $ 156 $ 130 $ 406 $ 398 Net periodic benefit cost for pension benefits 45 47 132 143 Net periodic benefit credit for other retiree benefits ( 131 ) ( 126 ) ( 395 ) ( 348 ) 7. Risk Management Activities and Fair Value Measurements As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. There have been no significant changes in our risk management policies or activities during the nine months ended March 31, 2023. The Company has not changed its valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period. The Company recognizes transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of each quarter. There were no transfers between levels during the periods presented. Also, there was no significant activity within the Level 3 assets and liabilities during the periods presented. There were no significant assets or liabilities that were remeasured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the periods presented. Cash equivalents were $ 6.0 billion as of March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, and are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. Other investments had a fair value of $ 91 and $ 140 as of March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, respectively, including equity securities of $ 63 and $ 113 as of March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, respectively, and are presented in Other noncurrent assets. Investments measured at fair value are primarily classified as Level 1 and Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Level 1 are based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 are based on quoted market prices for similar instruments. There are no material investment balances classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy or using net asset value as a practical expedient. Unrealized gains/(losses) on equity securities were $ 2 and $( 4 ) during the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Unrealized gains/(losses) on equity securities were $ 10 and $( 36 ) during the nine months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. These unrealized gains/(losses) are recognized in Other non-operating income, net. The fair value of long-term debt was $ 25.9 billion and $ 25.7 billion as of March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, respectively. This includes the current portion of long-term debt instruments ($ 4.1 billion and $ 3.6 billion as of March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, respectively). Certain long-term debt (debt designated as a fair value hedge) is recorded at fair value. All other long-term debt is recorded at amortized cost but is measured at fair value for disclosure purposes. We consider our debt to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Fair values are generally estimated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments. Disclosures about Financial Instruments The notional amounts and fair values of financial instruments used in hedging transactions as of March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, are as follows: Notional Amount Fair Value Asset Fair Value (Liability) March 31, 2023 June 30, 2022 March 31, 2023 June 30, 2022 March 31, 2023 June 30, 2022 DERIVATIVES IN FAIR VALUE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Interest rate contracts $ 4,054 $ 4,972 $ — $ 3 $ ( 445 ) $ ( 307 ) DERIVATIVES IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Foreign currency interest rate contracts $ 10,349 $ 7,943 $ 4 $ 561 $ ( 685 ) $ ( 1 ) TOTAL DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS $ 14,403 $ 12,915 $ 4 $ 564 $ ( 1,130 ) $ ( 308 ) DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS Foreign currency contracts $ 5,698 $ 5,625 $ 39 $ 6 $ ( 18 ) $ ( 61 ) TOTAL DERIVATIVES AT FAIR VALUE $ 20,101 $ 18,540 $ 43 $ 570 $ ( 1,148 ) $ ( 369 ) Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. The fair value of the interest rate derivative asset/(liability) directly offsets the cumulative amount of the fair value hedging adjustment included in the carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation. The carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation, which includes the unamortized discount or premium and the fair value adjustment, was $ 3.6 billion and $ 4.7 billion as of March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, respectively. In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges. The carrying value of those debt instruments designated as net investment hedges, which includes the adjustment for the foreign currency transaction gain or loss on those instruments, was $ 10.5 billion and $ 11.2 billion as of March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, respectively. The increase in the notional balance of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges is partially offset by the decrease in debt designated as a net investment hedge due to maturities. The net increase in the total amount of instruments designated as net investment hedges is primarily driven by the Company's decision to leverage favorable interest rate spreads in the foreign currency swap market. All derivative assets are presented in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Other noncurrent assets. All derivative liabilities are presented in Accrued and other liabilities or Other noncurrent liabilities. Changes in the fair value of net investment hedges are recognized in the Foreign currency translation component of Other comprehensive income (OCI). All of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Substantially all of the Company's financial instruments used in hedging transactions are governed by industry standard netting and collateral agreements with counterparties. If the Company's credit rating were to fall below the levels stipulated in the agreements, the counterparties could demand either collateralization or termination of the arrangements. The aggregate fair value of the instruments covered by these contractual features that are in a net liability position was $ 1,131 and $ 219 as of March 31, 2023 and June 30, 2022, respectively. The Company has not been required to post collateral as a result of these contractual features. Before tax gains on our financial instruments in hedging relationships are categorized as follows: Amount of Gain/(Loss) Recognized in OCI on Derivatives Three Months Ended March 31 Nine Months Ended March 31 2023 2022 2023 2022 DERIVATIVES IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS (1) (2) Foreign exchange contracts $ (266) $ 104 $ (571) $ 530 (1) For the derivatives in net investment hedging relationships, the amount of gain excluded from effectiveness testing, which was recognized in earnings, was $ 64 and $ 18 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The amount of gain excluded from effectiveness testing was $ 179 and $ 50 for the nine months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. (2) In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges. The amount of gain/(loss) recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) for such instruments was $( 242 ) and $ 237 for the three months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The amount of gain/(loss) recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) for such instruments was $( 406 ) and $ 804 for the nine months ended March 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Amount of Gain/(Loss) Recognized in Earnings Three Months Ended March 31 Nine Months Ended March 31 2023 2022 2023 2022 DERIVATIVES IN FAIR VALUE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Interest rate contracts $ 39 $ ( 216 ) $ ( 141 ) $ ( 313 ) DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS Foreign currency contracts $ 38 $ ( 2 ) $ ( 13 ) $ 28 The loss on the derivatives in fair value hedging relationships is fully offset by the mark-to-market impact of the related exposure. These are both recognized in Interest expense. The loss on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is substantially offset by the currency mark-to-market of the related exposure. These are both recognized in Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A). Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. 8. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss) The table below presents the changes in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) attributable to Procter & Gamble (AOCI), including the reclassifications out of AOCI by component: Investment Securities Postretirement Benefit Plans Foreign Currency Translation Total AOCI Balance at June 30, 2022 $ 20 $ 27 $ ( 12,236 ) $ ( 12,189 ) OCI before reclassifications (1) ( 2 ) ( 22 ) ( 74 ) ( 98 ) Amounts reclassified to the Consolidated Statement of Earnings (2) — 14 — 14 Net current period OCI ( 2 ) ( 8 ) ( 74 ) ( 84 ) Less: OCI attributable to noncontrolling interests — ( 7 ) ( 7 ) Balance at March 31, 2023 $ 18 $ 19 $ ( 12,303 ) $ ( 12,266 ) (1) Net of tax (benefit)/expense of $( 1 ), $( 13 ) and $( 230 ) for gains/losses on investment securities, postretirement benefit plans and foreign currency translation, respectively. Income tax effects within foreign currency translation include impacts from items such as net investment hedge transactions. (2) Net of tax (benefit)/expense of $ 0 , $ 7 and $ 0 for gains/losses on investment securities, postretirement benefit plans and foreign currency translation, respectively. Postretirement benefit plan amounts are reclassified from AOCI into Other non-operating income, net and included in the computation of net periodic postretirement costs. 9. Commitments and Contingencies Litigation We are subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental, patent and trademark matters, labor and employment matters and tax. While considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management and our counsel, the ultimate resolution of the various lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior manufacturing and waste disposal practices. Based on currently available information, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of environmental remediation will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Income Tax Uncertainties The Company is present in approximately 70 countries and over 150 taxable jurisdictions and, at any point in time, has 40 – 50 jurisdictional audits underway at various stages of completion. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite our belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitations. Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate. We have tax years open ranging from 2010 and forward. We are generally not able to reliably estimate the ultimate settlement amounts until the close of an audit. Based on information currently available, we anticipate that over the next 12-month period, audit activity could be completed related to uncertain tax positions in multiple jurisdictions for which we have accrued existing liabilities of approximately $ 30 , including interest and penalties. Additional information on the Commitments and Contingencies of the Company can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. Item 2.

Purpose, Approach and Non-GAAP Measures The purpose of Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is to provide an understanding of Procter & Gamble's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. The MD&A is organized into the following sections: • Overview • Summary of Results – Nine Months Ended March 31, 2023 • Economic Conditions and Uncertainties • Results of Operations – Three and Nine Months Ended March 31, 2023 • Business Segment Discussion – Three and Nine Months Ended March 31, 2023 • Liquidity and Capital Resources • Reconciliation of Measures Not Defined by U.S. GAAP Throughout the MD&A, we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales, net earnings, diluted net earnings per share and operating cash flow. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) that include organic sales growth, core earnings per share (Core EPS), adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity. The explanation at the end of the MD&A provides the definition of these non-GAAP measures, details on the use and the derivation of these measures, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition, despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and market consumption in the MD&A are based on a combination of vendor purchased traditional brick-and-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales of our products in dollar terms on a constant currency basis relative to all product sales in the category. The Company measures fiscal year to date market shares through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months as compared to the end of the reporting period. Management also uses unit volume growth to evaluate and explain drivers of changes in net sales. Organic volume growth reflects year-over-year changes in unit volume excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and certain one-time items, if applicable, and is used to explain changes in organic sales. OVERVIEW P&G is a global leader in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world. Our products are sold in approximately 180 countries and territories, primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores and professional channels. We also sell direct to individual consumers. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries. Our market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products).

The following table provides the percentage of net sales and net earnings by reportable business segment (excluding Corporate) for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2023: Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 Nine Months Ended March 31, 2023 Net Sales Net Earnings Net Sales Net Earnings Beauty 18% 17% 19% 22% Grooming 8% 9% 8% 10% Health Care 14% 15% 14% 16% Fabric & Home Care 35% 33% 35% 30% Baby, Feminine & Family Care 25% 26% 24% 22% Total Company 100% 100% 100% 100% SUMMARY OF RESULTS The following are highlights of results for the nine months ended March 31, 2023, versus the nine months ended March 31, 2022: • Net sales increased by 1% to $61.5 billion versus the prior year period. Net sales increased mid-single digits in Health Care, low single digits in Fabric & Home Care and Baby, Feminine & Family Care and decreased mid-single digits in Grooming. Net Sales in Beauty was unchanged. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, increased 7%. Organic sales increased high single digits in Health Care and Fabric & Home Care and mid-single digits in Baby, Feminine & Family Care, Grooming and Beauty. • Net earnings were $11.3 billion, a decrease of $389 million, or 3%, versus the prior year period due to a decrease in operating margin, partially offset by the increase in net sales. • Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble were $11.3 billion, a decrease of $421 million, or 4%, versus the prior year period. • Diluted net earnings per share (EPS) decreased 1% to $4.53 due to the decrease in net earnings, partially offset by a reduction in the weighted average shares outstanding. • Operating cash flow was $11.5 billion. Adjusted free cash flow, which is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and transitional tax payments resulting from the U.S. Tax Act, was $9.4 billion. Adjusted free cash flow productivity, which is defined as adjusted free cash flow as a percentage of net earnings, was 83%. ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTI ES Global Economic Conditions. Our products are sold in numerous countries across North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa, with more than half our sales generated outside the United States. As such, we are exposed to and impacted by global macroeconomic factors, U.S. and foreign government policies and foreign exchange fluctuations. Current macroeconomic factors remain very dynamic, and any causes of market size contraction, such as greater political unrest or instability in Central and Eastern Europe (including the ongoing Russia-Ukraine War), the Middle East, certain Latin American markets and the Korean peninsula could reduce our sales or erode our operating margin and consequently reduce our net earnings and cash flows. Changes in Costs. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity and input material prices, transportation and labor costs, broader inflationary impacts and our own productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities and input materials, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp. Volatility in the market price of these commodities and input materials has a direct impact on our costs. Disruptions in our manufacturing, supply and distribution operations, energy shortages, port congestions, labor constraints, freight container and truck shortages and inflation have impacted our costs and could do so in the future. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. Increased pricing in response to certain inflationary impacts or cost increases may also offset portions of the impacts, however such increases may impact product consumption. If we are unable to manage these impacts through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions, as well as through consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. Foreign Exchange. We have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates. Translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation of transaction-related working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. Historically, weakening of certain foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar have resulted in significant foreign exchange impacts leading to lower net sales, net earnings and cash flows. Certain countries experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations such as Argentina, Brazil, United Kingdom, Japan, Russia and Turkey have had, and could continue to have, a significant impact on our net sales, net earnings and cash flows. Increased pricing in response to certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could also have a negative impact on the consumption of our products, which would negatively affect our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. Government Policies. Our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government legislative, regulatory or enforcement policies. Our net earnings and cash flows could be affected by any future legislative or regulatory changes in U.S. or non-U.S. tax policy, including changes resulting from the current work being led by the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework focused on ""Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy"". Our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows may also be impacted by changes in U.S. and foreign government policies related to environmental and climate change matters. Additionally, we attempt to carefully manage our debt, currency and other exposures in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and pricing controls, such as Argentina, Egypt and Pakistan. Our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes to international trade agreements in North America and elsewhere. Changes in government policies in the above areas might cause an increase or decrease in our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. Russia-Ukraine War. The war between Russia and Ukraine has negatively impacted our operations in both countries. Our Ukraine business includes two manufacturing sites. We have approximately 400 employees including both manufacturing and non-manufacturing personnel. Our operations in Ukraine accounted for less than 1% of consolidated net sales and net earnings in fiscal 2022. Additionally, net assets of our Ukraine subsidiary, along with Ukraine related assets held by other subsidiaries, account for less than 1% of net assets as of March 31, 2023. Our Russia business includes two manufacturing sites with a net book value of approximately $200 million as of March 31, 2023. We have approximately 1,800 employees, including both manufacturing and non-manufacturing personnel. In fiscal 2022, our operations in Russia accounted for less than 2% of consolidated net sales and less than 1% of net earnings. Additionally, net assets of our Russia subsidiaries, along with Russia related assets held by other subsidiaries, account for less than 2% of net assets as of March 31, 2023. Beginning in March 2022, the Company reduced its product portfolio, discontinued new capital investments and suspended media, advertising and promotional activity in Russia. Future impacts to the Company are difficult to predict due to the high level of uncertainty related to the war’s duration, evolution and resolution. Within Ukraine, there is a possibility of physical damage and destruction of our two manufacturing facilities. We may not be able to operate our manufacturing sites and source raw materials from our suppliers or ship finished products to our customers. Ultimately, these could result in impairments of our manufacturing plants and fixed assets or write-downs of other operating assets and working capital. Within Russia, we may not be able to continue our reduced operations at current levels due to sanctions and counter-sanctions, monetary, currency or payment controls, legislative restrictions or policies, restrictions on access to financial institutions and supply and transportation challenges. Our suppliers, distributors and retail customers are also impacted by the war and their ability to successfully maintain their operations could also impact our operations or negatively impact the sales of our products. More broadly, there could be additional negative impacts to our net sales, earnings and cash flows should the situation escalate beyond its current scope, including, among other potential impacts, economic recessions in certain neighboring countries or globally due to inflationary pressures and supply chain cost increases or the geographic proximity of the war relative to the rest of Europe. For a more complete discussion of the risks we encounter in our business, please refer to Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 The following discussion provides a review of results for the three months ended March 31, 2023, versus the three months ended March 31, 2022. Three Months Ended March 31 Amounts in millions, except per share amounts 2023 2022 % Chg Net sales $20,068 $19,381 4% Operating income 4,248 4,024 6% Net earnings 3,424 3,367 2% Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 3,397 3,355 1% Diluted net earnings per common share 1.37 1.33 3% Three Months Ended March 31 COMPARISONS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES 2023 2022 Basis Pt Chg Gross margin 48.2% 46.7% 150 Selling, general & administrative expense 27.0% 26.0% 100 Operating income 21.2% 20.8% 40 Earnings before income taxes 21.4% 21.0% 40 Net earnings 17.1% 17.4% (30) Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 16.9% 17.3% (40) Net Sales Net sales for the quarter increased by 4% to $20.1 billion. The increase in net sales was due to higher pricing of 10% and favorable mix of 1%, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange of 4% and a decrease in unit volume of 3%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, organic sales increased 7%. Favorable mix was driven by a higher proportion of sales in North America (with higher than company-average selling prices) and a lower proportion of sales in Europe (with lower than company-average selling prices). Net Sales increased mid-single digits in Health Care and Fabric & Home Care and increased low single digits in Beauty, Baby, Feminine & Family Care and Grooming. On a regional basis, volume decreased double digits in Europe, decreased mid-single digits in Asia Pacific and IMEA, decreased low single digits in Greater China and increased mid-single digits in Latin America. Volume was unchanged in North America.

(2) Other includes the sales mix impact from acquisitions and divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile volume to net sales. Operating Costs Gross margin increased 150 basis points to 48.2% of net sales for the quarter. The increase in gross margin was due to: • a 470 basis-point increase due to higher pricing and • 210 basis points of manufacturing productivity savings. These impacts were partially offset by • 270 basis points of increased commodity and input material costs, • a 140 basis-point decline from unfavorable product mix including the disproportionate decline of the super-premium SK-II brand, • a 70 basis-point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, • 20 basis points of increased transportation costs, • 20 basis points of product and packaging investments and • a 10 basis-point decline from capacity start-up and other manufacturing costs. Total SG&A spending increased by 8% to $5.4 billion versus the prior year period due to increased marketing spending, overhead costs and other operating costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased 100 basis points to 27.0% due primarily to the increase in overhead costs and other operating costs as a percentage of sales. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 10 basis points as the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and productivity savings were mostly offset by the increase in marketing spending. Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales increased 50 basis points due to wage inflation and other cost increases, partially offset by productivity savings and the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase. Other operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 60 basis points due primarily to higher foreign exchange transactional charges. Productivity-driven cost savings delivered 80 basis points of benefit to SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Non-Operating Expenses and Income Interest expense was $222 million for the quarter, an increase of $113 million versus the prior year period due to higher interest rates and an increase in short-term debt in the current fiscal year. Interest income was $83 million for the quarter, an increase of $74 million versus the prior year period due primarily to higher interest rates. Other non-operating income was $179 million, an increase of $32 million versus the prior year period, due to an increase in net non-operating benefits on postretirement benefit plans. Income Taxes For the three months ended March 31, 2023, the effective tax rate increased 280 basis points versus the prior year period to 20.1% due to: • a 120 basis-point increase from lower excess tax benefits of share-based compensation (a 140 basis-point benefit in the current period versus a 260 basis-point benefit in the prior year period) and • a 170 basis-point increase from unfavorable impacts from the geographic mix of current year earnings and cross-border tax impacts. These increases were partially offset by a 10 basis-point decrease from discrete impacts related to uncertain tax positions (a 10 basis-point unfavorable impact in the current period versus a 20 basis-point unfavorable impact in the prior year period). Net Earnings Operating income increased $224 million, or 6%, to $4.2 billion for the quarter, due to the increase in net sales and the increase in operating margin, the components of which are described above. Net earnings increased $57 million, or 2%, to $3.4 billion, as the increase in operating income was partially offset by an increase in the effective tax rate. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of approximately $309 million on net earnings for the quarter, including both transactional and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars. Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $42 million, or 1%, to $3.4 billion for the quarter. Diluted net earnings per share increased 3% to $1.37 versus the prior year period due to the increase in net earnings and a reduction in the weighted average number of shares outstanding. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Nine Months Ended March 31, 2023 The following discussion provides a review of results for the nine months ended March 31, 2023, versus the nine months ended March 31, 2022. Nine Months Ended March 31 Amounts in millions, except per share amounts 2023 2022 % Chg Net sales $61,453 $60,672 1% Operating income 13,972 14,215 (2)% Net earnings 11,346 11,735 (3)% Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 11,269 11,690 (4)% Diluted net earnings per common share 4.53 4.59 (1)% Nine Months Ended March 31 COMPARISONS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES 2023 2022 Basis Pt Chg Gross margin 47.7% 48.3% (60) Selling, general & administrative expense 25.0% 24.9% 10 Operating income 22.7% 23.4% (70) Earnings before income taxes 23.0% 23.6% (60) Net earnings 18.5% 19.3% (80) Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 18.3% 19.3% (100) Net Sales Net sales for the period increased by 1% to $61.5 billion. The increase in net sales was driven by higher pricing of 10% and a favorable mix of 1%, mostly offset by unfavorable foreign exchange of 6% and a 4% decrease in unit volume. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, organic sales increased 7%. Favorable mix is driven by a higher proportion of sales in North America (with higher than company-average selling prices) and decline in Europe (with lower than company-average selling prices). Net sales increased mid-single digits in Health Care, increased low single digits in Fabric & Home Care and Baby, Feminine & Family Care and decreased mid-single digits in Grooming. Net sales were unchanged in Beauty. On a regional basis, volume decreased double digits in Europe, mid-single digits in Greater China and low single digits in North America, Asia Pacific and IMEA. Volume increased low single digits in Latin America. Net Sales Change Drivers 2023 vs. 2022 (Nine Months Ended March 31, 2023) (1) Volume with Acquisitions & Divestitures Volume Excluding Acquisitions & Divestitures Foreign Exchange Price Mix Other (2) Net Sales Growth Beauty (1)% (2)% (6)% 8% (2)% 1% —% Grooming (3)% (3)% (8)% 10% (3)% —% (4)% Health Care (1)% (1)% (5)% 6% 4% —% 4% Fabric & Home Care (5)% (5)% (6)% 12% 1% —% 2% Baby, Feminine & Family Care (4)% (4)% (4)% 8% 1% —% 1% Total Company (4)% (4)% (6)% 10% 1% —% 1% (1) Net sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied. (2) Other includes the sales mix impact from acquisitions and divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile volume to net sales. Operating Costs Gross margin decreased 60 basis points to 47.7% of net sales for the period. The decrease in gross margin was due to: • 390 basis points of increased commodity and input material costs, • a 140 basis-point decline from unfavorable mix due to the launch and growth of premium products (which have lower than Company-average gross margins) and the disproportionate decline of the super-premium SK-II brand, • a 50 basis-point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, • 30 basis points of increased transportation costs, • 20 basis points of product and packaging investments and • 10 basis points due to capacity start-up costs and other manufacturing impacts. These impacts were partially offset by • a 450 basis-point increase due to higher pricing and • 130 basis points of manufacturing productivity savings. Total SG&A spending increased by 2% to $15.3 billion due to increased overhead costs and other operating costs, partially offset by decreased marketing spending. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased 10 basis points to 25.0% as the decrease in marketing spending as a percentage of net sales was more than offset by an increase in overhead and other operating costs as a percentage of net sales. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 100 basis points due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and increased savings. Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales increased 50 basis points due to wage inflation and other cost increases, partially offset by productivity savings and the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase. Other operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 60 basis points due to higher foreign exchange transactional charges and a prior period gain on the sale of real estate. Productivity-driven cost savings delivered 50 basis points of benefit to SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Non-Operating Expenses and Income Interest expense was $516 million for the period, an increase of $192 million versus the prior year period due to an increase in short-term debt in the current period and higher interest rates. Interest income was $191 million for the period, an increase of $161 million versus the prior year period due to higher interest rates. Other non-operating income was $473 million, an increase of $49 million versus the prior year period due primarily to a prior period unrealized loss on equity investments. Income Taxes For the nine months ended March 31, 2023, the effective tax rate increased 140 basis points versus the prior year period to 19.6% due to: • a 130 basis-point increase from lower excess tax benefits of share-based compensation (a 90 basis-point benefit in the current period versus a 220 basis-point benefit in the prior year period) and • a 10 basis-point increase from favorable discrete impacts related to uncertain tax positions in the prior year period. A favorable impact primarily due to the recognition of operating loss carryforwards is fully offset by unfavorable impacts from the geographic mix of current year earnings and cross-border tax impacts. Net Earnings Operating income decreased $243 million, or 2%, to $14.0 billion for the period as the increase in net sales was more than fully offset by the decrease in operating margin, the components of which are described above. Net earnings decreased $389 million, or 3%, to $11.3 billion for the fiscal year to date period due to the decrease in operating income and an increase in the effective tax rate. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of approximately $1.1 billion on net earnings for the period, including both transactional and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars. Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble decreased $421 million, or 4%, to $11.3 billion for the fiscal year to date period. Diluted net earnings per share decreased 1% to $4.53 versus the prior year period due to the decrease in net earnings, partially offset by a reduction in the weighted average number of shares outstanding. BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSION – Three and Nine Months Ended March 31, 2023 The following discussion provides a review of results by reportable business segment. Analysis of the results for the three and nine month periods ended March 31, 2023, is provided based on a comparison to the three and nine month periods ended March 31, 2022. The primary financial measures used to evaluate segment performance are net sales and net earnings. The table below provides supplemental information on net sales, earnings before income taxes and net earnings by reportable business segment for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2023, versus the comparable prior year period (dollar amounts in millions): Three Months Ended March 31, 2023 Net Sales % Change Versus Year Ago Earnings/(Loss) Before Income Taxes % Change Versus Year Ago Net Earnings/(Loss) % Change Versus Year Ago Beauty $ 3,494 3 % $ 763 (4) % $ 608 (6) % Grooming 1,495 1 % 382 8 % 308 6 % Health Care 2,828 6 % 667 7 % 523 8 % Fabric & Home Care 7,016 5 % 1,538 21 % 1,174 21 % Baby, Feminine & Family Care 5,062 3 % 1,206 11 % 925 11 % Corporate 173 N/A (268) N/A (114) N/A Total Company $ 20,068 4 % $ 4,288 5 % $ 3,424 2 % Nine Months Ended March 31, 2023 Net Sales % Change Versus Year Ago Earnings/(Loss) Before Income Taxes % Change Versus Year Ago Net Earnings/(Loss) % Change Versus Year Ago Beauty $ 11,262 — % $ 3,179 (1) % $ 2,530 (2) % Grooming 4,763 (4) % 1,381 (5) % 1,116 (6) % Health Care 8,636 4 % 2,354 6 % 1,826 6 % Fabric & Home Care 21,130 2 % 4,619 8 % 3,517 7 % Baby, Feminine & Family Care 15,061 1 % 3,373 1 % 2,578 — % Corporate 601 N/A (786) N/A (221) N/A Total Company $ 61,453 1 % $ 14,120 (2) % $ 11,346 (3) % Beauty Three months ended March 31, 2023, compared with three months ended March 31, 2022 Beauty net sales increased 3% to $3.5 billion due to the positive impacts of higher pricing of 8% and an increase in unit volume of 1% (including a benefit from acquisitions), partially offset by the negative impacts of unfavorable foreign exchange of 5% and unfavorable mix of 1% (due primarily to the decline of the super-premium SK-II brand, which has higher than segment-average selling prices). Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, organic sales increased 7%. Global market share of the Beauty segment increased 0.3 points. • Hair Care net sales increased mid-single digits. Positive impacts of higher pricing (across all regions) and acquisitions were partially offset by negative impacts of unfavorable foreign exchange. Unit volume was unchanged and mix had a neutral impact on net sales. Volume growth in North America (due to innovation and prior year acquisitions) and Latin America was fully offset by declines in Europe (due primarily to portfolio reduction in Russia) and Greater China (due to disproportionate market contraction in traditional retail channels). Organic sales increased double digits driven by a more than 20% growth in Latin America, a mid-teens increase in North America and a double digit increase in Europe. Global market share of the Hair Care category decreased more than half a point. • Skin and Personal Care net sales increased low single digits. Positive impacts of higher pricing (across all regions), a unit volume increase and benefit from prior year acquisitions were partially offset by the negative impacts of unfavorable mix (due to the decline of the super-premium SK-II brand, which has higher than category-average selling prices) and unfavorable foreign exchange. The volume increase was primarily driven by growth in North America (due to innovation in Personal Care and prior year acquisitions) and Latin America, partially offset by a decline in Asia Pacific (due to the decline of the super-premium SKII brand in the travel retail channel). Organic sales increased low single digits as a double digit increase in North America and a high single digit increase in Greater China were partially offset by a more than 40% decline in Asia Pacific. Global market share of the Skin and Personal Care category increased more than a point. Net earnings decreased 6% to $608 million as the increase in net sales was more than offset by a 160 basis-point decline in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin decreased due to a decline in gross margin, partially offset by a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. The gross margin reduction was driven by negative product mix (due to the decline of the super-premium SK-II brand), increased commodity and input material costs and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, partially offset by increased pricing. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased due primarily to the positive scale effects of the net sales increases, partially offset by an increase in marketing spending. Nine months ended March 31, 2023, compared with nine months ended March 31, 2022 Beauty net sales were unchanged at $11.3 billion as the positive impacts of higher pricing of 8% and benefit from acquisitions of 1% were offset by unfavorable foreign exchange of 6%, unfavorable mix of 2% (due primarily to the decline of the super-premium SK-II brand, which has higher than segment-average selling prices) and a 1% decrease in unit volume. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, organic sales increased 4% on a 2% decrease in organic volume. Global market share of the Beauty segment increased 0.3 points. • Hair Care net sales were unchanged. Negative impacts of unfavorable foreign exchange, a decrease in unit volume and unfavorable geographic and product mix were fully offset by higher pricing (driven by all regions). The volume decrease was driven primarily by declines in Europe (due to portfolio reduction in Russia and increased pricing), Greater China (due to market contraction and pandemic-related disruptions) and Asia Pacific (due to increased pricing). Organic sales increased mid-single digits driven by a high teens growth in Latin America, a double-digit growth in Europe and a high single-digit growth in North America, partially offset by a mid-single digit decline in Greater China. Global market share of the Hair Care category decreased nearly a point. • Skin and Personal Care net sales were unchanged. Negative impacts from unfavorable mix (due to the decline of the super-premium SK-II brand) and unfavorable foreign exchange were fully offset by higher pricing (across all regions), a unit volume increase and benefit from acquisitions. The volume increase was primarily driven by growth in North America (due to innovation), Greater China (due to innovation) and Latin America, partially offset by a decline in Asia Pacific (due to the decline of the super-premium SKII brand in the travel retail channel). Organic sales increased low single digits as a double digit increase in North America was partially offset by a low single-digit decrease in Greater China. Global market share of the Skin and Personal Care category increased more than a point. Net earnings decreased 2% to $2.5 billion due to a 40 basis-point decrease in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin decreased due to a reduction in gross margin, partly offset by a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. The gross margin reduction was driven by negative product mix (due to the decline of the super-premium SK-II brand), increased commodity and input material costs and unfavorable foreign exchange, partly offset by increased pricing. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to a decrease in marketing spending. Grooming Three months ended March 31, 2023, compared with three months ended March 31, 2022 Grooming net sales increased 1% to $1.5 billion as the benefit of higher pricing of 10% (driven by all regions) was partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange of 6%, unfavorable product mix of 2% (primarily within Appliances, which has higher than segment-average selling prices) and a decrease in unit volume of 1%. The volume decline was driven by Europe (due primarily to increased pricing), North America (due to market contraction) and IMEA, partially offset by growth in Greater China (due to market recovery in traditional retailers). Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, Grooming organic sales increased 7% driven by growth across all regions led by a more than 30% growth in Latin America, a low teens growth in Greater China, a double-digit growth in Asia Pacific and a low single-digit growth in Europe. Global market share of the Grooming segment increased 1 point. Net earnings increased 6% to $308 million due to net sales growth and a 110 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin increased due to a decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by a decrease in gross margin and a higher effective tax rate.

Corporate Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business segments. These include but are not limited to incidental businesses managed at the corporate level, gains and losses related to certain divested brands or businesses, impacts from various financing and investing activities, impacts related to employee benefits, asset impairments and restructuring activities including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used within the reportable segments to U.S. GAAP. The most notable ongoing reconciling item is income taxes, which adjusts the blended statutory rates that are reflected in the reportable segments to the overall Company effective tax rate. For the three months ended March 31, 2023, Corporate net sales decreased $42 million to $173 million due to a decrease in sales of incidental businesses managed at the corporate level. Corporate net earnings decreased $257 million to a loss of $114 million for the quarter due to the decrease in net sales of incidental businesses, increased commodity costs tied to incidental businesses and higher foreign exchange transactional charges. For the fiscal year to date period, Corporate net sales improved by $96 million to $601 million, due to an increase in sales of the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level. Corporate net earnings declined by $603 million to a loss of $221 million, as the net sales growth of incidental businesses was more than offset by increased commodity costs tied to the incidental businesses, higher foreign exchange transactional charges and prior period gain on the sale of real estate. LIQUIDITY & CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating Activities We generated $11.5 billion of cash from operating activities fiscal year to date, a decrease of $1.5 billion versus the prior year period. Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, deferred income taxes and gain on sale of assets), generated $13.4 billion of operating cash flow. Working capital and other impacts used $1.9 billion of cash in the period. Accounts receivable increased, using $301 million of cash, driven by sales growth. Days sales outstanding increased by one day. Total inventories increased, consuming $503 million of cash driven by increased safety stock levels to strengthen supply chain sufficiency. Days on hand increased by four days. Accounts payable, accrued and other net operating assets and liabilities decreased, using $1.4 billion of cash, primarily driven by postretirement benefit payments, net periodic credit from other retiree benefits, and reduced raw and packaging material purchases to adjust supply chain activities to volume trends. Days payable outstanding decreased by seven days. Investing Activities Investing activities used $2.7 billion of cash fiscal year to date primarily driven by capital expenditures and acquisitions. Financing Activities Financing activities used $8.3 billion of net cash fiscal year to date. We used $7.4 billion for treasury stock purchases and $6.7 billion for dividends. We generated $4.9 billion from net debt increases and $861 million from the exercise of stock options and other impacts. As of March 31, 2023, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $15.7 billion. We have short- and long-term debt to meet our financing needs. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements. RECONCILIATION OF MEASURES NOT DEFINED BY U.S. GAAP In accordance with the SEC's Regulation S-K Item 10(e), the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measure. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful perspective on underlying business trends and provide a supplemental measure of period-to-period financial results. Disclosing these non-GAAP financial measures allows investors and management to view our operating results excluding the impact of items that are not reflective of the underlying operating performance. Management uses these non-GAAP measures in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. Certain of these measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures do not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. Therefore, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Organic sales growth: Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. This measure is used in assessing achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. Adjusted free cash flow: Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and adjusted for transitional tax payments resulting from the U.S. Tax Act. Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. Management views adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments. Adjusted free cash flow productivity: Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings. Management views adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G’s ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. This measure is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. Core EPS: Core earnings per share, or Core EPS, is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share excluding items that are not judged to be part of the Company's sustainable results or trends. For the three and nine months ended March 31, 2023, and March 31, 2022, there were no adjustments to or reconciling items for diluted net earnings per share. Management views this non-GAAP measure as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time. This measure is also used when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation.

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Basis of Presentation These statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of The Procter & Gamble Company and subsidiaries (the ""Company,"" ""Procter & Gamble,"" ""P&G,"" ""we"" or ""our"") contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods reported. However, the results of operations included in such financial statements may not necessarily be indicative of annual results. 2. New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies In November 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2021-10, ""Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance"". This guidance requires annual disclosures for transactions with a government authority that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution model. These amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted. We have completed our evaluation of significant transactions. The guidance has not had, and is not expected to have, a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, ""Liabilities - Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations"". This guidance requires annual and interim disclosures for entities that use supplier finance programs in connection with the purchase of goods and services. These amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, except for the amendment on rollforward information, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. We are currently assessing the impact of this guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements. No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had, or is expected to have, a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 3.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill is allocated by reportable segment as follows: Beauty Grooming Health Care Fabric & Home Care Baby, Feminine & Family Care Total Company Goodwill at June 30, 2022 $ 13,296 $ 12,571 $ 7,589 $ 1,808 $ 4,436 $ 39,700 Acquisitions and divestitures — — — — 34 34 Translation and other 88 53 44 4 28 217 Goodwill at December 31, 2022 $ 13,384 $ 12,624 $ 7,633 $ 1,812 $ 4,498 $ 39,951 Goodwill increased from June 30, 2022 primarily due to minor brand acquisitions in the Baby, Feminine & Family Care segment and currency translation. Identifiable intangible assets at December 31, 2022 were comprised of: Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Intangible assets with determinable lives $ 8,897 $ ( 6,268 ) Intangible assets with indefinite lives 20,965 — Total identifiable intangible assets $ 29,862 $ ( 6,268 ) Intangible assets with determinable lives consist of brands, patents, technology and customer relationships. The intangible assets with indefinite lives primarily consist of brands. The amortization expense of determinable-lived intangible assets for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 79 and $ 74 , respectively. For the six-months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, amortization expense was $ 159 and $ 151 , respectively. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment. We use the income method to estimate the fair value of these assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. If the resulting fair value is less than the asset's carrying value, that difference represents an impairment. Most of our goodwill reporting units have fair value cushions that significantly exceed their underlying carrying values. In connection with the Grooming operating segment integration as described further in Note 3, we concluded that the Shave Care and Appliances categories are one reporting unit (Grooming) for goodwill impairment testing. Based on our impairment testing performed during the three months ended December 31, 2022, our Grooming goodwill reporting unit, which is comprised entirely of acquired businesses, has a fair value cushion of over 30 % and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset's fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 5 %. The Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is most susceptible to future impairment risk. Adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment, including foreign currency devaluation, increasing global inflation, market contraction from an economic recession and the Russia-Ukraine War, could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset and trigger a future impairment charge. Further reduction of the Gillette business activities in Russia could reduce the estimated fair value by up to 5%. The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the net sales growth rates (including residual growth rates), discount rate and royalty rates. Net sales growth rates could be negatively impacted by reductions or changes in demand for our Gillette products, which may be caused by, among other things: changes in the use and frequency of grooming products, shifts in demand away from one or more of our higher priced products to lower priced products or potential supply chain constraints. In addition, relative global and country/regional macroeconomic factors, including the Russia-Ukraine War, could result in additional and prolonged devaluation of other countries' currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The residual growth rates represent the expected rate at which the Gillette brand is expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period. The residual growth rates utilized in our fair value estimates are consistent with the brand operating plans and approximate expected long-term category market growth rates. The residual growth rate depends on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, relative currency exchange rates and business activities that impact market share. As a result, the residual growth rate could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes, devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or an increased competitive environment. The discount rate, which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. capital structure. Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, such as further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar. Spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the U.S. The royalty rate used to determine the estimated fair value for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is driven by historical and estimated future profitability of the underlying Gillette business. The royalty rate may be impacted by significant adverse changes in long-term operating margins. We performed a sensitivity analysis for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset during our annual impairment testing, utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the discount rate, the short-term and residual growth rates and the royalty rates to demonstrate the potential impacts to estimated fair values. The table below provides, in isolation, the estimated fair value impacts related to a 25 basis-point increase in the discount rate, a 25 basis-point decrease in our short-term and residual growth rates or a 50 basis-point decrease in our royalty rates, which may result in an impairment of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset. Approximate Percent Change in Estimated Fair Value +25 bps Discount Rate -25 bps Growth Rates -50 bps Royalty Rate Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset ( 6 )% ( 6 )% ( 4 )% 5. Earnings Per Share Basic net earnings per common share are calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble less preferred dividends by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net earnings per common share are calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble by the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The diluted shares include the dilutive effect of stock options and other stock-based awards based on the treasury stock method and the assumed conversion of preferred stock. Net earnings per share were calculated as follows: CONSOLIDATED AMOUNTS Three Months Ended December 31 Six Months Ended December 31 2022 2021 2022 2021 Net earnings $ 3,959 $ 4,242 $ 7,922 $ 8,368 Less: Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 26 19 50 33 Net earnings attributable to P&G (Diluted) 3,933 4,223 7,872 8,335 Less: Preferred dividends 70 70 141 140 Net earnings attributable to P&G available to common shareholders (Basic) $ 3,863 $ 4,153 $ 7,731 $ 8,195 SHARES IN MILLIONS Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 2,365.9 2,413.4 2,375.7 2,420.7 Add: Effect of dilutive securities Convertible preferred shares (1) 76.7 79.6 77.0 80.1 Stock options and other unvested equity awards (2) 38.6 51.2 39.7 50.8 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 2,481.2 2,544.2 2,492.4 2,551.6 NET EARNINGS PER SHARE (3) Basic $ 1.63 $ 1.72 $ 3.25 $ 3.39 Diluted $ 1.59 $ 1.66 $ 3.16 $ 3.27 (1) An overview of preferred shares can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. (2) Excludes 22 million and 14 million for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and 19 million and 13 million for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, of weighted average stock options outstanding because the exercise price of these options was greater than their average market value or their effect was antidilutive. (3) Net earnings per share are calculated on Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. 6. Share-Based Compensation and Postretirement Benefits The following table provides a summary of our share-based compensation expense and postretirement benefit impacts: Three Months Ended December 31 Six Months Ended December 31 2022 2021 2022 2021 Share-based compensation expense $ 145 $ 152 $ 250 $ 268 Net periodic benefit cost for pension benefits 44 47 87 95 Net periodic benefit credit for other retiree benefits ( 132 ) ( 119 ) ( 264 ) ( 222 ) 7. Risk Management Activities and Fair Value Measurements As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. There have been no significant changes in our risk management policies or activities during the six months ended December 31, 2022. The Company has not changed its valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period. The Company recognizes transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of each quarter. There were no transfers between levels during the periods presented. Also, there was no significant activity within the Level 3 assets and liabilities during the periods presented. There were no significant assets or liabilities that were remeasured at fair value on a non-recurring basis for the six months ended December 31, 2022. Cash equivalents were $ 5.1 billion and $ 6.0 billion as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively, and are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. Other investments had a fair value of $ 86 and $ 140 as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively, including equity securities of $ 60 and $ 113 as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively, and are presented in Other noncurrent assets. Investments measured at fair value are primarily classified as Level 1 and Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Level 1 are based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets. Level 2 are based on quoted market prices for similar instruments. There are no material investment balances classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy or using net asset value as a practical expedient. Unrealized losses on equity securities were $ 1 and $ 2 during the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Unrealized gains/(losses) on equity securities were $ 8 and $( 31 ) during the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. These unrealized gains/(losses) are recognized in Other non-operating income, net. The fair value of long-term debt was $ 22.7 billion and $ 25.7 billion as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. This includes the current portion of long-term debt instruments ($ 3.6 billion as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022). Certain long-term debt (debt designated as a fair value hedge) is recorded at fair value. All other long-term debt is recorded at amortized cost but is measured at fair value for disclosure purposes. We consider our debt to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Fair values are generally estimated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments. Disclosures about Financial Instruments The notional amounts and fair values of financial instruments used in hedging transactions as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022 are as follows: Notional Amount Fair Value Asset Fair Value (Liability) December 31, 2022 June 30, 2022 December 31, 2022 June 30, 2022 December 31, 2022 June 30, 2022 DERIVATIVES IN FAIR VALUE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Interest rate contracts $ 3,983 $ 4,972 $ — $ 3 $ ( 484 ) $ ( 307 ) DERIVATIVES IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Foreign currency interest rate contracts $ 11,381 $ 7,943 $ 47 $ 561 $ ( 474 ) $ ( 1 ) TOTAL DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS $ 15,364 $ 12,915 $ 47 $ 564 $ ( 958 ) $ ( 308 ) DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS Foreign currency contracts $ 5,203 $ 5,625 $ 47 $ 6 $ ( 4 ) $ ( 61 ) TOTAL DERIVATIVES AT FAIR VALUE $ 20,567 $ 18,540 $ 94 $ 570 $ ( 962 ) $ ( 369 ) Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. The fair value of the interest rate derivative asset/(liability) directly offsets the cumulative amount of the fair value hedging adjustment included in the carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation. The carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation, which includes the unamortized discount or premium and the fair value adjustment, was $ 3.5 billion and $ 4.7 billion as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges. The carrying value of those debt instruments designated as net investment hedges, which includes the adjustment for the foreign currency transaction gain or loss on those instruments, was $ 10.2 billion and $ 11.2 billion as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. The increase in the notional balance of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges is partially offset by the decrease in debt designated as a net investment hedge due to maturities. The net increase in the total amount of instruments designated as net investment hedges is primarily driven by the Company's decision to leverage favorable interest rate spreads in the foreign currency swap market. All derivative assets are presented in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Other noncurrent assets. All derivative liabilities are presented in Accrued and other liabilities or Other noncurrent liabilities. Changes in the fair value of net investment hedges are recognized in the Foreign currency translation component of Other comprehensive income (OCI). All of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Substantially all of the Company's financial instruments used in hedging transactions are governed by industry standard netting and collateral agreements with counterparties. If the Company's credit rating were to fall below the levels stipulated in the agreements, the counterparties could demand either collateralization or termination of the arrangements. The aggregate fair value of the instruments covered by these contractual features that are in a net liability position was $ 911 and $ 219 as of December 31, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. The Company has not been required to post collateral as a result of these contractual features. Before tax gains on our financial instruments in hedging relationships are categorized as follows: Amount of Gain/(Loss) Recognized in OCI on Derivatives Three Months Ended December 31 Six Months Ended December 31 2022 2021 2022 2021 DERIVATIVES IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS (1) (2) Foreign exchange contracts $ (1,013) $ 218 $ (305) $ 426 (1) For the derivatives in net investment hedging relationships, the amount of gain excluded from effectiveness testing, which was recognized in earnings, was $ 69 and $ 17 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The amount of gain excluded from effectiveness testing was $ 115 and $ 32 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. (2) In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges. The amount of gain/(loss) recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) for such instruments was $( 862 ) and $ 264 for the three months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The amount of gain/(loss) recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) for such instruments was $( 164 ) and $ 567 for the six months ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Amount of Gain/(Loss) Recognized in Earnings Three Months Ended December 31 Six Months Ended December 31 2022 2021 2022 2021 DERIVATIVES IN FAIR VALUE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Interest rate contracts $ ( 49 ) $ ( 61 ) $ ( 180 ) $ ( 97 ) DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS Foreign currency contracts $ 95 $ 54 $ ( 51 ) $ 30 The loss on the derivatives in fair value hedging relationships is fully offset by the mark-to-market impact of the related exposure. These are both recognized in Interest expense. The loss on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is substantially offset by the currency mark-to-market of the related exposure. These are both recognized in Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A). Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. 8. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss) The table below presents the changes in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) attributable to Procter & Gamble (AOCI), including the reclassifications out of AOCI by component: Investment Securities Post-retirement Benefit Plans Foreign Currency Translation Total AOCI Balance at June 30, 2022 $ 20 $ 27 $ ( 12,236 ) $ ( 12,189 ) OCI before reclassifications (1) ( 3 ) 2 ( 333 ) ( 334 ) Amounts reclassified to the Consolidated Statement of Earnings (2) — 9 — 9 Net current period OCI ( 3 ) 11 ( 333 ) ( 325 ) Less: OCI attributable to non-controlling interests — — ( 8 ) ( 8 ) Balance at December 31, 2022 $ 17 $ 38 $ ( 12,561 ) $ ( 12,506 ) (1) Net of tax (benefit)/expense of $( 1 ), $( 4 ) and $( 110 ) for gains/losses on investment securities, postretirement benefit plans and foreign currency translation, respectively. Income tax effects within foreign currency translation include impacts from items such as net investment hedge transactions. (2) Net of tax (benefit)/expense of $ 0 , $ 4 and $ 0 for gains/losses on investment securities, postretirement benefit plans and foreign currency translation, respectively. Postretirement benefit plan amounts are reclassified from AOCI into Other non-operating income, net and included in the computation of net periodic postretirement costs. 9. Commitments and Contingencies Litigation We are subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental, patent and trademark matters, labor and employment matters and tax. While considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management and our counsel, the ultimate resolution of the various lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior manufacturing and waste disposal practices. Based on currently available information, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of environmental remediation will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Income Tax Uncertainties The Company is present in approximately 70 countries and over 150 taxable jurisdictions and, at any point in time, has 40 – 50 jurisdictional audits underway at various stages of completion. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite our belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitations. Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate. We have tax years open ranging from 2010 and forward. We are generally not able to reliably estimate the ultimate settlement amounts until the close of an audit. Based on information currently available, we anticipate that over the next 12-month period, audit activity could be completed related to uncertain tax positions in multiple jurisdictions for which we have accrued existing liabilities of approximately $ 140 , including interest and penalties. Additional information on the Commitments and Contingencies of the Company can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. Item 2.

Purpose, Approach and Non-GAAP Measures The purpose of Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is to provide an understanding of Procter & Gamble's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. The MD&A is organized into the following sections: • Overview • Summary of Results – Six months ended December 31, 2022 • Economic Conditions and Uncertainties • Results of Operations – Three and Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 • Business Segment Discussion – Three and Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 • Liquidity and Capital Resources • Reconciliation of Measures Not Defined by U.S. GAAP Throughout the MD&A, we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales, net earnings, diluted net earnings per share and operating cash flow. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) that include organic sales growth, core net earnings per share (Core EPS), adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity. The explanation at the end of the MD&A provides the definition of these non-GAAP measures, details on the use and the derivation of these measures, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition, despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and market consumption in the MD&A are based on a combination of vendor purchased traditional brick-and-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales of our products in dollar terms on a constant currency basis relative to all product sales in the category. The Company measures fiscal year to date market shares through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months as compared to the end of the reporting period. Management also uses unit volume growth to evaluate and explain drivers of changes in net sales. Organic volume growth reflects year-over-year changes in unit volume excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and certain one-time items, if applicable, and is used to explain changes in organic sales. OVERVIEW P&G is a global leader in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world.

The following table provides the percentage of net sales and net earnings by reportable business segment (excluding Corporate) for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022: Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 Net Sales Net Earnings Net Sales Net Earnings Beauty 18% 23% 19% 24% Grooming 8% 10% 8% 10% Health Care 15% 17% 14% 16% Fabric & Home Care 34% 29% 34% 29% Baby, Feminine & Family Care 25% 21% 25% 21% Total Company 100% 100% 100% 100% SUMMARY OF RESULTS The following are highlights of results for the six months ended December 31, 2022 versus the six months ended December 31, 2021: • Net sales were unchanged versus the prior period, at $41.4 billion. Net sales increased by low single-digits in Health Care and Fabric & Home Care and were fully offset by a decrease of high single digits in Grooming and low single digits in Beauty. Net Sales in Baby, Feminine & Family Care was unchanged. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, increased 6%. Organic sales increased high single digits in Health Care and Fabric & Home Care, increased mid-single digits in Baby, Feminine & Family Care and increased low single digits in Grooming and Beauty. • Net earnings were $7.9 billion, a decrease of $446 million, or 5%, versus the prior year period due to a decrease in operating margin. • Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble were $7.9 billion, a decrease of $463 million, or 6%, versus the prior year. • Diluted net earnings per share (EPS) decreased 3% to $3.16 due primarily to the decrease in net earnings, partially offset by a reduction in the weighted average shares outstanding. • Operating cash flow was $7.6 billion. Adjusted free cash flow, which is defined as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and transitional tax payments resulting from the U.S. Tax Act beginning in 2019, was $6.3 billion. Adjusted free cash flow productivity, which is defined as adjusted free cash flow as a percentage of net earnings, was 79%. ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTI ES Global Economic Conditions. Our products are sold in numerous countries across North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa, with more than half our sales generated outside the United States. As such, we are exposed to and impacted by global macroeconomic factors, U.S. and foreign government policies and foreign exchange fluctuations. Current macroeconomic factors remain very dynamic, and any causes of market size contraction, such as COVID-19 related disruptions or lockdowns, greater political unrest or instability in the Middle East, Central and Eastern Europe (including the ongoing Russia-Ukraine War), certain Latin American markets and the Korean peninsula could reduce our sales or erode our operating margin and consequently reduce our net earnings and cash flows. Changes in Costs. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity and input material prices, transportation and labor costs, broader inflationary impacts and our own productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities and input materials, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp. Volatility in the market price of these commodities and input materials has a direct impact on our costs. Disruptions in our manufacturing, supply and distribution operations, including due to COVID-19 related lockdowns, energy shortages, port congestions, labor constraints, freight container and truck shortages and inflation have impacted our costs and could do so in the future. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. Increased pricing in response to certain inflationary impacts or cost increases may also offset portions of the impacts, however such increases may impact product consumption. If we are unable to manage these impacts through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions, as well as through consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. Foreign Exchange. We have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates. Translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation of transaction-related working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. Historically, weakening of certain foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar have resulted in significant foreign exchange impacts leading to lower net sales, net earnings and cash flows. Certain countries experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations such as Argentina, Brazil, United Kingdom, Japan, Russia and Turkey have had, and could continue to have, a significant impact on our net sales, net earnings and cash flows. Increased pricing in response to certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could also have a negative impact on the consumption of our products, which would negatively affect our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. Government Policies. Our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government legislative, regulatory or enforcement policies. On August 16, 2022, the ""Inflation Reduction Act"" (H.R. 5376) was signed into law in the United States. We do not currently expect the Inflation Reduction Act to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. Our net earnings and cash flows could be affected by any future legislative or regulatory changes in U.S. or non-U.S. tax policy, or any significant change in global tax policy adopted under the current work being led by the OECD for the G20 focused on ""Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy"". Our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows may also be impacted by changes in U.S. and foreign government policies related to environmental and climate change matters. Additionally, we attempt to carefully manage our debt, currency and other exposures in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and pricing controls, such as Argentina, Egypt, Nigeria and Pakistan. Our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes to international trade agreements in North America and elsewhere. Changes in government policies in the above areas might cause an increase or decrease in our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. Russia-Ukraine War. The war between Russia and Ukraine has negatively impacted our operations in both countries. Our Ukraine business includes two manufacturing sites. We have approximately 500 employees including both manufacturing and non-manufacturing personnel. Our operations in Ukraine accounted for less than 1% of consolidated net sales and net earnings in fiscal 2022. Additionally, net assets of our Ukraine subsidiary, along with Ukraine related assets held by other subsidiaries, account for less than 1% of net assets as of December 31, 2022. Our Russia business includes two manufacturing sites with a net book value of approximately $250 million as of December 31, 2022. We have approximately 1,800 employees, including both manufacturing and non-manufacturing personnel. In fiscal 2022, our operations in Russia accounted for less than 2% of consolidated net sales and less than 1% of net earnings. Additionally, net assets of our Russia subsidiaries, along with Russia related assets held by other subsidiaries, account for less than 2% of net assets as of December 31, 2022. Beginning in March 2022, the Company reduced its product portfolio, discontinued new capital investments and suspended media, advertising and promotional activity in Russia. Future impacts to the Company are difficult to predict due to the high level of uncertainty related to the war’s duration, evolution and resolution. Within Ukraine, there is a possibility of physical damage and destruction of our two manufacturing facilities. We may not be able to operate our manufacturing sites and source raw materials from our suppliers or ship finished products to our customers. Ultimately, these could result in impairments of our manufacturing plants and fixed assets or write-downs of other operating assets and working capital. Within Russia, we may not be able to continue our reduced operations at current levels due to sanctions and counter-sanctions, monetary, currency or payment controls, legislative restrictions or policies, restrictions on access to financial institutions and supply and transportation challenges. Our suppliers, distributors and retail customers are also impacted by the war and their ability to successfully maintain their operations could also impact our operations or negatively impact the sales of our products. More broadly, there could be additional negative impacts to our net sales, earnings and cash flows should the situation escalate beyond its current scope, including, among other potential impacts, economic recessions in certain neighboring countries or globally due to inflationary pressures and supply chain cost increases or the geographic proximity of the war relative to the rest of Europe. For a more complete discussion of the risks we encounter in our business, please refer to Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 The following discussion provides a review of results for the three months ended December 31, 2022 versus the three months ended December 31, 2021. Three Months Ended December 31 Amounts in millions, except per share amounts 2022 2021 % Chg Net sales $20,773 $20,953 (1)% Operating income 4,785 5,168 (7)% Net earnings 3,959 4,242 (7)% Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 3,933 4,223 (7)% Diluted net earnings per common share 1.59 1.66 (4)% Three Months Ended December 31 COMPARISONS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES 2022 2021 Basis Pt Chg Gross margin 47.5% 49.1% (160) Selling, general & administrative expense 24.5% 24.4% 10 Operating income 23.0% 24.7% (170) Earnings before income taxes 23.3% 25.0% (170) Net earnings 19.1% 20.2% (110) Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 18.9% 20.2% (130) Net Sales Net sales for the quarter decreased 1% to $20.8 billion. The decrease in net sales was due to unfavorable foreign exchange of 6% and a decrease in unit volume of 6%, partially offset by higher pricing of 10% and favorable mix of 1%. Favorable mix was driven by the disproportionate growth in Personal Health Care (which has higher than Company-average selling prices) and the disproportionate decline of Europe (which has lower than Company-average selling prices). Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, organic sales increased 5%. Net Sales increased low single digits in Health Care and Fabric & Home Care, decreased high single digits in Grooming and decreased low single digits in Beauty and Baby, Feminine & Family Care. On a regional basis, volume decreased low teens in Europe, decreased high single digits in Greater China and decreased low single digits in North America, Asia Pacific and IMEA. Volume in Latin America was unchanged.

(2) Other includes the sales mix impact from acquisitions and divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile volume to net sales. Operating Costs Gross margin decreased 160 basis points to 47.5% of net sales for the quarter. The decrease in gross margin was due to: • 380 basis points of increased commodity and input material costs, • a 130 basis-point decline from unfavorable mix due to the growth of premium products (which have lower than Company-average gross margins) and the disproportionate decline of the super-premium SK-II brand, • 90 basis points due to capacity start-up costs and other impacts, • 20 basis points of increased transportation costs, • 20 basis points of product and packaging investments, • a 60 basis-point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange impacts and • a 10 basis-point decline from decreased cost leverage. These impacts were partially offset by • a 470 basis-point increase due to higher pricing and • 80 basis points of manufacturing productivity savings. Total SG&A spending decreased 1% to $5.1 billion due to decreased marketing spending partially offset by increased overhead costs and other operating costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased 10 basis points to 24.5% due to an increase in overhead and other operating costs as a percentage of sales, partially offset by a decrease in marketing spending as a percentage of sales. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 90 basis points due primarily to the positive scale impacts of the organic sales increase. Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales increased 40 basis points due to wage inflation and other cost increases, partially offset by the positive scale impacts of the organic sales increase. Other operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 50 basis points due primarily to higher foreign exchange transactional charges. Productivity-driven cost savings delivered 30 basis points of benefit to SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Non-Operating Expenses and Income Interest expense was $171 million for the quarter, an increase of $65 million versus the prior year period due to an increase in short-term debt and higher interest rates. Interest income was $66 million for the quarter, an increase of $56 million versus the prior year period due to higher interest rates. Other non-operating income was $155 million, a decrease of $12 million versus the prior year period. Income Taxes For the three months ended December 31, 2022, the effective tax rate decreased 90 basis points versus the prior year period to 18.1% due to: • a 180 basis-point decrease primarily due to the recognition of operating loss carryforwards partially offset by changes to foreign-derived intangible income and • a 30 basis-point decrease from discrete impacts related to uncertain tax positions (a 20 basis-point favorable impact in the current period versus a 10 basis-point unfavorable impact in the prior year period). These decreases were partially offset by a 120 basis-point increase from lower excess tax benefits of share-based compensation (an 80 basis-point benefit in the current period versus a 200 basis-point benefit in the prior year period). Net Earnings Operating income decreased $383 million, or 7%, to $4.8 billion for the quarter, due to the decrease in net sales and the decrease in operating margin, the components of which are described above. Net earnings decreased $283 million, or 7%, to $4.0 billion as the decrease in operating income was partially offset by a decrease in effective tax rate. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of approximately $405 million on net earnings for the quarter, including both transactional and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars. Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble decreased $290 million, or 7%, to $3.9 billion for the quarter. Diluted net earnings per share decreased 4% to $1.59 versus the prior year period due to the decrease in net earnings, partially offset by a reduction in the weighted average number of shares outstanding. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 The following discussion provides a review of results for the six months ended December 31, 2022 versus the six months ended December 31, 2021. Six Months Ended December 31 Amounts in millions, except per share amounts 2022 2021 % Chg Net sales $41,385 $41,291 —% Operating income 9,724 10,191 (5)% Net earnings 7,922 8,368 (5)% Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 7,872 8,335 (6)% Diluted net earnings per common share 3.16 3.27 (3)% Six Months Ended December 31 COMPARISONS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES 2022 2021 Basis Pt Chg Gross margin 47.5% 49.1% (160) Selling, general & administrative expense 24.0% 24.4% (40) Operating income 23.5% 24.7% (120) Earnings before income taxes 23.8% 24.9% (110) Net earnings 19.1% 20.3% (120) Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 19.0% 20.2% (120) Net Sales Net sales for the period were unchanged versus the previous period at $41.4 billion on a 4% decrease in unit volume. Higher pricing increased net sales by 9%. Positive mix increased net sales by 1% driven by the disproportionate growth in Personal Health Care (which has higher than Company-average selling prices) and the disproportionate decline of Europe (which has lower than Company-average selling prices). Unfavorable foreign exchange had a 6% negative impact on net sales. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, organic sales increased 6%. Net sales increased low single digits in Health Care and Fabric & Home Care and decreased high single digits in Grooming and low single digits in Beauty. Net sales was unchanged for Baby, Feminine & Family Care. On a regional basis, volume decreased double digits in Europe, mid-single digits in Greater China and low single digits in North America and IMEA. Volume increased low single digits in Latin America and Asia Pacific.

(2) Other includes the sales mix impact from acquisitions and divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile volume to net sales. Operating Costs Gross margin decreased 160 basis points to 47.5% of net sales for the period. The decrease in gross margin was due to: • 450 basis points of increased commodity and input material costs, • a 80 basis-point decline from unfavorable mix due to the growth of premium products (which have lower than Company-average gross margins) and the disproportionate decline of the super-premium SK-II brand, • 40 basis points of increased transportation costs, • 30 basis points of product and packaging investments, • 40 basis points due to capacity start-up costs and other impacts, • a 40 basis-point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange impacts and • a 10 basis-point decline from decreased cost leverage. These impacts were partially offset by • a 440 basis-point increase due to higher pricing and • 90 basis points of manufacturing productivity savings. Total SG&A spending decreased 2% to $9.9 billion due to decreased marketing spending partially offset by increased overhead costs and other operating costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 40 basis points to 24% due primarily to a decrease in marketing spending as a percentage of sales, partially offset by an increase in overhead and other operating costs as a percentage of sales. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 150 basis points due to the positive scale impacts of the organic sales increase, increased savings in promotion-related and agency costs and lower media spending. Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales increased 40 basis points due to wage inflation and other cost increases, partially offset by the positive scale impacts of the organic sales increase. Other operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 60 basis points due to a prior period gain on the sale of real estate and higher foreign exchange transactional charges. Productivity-driven cost savings delivered 80 basis points of benefit to SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Non-Operating Expenses and Income Interest expense was $294 million for the period, an increase of $79 million versus the prior year period due to an increase in short-term debt and higher interest rates. Interest income was $108 million for the period, an increase of $87 million versus the prior year period due to higher interest rates. Other non-operating income was $294 million, an increase of $17 million primarily due to a prior period unrealized loss on equity investments. Income Taxes For the six months ended December 31, 2022, the effective tax rate increased 80 basis points versus the prior year period to 19.4% due to: • a 120 basis-point increase from lower excess tax benefits of share-based compensation (a 70 basis-point benefit in the current period versus a 190 basis-point benefit in the prior year period), • a 30 basis-point increase from unfavorable impacts from the geographic mix of current year earnings and • a 20 basis-point increase from discrete impacts related to uncertain tax positions (a 0 basis-point impact in the current period versus a 20 basis-point favorable impact in the prior year period). These increases are partially offset by a 90 basis-point decrease primarily due to the recognition of operating loss carryforwards partially offset by changes to foreign-derived intangible income. Net Earnings Operating income decreased $467 million, or 5%, to $9.7 billion for the period due to the decrease in operating margin, the components of which are described above. Net earnings decreased $446 million or, 5%, to $7.9 billion for the fiscal year to date period due to the decrease in operating income and an increase in the effective tax rate. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of approximately $786 million on net earnings for the period, including both transactional and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars. Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble decreased $463 million or, 6%, to $7.9 billion for the fiscal year to date period. Diluted net earnings per share decreased 3% to $3.16 versus the prior year period due to the decrease in net earnings, partially offset by a reduction in the weighted average number of shares outstanding.

Analysis of the results for the three and six month periods ended December 31, 2022 is provided based on a comparison to the three and six month periods ended December 31, 2021. The primary financial measures used to evaluate segment performance are net sales and net earnings. The table below provides supplemental information on net sales, earnings before income taxes and net earnings by reportable business segment for the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 versus the comparable prior year period (dollar amounts in millions): Three Months Ended December 31, 2022 Net Sales % Change Versus Year Ago Earnings/(Loss) Before Income Taxes % Change Versus Year Ago Net Earnings/(Loss) % Change Versus Year Ago Beauty $ 3,807 (3) % $ 1,145 (3) % $ 911 (4) % Grooming 1,643 (9) % 496 (14) % 404 (15) % Health Care 3,051 2 % 887 (2) % 686 (2) % Fabric & Home Care 7,032 1 % 1,538 5 % 1,171 3 % Baby, Feminine & Family Care 5,065 (1) % 1,112 (6) % 848 (7) % Corporate 175 N/A (343) N/A (61) N/A Total Company $ 20,773 (1) % $ 4,835 (8) % $ 3,959 (7) % Six Months Ended December 31, 2022 Net Sales % Change Versus Year Ago Earnings/(Loss) Before Income Taxes % Change Versus Year Ago Net Earnings/(Loss) % Change Versus Year Ago Beauty $ 7,768 (2) % $ 2,416 — % $ 1,922 (1) % Grooming 3,268 (7) % 999 (9) % 808 (10) % Health Care 5,808 3 % 1,687 5 % 1,303 6 % Fabric & Home Care 14,114 1 % 3,081 2 % 2,343 1 % Baby, Feminine & Family Care 9,999 — % 2,167 (4) % 1,653 (5) % Corporate 428 N/A (518) N/A (107) N/A Total Company $ 41,385 — % $ 9,832 (4) % $ 7,922 (5) % Beauty Three months ended December 31, 2022 compared with three months ended December 31, 2021 Beauty net sales decreased 3% to $3.8 billion, as the negative impacts of unfavorable foreign exchange of 8%, unfavorable mix of 2% (due primarily to the decline of the SK-II brand, which has higher than segment-average selling prices) and a decrease in unit volume of 4% were partially offset by the favorable benefits of higher pricing of 9% and acquisitions of 2%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange, organic sales increased 3%. Global market share of the Beauty segment increased 0.3 points. • Hair Care net sales decreased mid-single digits. Negative impacts of unfavorable foreign exchange and a decrease in unit volume were partially offset by higher pricing (across all regions). The volume decrease was driven primarily by declines in Europe (due to portfolio reduction in Russia and increased pricing), Greater China (due to market contraction and COVID-related disruptions), Asia Pacific (due to increased pricing) and North America (due to market contraction). Organic sales increased mid-single digits driven by a high teens increase in Latin America and high single-digit increases in Europe and North America, partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in Greater China. Global market share of the Hair Care category decreased a point. • Skin and Personal Care net sales decreased low single digits. Negative impacts of unfavorable mix (due to the decline of the super premium SK-II brand) and unfavorable foreign exchange were partially offset by higher pricing (across all regions), a unit volume increase and benefit from acquisitions. Volume increase was primarily driven by growth in Greater China (due to innovation), North America (due to innovation) and Latin America, partially offset by a decline in Asia Pacific (due to increased pricing). Organic sales increased low single digits as a double digit increase in North America was partially offset by a low single-digit decrease in Greater China. Global market share of the Skin and Personal Care category increased more than a point. Net earnings decreased 4% to $0.9 billion due to the decrease in net sales and a 20 basis-point decrease in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin decreased as a decrease in gross margin and a higher effective tax rate were offset by a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. The gross margin reduction was driven by increased commodity and input material costs, unfavorable foreign exchange impacts and negative product mix (due to the decline of the super-premium SK-II brand), partially offset by increased pricing. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to a decrease in marketing spending, partially offset by an increase in overhead spending. The higher effective tax rate was driven by unfavorable geographic mix. Six months ended December 31, 2022 compared with six months ended December 31, 2021 Beauty net sales decreased 2% to $7.8 billion, as the negative impacts of unfavorable foreign exchange of 7%, unfavorable mix of 2% (due primarily to the decline of the SK-II brand, which has higher than segment-average selling prices) and a 2% decrease in unit volume were partially offset by higher pricing of 8% and benefit from acquisitions of 2%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange, organic sales increased 3% on a 3% decrease in organic volume. Global market share of the Beauty segment increased 0.3 points. • Hair Care net sales decreased low single digits. Negative impacts of unfavorable foreign exchange and a decrease in unit volume were partially offset by higher pricing (driven by all regions). The volume decrease was driven primarily by declines in Europe (due to portfolio reduction in Russia and increased pricing), Greater China (due to market contraction and COVID-related disruptions) and North America (due to market contraction and increased pricing). Organic sales increased mid-single digits driven by a mid-teens growth in Latin America, a high single-digit growth in Europe and a mid-single-digit growth in North America, partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in Greater China. Global market share of the Hair Care category decreased a point. • Skin and Personal Care net sales were unchanged. Positive impacts of higher pricing (driven primarily by Greater China and North America), a unit volume increase and benefit from acquisitions were fully offset by unfavorable mix (due to the decline of the SK-II brand, which has higher than category-average selling prices) and unfavorable foreign exchange. The volume increase was primarily driven by growth in North America, Greater China (due to innovation) and Latin America, partially offset by a decline in Asia Pacific (due to increased pricing). Organic sales increased low single digits as a low teens increase in North America was partially offset by a low single-digit decrease in Greater China. Global market share of the Skin and Personal Care category increased more than a point. Net earnings decreased 1% to $1.9 billion due to the decrease in net sales, partially offset by a 10 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin increased as a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was mostly offset by a decrease in gross margin and an increase in effective tax rate. The gross margin reduction was driven by increased commodity and input material costs and negative product mix (due to the decline of the super-premium SK-II brand), partially offset by increased pricing. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to a decrease in marketing spending, partially offset by an increase in overhead spending. The higher effective tax rate was due to unfavorable geographic mix. Grooming Three months ended December 31, 2022 compared with three months ended December 31, 2021 Grooming net sales decreased 9% to $1.6 billion driven by unfavorable foreign exchange of 9%, a decrease in unit volume of 8% and unfavorable mix of 3% (due to disproportionate decline of Appliances, which has higher than segment-average selling prices), partially offset by higher pricing of 11% (primarily driven by Europe, North America and Latin America). The volume decline was driven primarily by Europe (due to market contraction and retailer inventory reductions of appliances), North America and Asia Pacific (both due to market contraction). Grooming organic sales were unchanged as a high teens increase in Latin America, a double digit increase in IMEA and a low single-digit increase in North America were fully offset by mid-single-digit decreases in Europe and Asia Pacific. Global market share of the Grooming segment increased 0.8 points. Net earnings decreased 15% to $404 million due to the decrease in net sales and a 170 basis-point decline in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin declined due to a decrease in gross margin and an increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. The gross margin decrease was driven by commodity and input material cost increases, unfavorable foreign exchange and negative product mix, partially offset by higher pricing and manufacturing cost savings. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased as the negative scale impacts of the net sales decrease and an increase in overhead spending were partially offset by a decrease in marketing spending. Six months ended December 31, 2022 compared with six months ended December 31, 2021 Grooming net sales decreased 7% to $3.3 billion driven by unfavorable foreign exchange of 9%, a 4% decrease in unit volume and unfavorable mix of 4% (due to decline of Appliances, which have higher than segment-average selling prices), partially offset by higher pricing of 10% (driven primarily by Europe, North America and Latin America). The volume decrease was primarily driven by decreases in Europe (due to portfolio reduction in Russia and market contraction) and North America (due to market contraction and increased pricing). Grooming organic sales increased 2% as high teens growth in Latin America, low teens growth in IMEA and a mid-single-digit growth in Asia Pacific were partially offset by a low single-digit decline in Europe.

Organic sales increased low single digits driven by mid-teen increases in Latin America and Asia Pacific and a low single-digit increase in North America, partially offset by a high single-digit decrease in Greater China. Global market share of the Oral Care category was unchanged. • Personal Health Care net sales increased low teens. Positive impacts of a favorable mix (due to the disproportionate volume growth of North America and respiratory products, both of which have higher than category-average selling prices), higher pricing (driven by North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific) and a volume increase were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. Volume increase was primarily driven by growth in North America due to a stronger respiratory season.

The gross margin increase was driven by higher pricing partially offset by an increase in commodity and input material costs and unfavorable foreign exchange. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased due to increased efficiencies in marketing spending and a reduction in overhead spending. The higher effective tax rate was driven by a higher proportion of net sales in North America, which has higher than Company-average tax rates.

Corporate Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business segments. These include but are not limited to incidental businesses managed at the corporate level, gains and losses related to certain divested brands or businesses, impacts from various financing and investing activities, impacts related to employee benefits, asset impairments and restructuring activities including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used within the reportable segments to U.S. GAAP. The most notable ongoing reconciling item is income taxes, which adjusts the blended statutory rates that are reflected in the reportable segments to the overall Company effective tax rate. Corporate net sales improved by $23 million to $175 million for the quarter and improved by $138 million to $428 million for the fiscal year to date, due to an increase in sales of incidental businesses managed at the corporate level. Corporate net earnings decreased $128 million to a loss of $61 million for the quarter as net sales growth of incidental businesses and a lower effective tax rate were more than offset by increased commodity costs tied to incidental businesses and higher foreign exchange transactional charges. For the fiscal year to date period, Corporate net earnings declined by $346 million to a loss of $107 million, as the net sales growth of incidental businesses and a lower effective tax rate were more than offset by increased commodity costs tied to the incidental businesses, prior period gain on the sale of real estate and higher foreign exchange transactional charges. LIQUIDITY & CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating Activities We generated $7.6 billion of cash from operating activities fiscal year to date, a decrease of $2.1 billion versus the prior year period. Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, deferred income taxes and gain on sale of assets), generated $9.1 billion of operating cash flow. Working capital and other impacts used $1.4 billion of cash in the period. Accounts receivable increased, using $654 million of cash, driven by sales growth across regions. Days sales outstanding increased by two days. Total inventories increased, consuming $655 million of cash driven by increased safety stock levels to strengthen supply chain sufficiency and increased commodity costs. Days on hand increased by four days. Accounts payable, accrued and other net operating assets and liabilities decreased, using $358 million of cash, primarily driven by post-retirement contributions and excess payments over accruals for salary and incentive compensation. This was partially offset by the impact of extended payment terms with suppliers. Days payable outstanding decreased by four days. Investing Activities Investing activities used $1.3 billion of cash fiscal year to date primarily driven by capital expenditures. Financing Activities Financing activities used $6.5 billion of net cash fiscal year to date. We used $6.0 billion for treasury stock purchases and $4.5 billion for dividends. We generated $3.6 billion from net debt increases and $437 million from the exercise of stock options and other impacts. As of December 31, 2022, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $16.9 billion. We have short- and long-term debt to meet our financing needs. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements. RECONCILIATION OF MEASURES NOT DEFINED BY U.S. GAAP In accordance with the SEC's Regulation S-K Item 10(e), the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measure. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful perspective on underlying business trends and provide a supplemental measure of period-to-period financial results. Disclosing these non-GAAP financial measures allows investors and management to view our operating results excluding the impact of items that are not reflective of the underlying operating performance. Management uses these non-GAAP measures in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. Certain of these measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures do not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. Therefore, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Organic sales growth: Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. This measure is used in assessing achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. Adjusted free cash flow: Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and adjusted for transitional tax payments resulting from the U.S. Tax Act beginning in 2019. Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. Management views adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments. Adjusted free cash flow productivity: Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings. Management views adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G’s ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. This measure is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. Core EPS: Core earnings per share, or Core EPS, is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share excluding items that are not judged to be part of the Company's sustainable results or trends. For the three and six months ended December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, there were no adjustments to or reconciling items for diluted net earnings per share. Management views this non-GAAP measure as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time. This measure is also used when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation.

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Basis of Presentation These statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of The Procter & Gamble Company and subsidiaries (the ""Company,"" ""Procter & Gamble,"" ""P&G,"" ""we"" or ""our"") contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods reported. However, the results of operations included in such financial statements may not necessarily be indicative of annual results. 2. New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies In November 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2021-10, ""Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance"". This guidance requires annual disclosures for transactions with a government authority that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution model. These amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted. We have completed our evaluation of significant transactions. The guidance has not had, and is not expected to have, a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. In September 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-04, ""Liabilities - Supplier Finance Programs (Subtopic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations"". This guidance requires annual and interim disclosures for entities that use supplier finance programs in connection with the purchase of goods and services. These amendments are effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, except for the amendment on rollforward information, which is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023. We are currently assessing the impact of this guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements. No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had, or is expected to have, a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 3. Segment Information Under U.S. GAAP, our operating segments are aggregated into five reportable segments: 1) Beauty, 2) Grooming, 3) Health Care, 4) Fabric & Home Care and 5) Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Our five reportable segments are comprised of: • Beauty : Hair Care (Conditioners, Shampoos, Styling Aids, Treatments); Skin and Personal Care (Antiperspirants and Deodorants, Personal Cleansing, Skin Care); • Grooming : Grooming (Appliances, Female Blades & Razors, Male Blades & Razors, Pre- and Post-Shave Products, Other Grooming); • Health Care : Oral Care (Toothbrushes, Toothpaste, Other Oral Care); Personal Health Care (Gastrointestinal, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements, Pain Relief, Other Personal Health Care); • Fabric & Home Care : Fabric Care (Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Additives, Laundry Detergents); Home Care (Air Care, Dish Care, P&G Professional, Surface Care); and • Baby, Feminine & Family Care : Baby Care (Baby Wipes, Taped Diapers and Pants); Feminine Care (Adult Incontinence, Feminine Care); Family Care (Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper). Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. Our operating segments are comprised of similar product categories. Operating segments that individually accounted for 5% or more of consolidated net sales are as follows: % of Net sales by operating segment (1) Three Months Ended September 30 2022 2021 Fabric Care 23 % 23 % Home Care 12 % 11 % Skin and Personal Care 10 % 10 % Baby Care 10 % 10 % Hair Care 9 % 10 % Family Care 8 % 8 % Grooming (2) 8 % 7 % Oral Care 8 % 8 % Feminine Care 6 % 6 % Personal Health Care 6 % 5 % Other — % 2 % Total 100 % 100 % (1) % of Net sales by operating segment excludes sales held in Corporate. (2) Effective July 1, 2022, the Grooming Sector Business Unit completed the full integration of its Shave Care and Appliances categories to cohesively serve consumers' grooming needs. This transition included the integration of the management team, strategic decision-making, innovation plans, financial targets, budgets and internal management reporting. For the three months ended September 30, 2021, Appliances was presented in Other. The following is a summary of reportable segment results: Three Months Ended September 30 Net Sales Earnings/(Loss) Before Income Taxes Net Earnings/(Loss) Beauty 2022 $ 3,961 $ 1,271 $ 1,011 2021 3,964 1,242 991 Grooming 2022 1,625 503 404 2021 1,687 518 417 Health Care 2022 2,757 800 617 2021 2,676 695 529 Fabric & Home Care 2022 7,082 1,543 1,172 2021 7,009 1,546 1,191 Baby, Feminine & Family Care 2022 4,934 1,055 805 2021 4,864 1,075 826 Corporate 2022 253 ( 175 ) ( 46 ) 2021 138 ( 41 ) 172 Total Company 2022 $ 20,612 $ 4,997 $ 3,963 2021 20,338 5,035 4,126 Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. 4. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill is allocated by reportable segment as follows: Beauty Grooming Health Care Fabric & Home Care Baby, Feminine & Family Care Total Company Goodwill at June 30, 2022 $ 13,296 $ 12,571 $ 7,589 $ 1,808 $ 4,436 $ 39,700 Acquisitions and divestitures — — — — — — Translation and other ( 344 ) ( 254 ) ( 217 ) ( 29 ) ( 95 ) ( 939 ) Goodwill at September 30, 2022 $ 12,952 $ 12,317 $ 7,372 $ 1,779 $ 4,341 $ 38,761 Goodwill decreased from June 30, 2022 primarily due to currency translation. Identifiable intangible assets at September 30, 2022 were comprised of: Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Intangible assets with determinable lives $ 8,890 $ ( 6,284 ) Intangible assets with indefinite lives 20,859 — Total identifiable intangible assets $ 29,749 $ ( 6,284 ) Intangible assets with determinable lives consist of brands, patents, technology and customer relationships. The intangible assets with indefinite lives primarily consist of brands. The amortization expense of determinable-lived intangible assets for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 was $ 80 and $ 77 , respectively. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment. We use the income method to estimate the fair value of these assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. If the resulting fair value is less than the asset's carrying value, that difference represents an impairment. Most of our goodwill reporting units have fair value cushions that significantly exceed their underlying carrying values. In connection with the Grooming operating segment integration as described further in Note 3, we concluded that the Shave Care and Appliances categories are one reporting unit (Grooming) for goodwill impairment testing. Based on our impairment testing performed in the prior fiscal year, goodwill for the Grooming reporting unit has a fair value cushion of over 40 %. Based on our impairment testing performed in the prior fiscal year, the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset's fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 5 % and is most susceptible to future impairment risk. Adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment, including foreign currency devaluation, increasing global inflation, market contraction from an economic recession and the Russia-Ukraine War, could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset and trigger a future impairment charge. The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the net sales growth rates (including residual growth rates), discount rate and royalty rates. Net sales growth rates could be negatively impacted by reductions or changes in demand for our Grooming products, which may be caused by, among other things: changes in the use and frequency of grooming products, by shifts in demand away from one or more of our higher priced products to lower priced products or potential supply chain constraints. In addition, relative global and country/regional macroeconomic factors, including the Russia-Ukraine War, could result in additional and prolonged devaluation of other countries' currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The residual growth rates represent the expected rate at which the Gillette brand is expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period. The residual growth rates utilized in our fair value estimates are consistent with the brand operating plans and approximate expected long-term category market growth rates. The residual growth rate depends on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, relative currency exchange rates and business activities that impact market share. As a result, the residual growth rate could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes, devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or an increased competitive environment. The discount rate, which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, such as further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar. Spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the U.S. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. The royalty rate used to determine the estimated fair value for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is driven by historical and estimated future profitability of the underlying Gillette business. The royalty rate may be impacted by significant adverse changes in long-term operating margins. We performed a sensitivity analysis for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset during our annual impairment testing from the prior year, utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the discount rate, the short-term and residual growth rates and the royalty rates to demonstrate the potential impacts to estimated fair values. The table below provides, in isolation, the estimated fair value impacts related to a 25 basis-point increase in the discount rate, a 25 basis-point decrease in our short-term and residual growth rates or a 50 basis-point decrease in our royalty rates, some of which would result in an impairment of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset. Approximate Percent Change in Estimated Fair Value +25 bps Discount Rate -25 bps Growth Rates -50 bps Royalty Rate Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset ( 6 )% ( 6 )% ( 3 )% Gillette's business results in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 exceeded the assumptions in our impairment testing from the prior year. However, during the three months ended September 30, 2022, the relative currency exchange rates devalued against the U.S. dollar and the inputs to the cost of capital determination increased. These macroeconomic changes place increased pressure on the fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset. Based on our assessment, we determined it is more likely than not that the fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset continues to exceed its carrying value of $ 14.1 billion as of September 30, 2022. Therefore, we have concluded that no triggering event has occurred in the current quarter. We will perform our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets during the three months ended December 31, 2022. 5. Earnings Per Share Basic net earnings per common share are calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble less preferred dividends by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net earnings per common share are calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble by the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The diluted shares include the dilutive effect of stock options and other stock-based awards based on the treasury stock method and the assumed conversion of preferred stock. Net earnings per share were calculated as follows: CONSOLIDATED AMOUNTS Three Months Ended September 30 2022 2021 Net earnings $ 3,963 $ 4,126 Less: Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 24 14 Net earnings attributable to P&G (Diluted) 3,939 4,112 Less: Preferred dividends 71 70 Net earnings attributable to P&G available to common shareholders (Basic) $ 3,868 $ 4,042 SHARES IN MILLIONS Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 2,385.5 2,428.1 Add: Effect of dilutive securities Convertible preferred shares (1) 77.4 80.5 Stock options and other unvested equity awards (2) 40.7 50.3 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 2,503.6 2,558.9 NET EARNINGS PER SHARE (3) Basic $ 1.62 $ 1.66 Diluted $ 1.57 $ 1.61 (1) An overview of preferred shares can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. (2) Excludes 18 million and 9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, of weighted average stock options outstanding because the exercise price of these options was greater than their average market value or their effect was antidilutive. (3) Net earnings per share are calculated on Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. 6. Share-Based Compensation and Postretirement Benefits The following table provides a summary of our share-based compensation expense and postretirement benefit impacts: Three Months Ended September 30 2022 2021 Share-based compensation expense $ 105 $ 116 Net periodic benefit cost for pension benefits 43 48 Net periodic benefit credit for other retiree benefits ( 132 ) ( 103 ) 7. Risk Management Activities and Fair Value Measurements As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. There have been no significant changes in our risk management policies or activities during the three months ended September 30, 2022. The Company has not changed its valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period. The Company recognizes transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of each quarter. There were no transfers between levels during the periods presented. Also, there was no significant activity within the Level 3 assets and liabilities during the periods presented. There were no significant assets or liabilities that were remeasured at fair value on a non-recurring basis for the three months ended September 30, 2022. Cash equivalents were $ 5.1 billion and $ 6.0 billion as of September 30, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively, and are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. Other investments had a fair value of $ 93 and $ 140 as of September 30, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively, including equity securities of $ 66 and $ 113 as of September 30, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively, and are presented in Other noncurrent assets. Investments are measured at fair value and primarily classified as Level 1 and Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Level 1 are based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets, and Level 2 are based on quoted market prices for similar instruments. There are no material investment balances classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy or using net asset value as a practical expedient. Unrealized gains on equity securities were $ 9 during the three months ended September 30, 2022. Unrealized losses on equity securities were $( 29 ) during the three months ended September 30, 2021. These unrealized gains/(losses) are recognized in Other non-operating income, net. The fair value of long-term debt was $ 21.8 billion and $ 25.7 billion as of September 30, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. This includes the current portion of long-term debt instruments ($ 2.2 billion and $ 3.6 billion as of September 30, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively). Certain long-term debt (debt designated as a fair value hedge) is recorded at fair value. All other long-term debt is recorded at amortized cost but is measured at fair value for disclosure purposes. We consider our debt to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Fair values are generally estimated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments. Disclosures about Financial Instruments The notional amounts and fair values of financial instruments used in hedging transactions as of September 30, 2022 and June 30, 2022 are as follows: Notional Amount Fair Value Asset Fair Value (Liability) September 30, 2022 June 30, 2022 September 30, 2022 June 30, 2022 September 30, 2022 June 30, 2022 DERIVATIVES IN FAIR VALUE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Interest rate contracts $ 3,743 $ 4,972 $ — $ 3 $ ( 435 ) $ ( 307 ) DERIVATIVES IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Foreign currency interest rate contracts $ 11,877 $ 7,943 $ 877 $ 561 $ ( 9 ) $ ( 1 ) TOTAL DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS $ 15,620 $ 12,915 $ 877 $ 564 $ ( 444 ) $ ( 308 ) DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS Foreign currency contracts $ 4,108 $ 5,625 $ 4 $ 6 $ ( 96 ) $ ( 61 ) TOTAL DERIVATIVES AT FAIR VALUE $ 19,728 $ 18,540 $ 881 $ 570 $ ( 540 ) $ ( 369 ) Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. The fair value of the interest rate derivative asset/(liability) directly offsets the cumulative amount of the fair value hedging adjustment included in the carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation. The carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation, which includes the unamortized discount or premium and the fair value adjustment, was $ 3.3 billion and $ 4.7 billion as of September 30, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges. The carrying value of those debt instruments designated as net investment hedges, which includes the adjustment for the foreign currency transaction gain or loss on those instruments, was $ 9.4 billion and $ 11.2 billion as of September 30, 2022 and June 30, 2022, respectively. The increase in the notional balance of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges is partially offset by the decrease in debt designated as a net investment hedge due to maturities. The net increase in the total amount of instruments designated as net investment hedges is primarily driven by the Company's decision to leverage favorable interest rate spreads in the foreign currency swap market. All derivative assets are presented in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Other noncurrent assets. All derivative liabilities are presented in Accrued and other liabilities or Other noncurrent liabilities. Changes in the fair value of net investment hedges are recognized in the Foreign currency translation component of Other comprehensive income (OCI). All of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Before tax gains on our financial instruments in hedging relationships are categorized as follows: Amount of Gain Recognized in OCI on Derivatives Three Months Ended September 30 2022 2021 DERIVATIVES IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS (1) (2) Foreign exchange contracts $ 708 $ 208 (1) For the derivatives in net investment hedging relationships, the amount of gain excluded from effectiveness testing, which was recognized in earnings, was $ 46 and $ 15 for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. (2) In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges. The amount of gain recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) for such instruments was $ 698 and $ 303 for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Amount of Loss Recognized in Earnings Three Months Ended September 30 2022 2021 DERIVATIVES IN FAIR VALUE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Interest rate contracts $ ( 131 ) $ ( 36 ) DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS Foreign currency contracts $ ( 146 ) $ ( 24 ) The loss on the derivatives in fair value hedging relationships is fully offset by the mark-to-market impact of the related exposure. These are both recognized in Interest expense. The loss on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is substantially offset by the currency mark-to-market of the related exposure. These are both recognized in Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A). Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. 8. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss) The table below presents the changes in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) attributable to Procter & Gamble (AOCI), including the reclassifications out of AOCI by component: Investment Securities Post-retirement Benefit Plans Foreign Currency Translation Total AOCI Balance at June 30, 2022 $ 20 $ 27 $ ( 12,236 ) $ ( 12,189 ) OCI before reclassifications (1) ( 2 ) 82 ( 712 ) ( 632 ) Amounts reclassified to the Consolidated Statement of Earnings (2) — 5 — 5 Net current period OCI ( 2 ) 87 ( 712 ) ( 627 ) Less: OCI attributable to non-controlling interests — — ( 5 ) ( 5 ) Balance at September 30, 2022 $ 18 $ 114 $ ( 12,943 ) $ ( 12,811 ) (1) Net of tax (benefit)/expense of $( 1 ), $ 9 and $ 330 for gains/losses on investment securities, postretirement benefit plans and foreign currency translation, respectively. Income tax effects within foreign currency translation include impacts from items such as net investment hedge transactions. (2) Net of tax expense of $ 0 , $ 2 and $ 0 for gains/losses on investment securities, postretirement benefit plans and foreign currency translation, respectively. The below provides additional details on amounts reclassified from AOCI into the Consolidated Statements of Earnings: • Investment securities: amounts reclassified from AOCI into Other non-operating income, net. • Postretirement benefits: amounts reclassified from AOCI into Other non-operating income, net and included in the computation of net periodic postretirement costs. 9. Commitments and Contingencies Litigation We are subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental, patent and trademark matters, labor and employment matters and tax. While considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management and our counsel, the ultimate resolution of the various lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior manufacturing and waste disposal practices. Based on currently available information, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of environmental remediation will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Income Tax Uncertainties The Company is present in approximately 70 countries and over 150 taxable jurisdictions and, at any point in time, has 40 – 50 jurisdictional audits underway at various stages of completion. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite our belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitations. Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate. We have tax years open ranging from 2010 and forward. We are generally not able to reliably estimate the ultimate settlement amounts until the close of an audit. Based on information currently available, we anticipate that over the next 12 month period, audit activity could be completed related to uncertain tax positions in multiple jurisdictions for which we have accrued existing liabilities of approximately $ 12 , including interest and penalties. Additional information on the Commitments and Contingencies of the Company can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. Item 2.

Purpose, Approach and Non-GAAP Measures The purpose of Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is to provide an understanding of Procter & Gamble's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. The MD&A is organized into the following sections: • Overview • Summary of Results – Three months ended September 30, 2022 • Economic Conditions and Uncertainties • Results of Operations – Three months ended September 30, 2022 • Business Segment Discussion – Three months ended September 30, 2022 • Liquidity and Capital Resources • Reconciliation of Measures Not Defined by U.S. GAAP Throughout the MD&A, we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales, net earnings, diluted net earnings per share and operating cash flow. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) that include organic sales growth, core net earnings per share (Core EPS), adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity. The explanation at the end of the MD&A provides the definition of these non-GAAP measures, details on the use and the derivation of these measures, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition, despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and market consumption in the MD&A are based on a combination of vendor purchased traditional brick-and-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales of our products in dollar terms on a constant currency basis relative to all product sales in the category. The Company measures fiscal year to date market shares through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months as compared to the end of the reporting period. Management also uses unit volume growth to evaluate and explain drivers of changes in net sales. Organic volume growth reflects year-over-year changes in unit volume excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and certain one-time items, if applicable, and is used to explain changes in organic sales. OVERVIEW P&G is a global leader in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world. Our products are sold in approximately 180 countries and territories, primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores and professional channels. We also sell direct to individual consumers. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries. Our market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We believe we are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position. The table below lists our reportable segments, including the product categories and brand composition within each segment. Reportable Segments Product Categories (Sub-Categories) Major Brands Beauty Hair Care ( Conditioners, Shampoos, Styling Aids, Treatments ) Head & Shoulders, Herbal Essences, Pantene, Rejoice Skin and Personal Care ( Antiperspirants and Deodorants, Personal Cleansing, Skin Care ) Olay, Old Spice, Safeguard, Secret, SK-II Grooming (1) Grooming ( Appliances, Female Blades & Razors, Male Blades & Razors, Pre- and Post-Shave Products, Other Grooming ) Braun, Gillette, Venus Health Care Oral Care ( Toothbrushes, Toothpastes, Other Oral Care ) Crest, Oral-B Personal Health Care ( Gastrointestinal, Pain Relief, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements, Other Personal Health Care ) Metamucil, Neurobion, Pepto-Bismol, Vicks Fabric & Home Care Fabric Care ( Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Additives, Laundry Detergents ) Ariel, Downy, Gain, Tide Home Care ( Air Care, Dish Care, P&G Professional, Surface Care ) Cascade, Dawn, Fairy, Febreze, Mr. Clean, Swiffer Baby, Feminine & Family Care Baby Care ( Baby Wipes, Taped Diapers and Pants ) Luvs, Pampers Feminine Care ( Adult Incontinence, Feminine Care ) Always, Always Discreet, Tampax Family Care ( Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper ) Bounty, Charmin, Puffs (1) Effective July 1, 2022, the Grooming Sector Business Unit completed the full integration of its Shave Care and Appliances categories to cohesively serve consumers' grooming needs. This transition included the integration of the management team, strategic decision-making, innovation plans, financial targets, budgets and internal management reporting. The following table provides the percentage of net sales and net earnings by reportable business segment (excluding Corporate) for the three months ended September 30, 2022: Three Months Ended September 30, 2022 Net Sales Net Earnings Beauty 19% 25% Grooming 8% 10% Health Care 14% 16% Fabric & Home Care 35% 29% Baby, Feminine & Family Care 24% 20% Total Company 100% 100% SUMMARY OF RESULTS The following are highlights of results for the three months ended September 30, 2022 versus the three months ended September 30, 2021: • Net sales increased 1% to $20.6 billion. Growth was driven by low single-digit increases in Health Care, Fabric & Home Care and Baby, Feminine & Family Care, partially offset by a mid-single-digit decrease in Grooming. Net Sales in Beauty were unchanged. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, increased 7%. Organic sales increased high single digits in Health Care and Fabric & Home Care and increased mid-single digits in Beauty, Grooming and Baby, Feminine & Family Care. • Net earnings were $4.0 billion, a decrease of $163 million, or 4%, versus the prior year period due to a decrease in operating margin, partially offset by the increase in net sales. • Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble were $3.9 billion, a decrease of $173 million, or 4%, versus the prior year. • Diluted net earnings per share (EPS) decreased 2% to $1.57 due primarily to the decrease in net earnings, partially offset by a reduction in the weighted average shares outstanding. • Operating cash flow was $4.1 billion. Adjusted free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less capital expenditures and certain other impacts, was $3.4 billion. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 86%. ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES Global Economic Conditions. Our products are sold in numerous countries across North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa, with more than half our sales generated outside the United States. As such, we are exposed to and impacted by global macroeconomic factors, U.S. and foreign government policies and foreign exchange fluctuations. Current macroeconomic factors remain very dynamic, and any causes of market size contraction, such as COVID-19 related disruptions or lockdowns, greater political unrest or instability in the Middle East, Central and Eastern Europe (including the ongoing Russia-Ukraine War), certain Latin American markets and the Korean peninsula could reduce our sales or erode our operating margin and consequently reduce our net earnings and cash flows. Changes in Costs. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity and input material prices, transportation costs, broader inflationary impacts and our own productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities and input materials, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp. Volatility in the market price of these commodities and input materials has a direct impact on our costs. Disruptions in our manufacturing, supply and distribution operations, including due to COVID-19 related lockdowns, energy shortages, port congestions, labor constraints and freight container and truck shortages have impacted our costs and could do so in the future. If we are unable to manage these impacts through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions, as well as through consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. Net sales could also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on the consumption of our products. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. If we are not successful in executing and sustaining these changes, there could be a negative impact on our gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. Foreign Exchange. We have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates. Translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation of transaction-related working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. Historically, weakening of certain foreign currencies versus the U.S. dollar have resulted in significant foreign exchange impacts leading to lower net sales, net earnings and cash flows. Certain countries experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations such as Argentina, Brazil, United Kingdom, Japan, Russia and Turkey have had, and could continue to have, a significant impact on our net sales, net earnings and cash flows. Increased pricing in response to certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could also have a negative impact on the consumption of our products, which would negatively affect our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. Government Policies. Our net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government legislative, regulatory or enforcement policies. On August 16, 2022, the ""Inflation Reduction Act"" (H.R. 5376) was signed into law in the United States. We do not currently expect the Inflation Reduction Act to have a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. Our net earnings and cash flows could be affected by any future legislative or regulatory changes in U.S. or non-U.S. tax policy, or any significant change in global tax policy adopted under the current work being led by the OECD for the G20 focused on ""Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy"". Our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows may also be impacted by changes in U.S. and foreign government policies related to environmental and climate change matters. Additionally, we attempt to carefully manage our debt, currency and other exposures in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and pricing controls, such as Argentina, Egypt, Nigeria and Pakistan. Further, our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes to international trade agreements in North America and elsewhere. Changes in government policies in these areas might cause an increase or decrease in our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. Russia-Ukraine War. The war between Russia and Ukraine has negatively impacted our operations in both countries. Our Ukraine business includes two manufacturing sites. We have approximately 500 employees including both manufacturing and non-manufacturing personnel. Our operations in Ukraine accounted for less than 1% of consolidated net sales and net earnings in fiscal 2022. Additionally, net assets of our Ukraine subsidiary, along with Ukraine related assets held by other subsidiaries, account for less than 1% of net assets as of September 30, 2022. Our Russia business includes two manufacturing sites with a net book value of approximately $300 million as of September 30, 2022. We have approximately 1,800 employees, including both manufacturing and non-manufacturing personnel. In fiscal 2022, our operations in Russia accounted for less than 2% of consolidated net sales and less than 1% of net earnings. Additionally, net assets of our Russia subsidiaries, along with Russia related assets held by other subsidiaries, account for less than 2% of net assets as of September 30, 2022. Beginning in March 2022, the Company reduced its product portfolio, discontinued new capital investments and suspended media, advertising and promotional activity in Russia. Future impacts to the Company are difficult to predict due to the high level of uncertainty related to the war’s duration, evolution and resolution. Within Ukraine, there is a possibility of physical damage and destruction of our two manufacturing facilities. We may not be able to operate our manufacturing sites and source raw materials from our suppliers or ship finished products to our customers. Ultimately, these could result in impairments of our manufacturing plants and fixed assets or write-downs of other operating assets and working capital. Within Russia, we may not be able to continue our reduced operations at current levels due to sanctions and counter-sanctions, monetary, currency or payment controls, legislative restrictions or policies, restrictions on access to financial institutions and supply and transportation challenges. Our suppliers, distributors and retail customers are also impacted by the war and their ability to successfully maintain their operations could also impact our operations or negatively impact the sales of our products. More broadly, there could be additional negative impacts to our net sales, earnings and cash flows should the situation escalate beyond its current scope, including, among other potential impacts, economic recessions in certain neighboring countries or globally due to inflationary pressures and supply chain cost increases or the geographic proximity of the war relative to the rest of Europe. For a more complete discussion of the risks we encounter in our business, please refer to Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Three Months Ended September 30, 2022 The following discussion provides a review of results for the three months ended September 30, 2022 versus the three months ended September 30, 2021. Three Months Ended September 30 Amounts in millions, except per share amounts 2022 2021 % Chg Net sales $20,612 $20,338 1% Operating income 4,939 5,023 (2)% Net earnings 3,963 4,126 (4)% Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 3,939 4,112 (4)% Diluted net earnings per common share 1.57 1.61 (2)% Three Months Ended September 30 COMPARISONS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES 2022 2021 Basis Pt Chg Gross margin 47.4% 49.0% (160) Selling, general & administrative expense 23.4% 24.3% (90) Operating income 24.0% 24.7% (70) Earnings before income taxes 24.2% 24.8% (60) Net earnings 19.2% 20.3% (110) Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 19.1% 20.2% (110) Net Sales Net sales for the quarter increased 1% to $20.6 billion. The increase in net sales was due to higher pricing of 9% and favorable mix of 1%, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange of 6% and a decrease in unit volume of 3%. Favorable mix was driven by the growth of the Skin & Personal Care and Personal Health Care businesses (both of which have higher than Company-average selling prices). Organic sales increased 7% on a 3% decrease in organic volume. Net Sales increased low single digits in Health Care, Fabric & Home Care and Baby, Feminine & Family Care and decreased mid-single digits in Grooming. Net Sales in Beauty were unchanged. On a regional basis, volume decreased high single digits in Europe and decreased low single digits in North America and Greater China. These volume decreases were partially offset by a high single-digit increase in Latin America and low single-digit increases in Asia Pacific and IMEA. Net Sales Change Drivers 2022 vs. 2021 (Three Months Ended September 30, 2022) (1) Volume with Acquisitions & Divestitures Volume Excluding Acquisitions & Divestitures Foreign Exchange Price Mix Other (2) Net Sales Growth Beauty (1)% (1)% (6)% 7% (2)% 2% —% Grooming —% 1% (8)% 8% (4)% —% (4)% Health Care (2)% (2)% (5)% 6% 4% —% 3% Fabric & Home Care (4)% (4)% (6)% 11% 1% (1)% 1% Baby, Feminine & Family Care (3)% (3)% (5)% 8% 1% —% 1% Total Company (3)% (3)% (6)% 9% 1% —% 1% (1) Net sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied. (2) Other includes the sales mix impact from acquisitions and divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile volume to net sales. Operating Costs Gross margin decreased 160 basis points to 47.4% of net sales for the quarter. The decrease in gross margin was due to: • 510 basis points of increased commodity and input material costs, • a 120 basis-point decline from unfavorable product mix, primarily due to the disproportionate slowdown of SK-II, Appliances and Fabric Enhancers products, all of which have higher than company-average gross margins, • 40 basis points of increased transportation costs, • 30 basis points of product and packaging investments, • a 30 basis-point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange impacts and • a 10 basis-point decline from decreased cost leverage. These impacts were partially offset by • a 470 basis-point increase due to higher pricing and • 110 basis points of manufacturing productivity savings. Total SG&A spending decreased 2% to $4.8 billion due to decreased marketing spending partially offset by increased overhead costs and other operating costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 90 basis points to 23.4% due primarily to a decrease in marketing spending as a percentage of sales, partially offset by an increase in overhead and other operating costs as a percentage of sales. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 200 basis points due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase, increased savings in promotion-related and agency costs and lower media spending. Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales increased 30 basis points due to inflation and other cost increases, partially offset by the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase. Other operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 80 basis points due to a prior period gain on the sale of real estate and higher foreign exchange transactional charges. Productivity-driven cost savings delivered 120 basis points of benefit to SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Non-Operating Expenses and Income Interest expense was $123 million for the quarter, a $14 million increase versus the prior year period. Interest income was $42 million for the quarter, a $31 million increase versus the prior year period due to higher interest rates. Other non-operating income was $139 million, an increase of $29 million primarily due to a prior period unrealized loss on equity investments. Income Taxes For the three months ended September 30, 2022, the effective tax rate increased 260 basis points to 20.7% due to: • a 130 basis-point increase from lower excess tax benefits of share-based compensation (a 60 basis-point benefit in the current period versus a 190 basis-point benefit in the prior year period), • a 70 basis-point increase from discrete impacts related to uncertain tax positions (a 20 basis-point unfavorable impact in the current period versus a 50 basis-point favorable impact in the prior year period), and • a 60 basis-point increase from unfavorable impacts from the geographic mix of current year earnings. Net Earnings Operating income decreased $84 million, or 2%, to $4.9 billion for the quarter, as the increase in net sales was more than fully offset by the decrease in operating margin, the components of which are described above. Net earnings decreased $163 million, or 4%, to $4.0 billion as the decrease in operating income and an increase in effective tax rate were partially offset by an increase in other non-operating income. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of approximately $381 million on net earnings for the quarter, including both transactional and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars. Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble decreased $173 million, or 4%, to $3.9 billion for the quarter. Diluted net earnings per share decreased 2% to $1.57 versus the prior year period due to the decrease in net earnings, partially offset by a reduction in the weighted average number of shares outstanding. BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSION – Three Months Ended September 30, 2022 The following discussion provides a review of results by reportable business segment. Analysis of the results for the three month period ended September 30, 2022 is provided based on a comparison to the three month period ended September 30, 2021. The primary financial measures used to evaluate segment performance are net sales and net earnings. The table below provides supplemental information on net sales, earnings before income taxes and net earnings by reportable business segment for the three months ended September 30, 2022 versus the comparable prior year period (dollar amounts in millions): Three Months Ended September 30, 2022 Net Sales % Change Versus Year Ago Earnings/(Loss) Before Income Taxes % Change Versus Year Ago Net Earnings/(Loss) % Change Versus Year Ago Beauty $ 3,961 — % $ 1,271 2 % $ 1,011 2 % Grooming 1,625 (4) % 503 (3) % 404 (3) % Health Care 2,757 3 % 800 15 % 617 17 % Fabric & Home Care 7,082 1 % 1,543 — % 1,172 (2) % Baby, Feminine & Family Care 4,934 1 % 1,055 (2) % 805 (3) % Corporate 253 N/A (175) N/A (46) N/A Total Company $ 20,612 1 % $ 4,997 (1) % $ 3,963 (4) % Beauty Three months ended September 30, 2022 compared with three months ended September 30, 2021 Beauty net sales were unchanged at $4.0 billion, as the positive impact from higher pricing of 7% and from acquisitions of 2% was fully offset by unfavorable foreign exchange of 6%, unfavorable mix of 2% (due primarily to the decline of SK-II brand, which has higher than segment-average selling prices) and a decrease in unit volume of 1%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and foreign exchange, organic sales increased 4%. Global market share of the Beauty segment increased 0.5 points. • Hair Care net sales decreased low single digits. Negative impacts of a decrease in unit volume and unfavorable foreign exchange were partially offset by higher pricing (in all regions). The volume decrease was driven primarily by declines in Europe (due to portfolio reduction in Russia), Greater China (related to market contraction) and North America (due to market contraction and increased pricing). Organic sales increased mid-single digits driven by a double-digit growth in Latin America and Europe, a high single-digit growth in IMEA and a mid-single-digit growth in North America, partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in Greater China. Global market share of the Hair Care category decreased a point. • Skin and Personal Care net sales increased low single digits. Positive impacts of a volume increase, higher pricing and a benefit from acquisitions were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange and unfavorable mix (due to the decline of SK-II brand, which has higher than category-average selling prices). Volume increase was primarily driven by growth in North America (due to innovation) and Latin America, partially offset by a decline in Greater China (due to pandemic-related lockdowns) and Asia Pacific. Organic sales increased mid-single digits as a mid-teens increase in North America was partially offset by a low single-digit decrease in Greater China. Global market share of the Skin and Personal Care category increased more than a point. Net earnings increased 2% to $1.0 billion due to a 50 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin increased due to a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by a decrease in gross margin. The gross margin reduction was driven by increased commodity and input material costs, transportation costs and negative product mix due to the decline of the super-premium SK-II brand, partially offset by increased pricing. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to a decrease in marketing spending. Grooming Three months ended September 30, 2022 compared with three months ended September 30, 2021 Grooming net sales decreased 4% to $1.6 billion driven by unfavorable foreign exchange of 8% and unfavorable mix of 4% (due to decline of Appliances, which have higher than segment-average selling prices), partially offset by higher pricing of 8% (driven by Europe, North America, Latin America and Asia Pacific). Unit volume was unchanged as increases in Asia Pacific, Europe and IMEA were fully offset by a decline in North America (as a result of increased pricing) and a minor divestiture. Grooming organic sales increased 5% on a 1% increase in organic volume. Organic sales increased more than 20% in Asia Pacific, high teens in Latin America, mid-teens in IMEA and low single digits in Europe. This was partially offset by a low single-digit decline in North America. Global market share of the Grooming segment increased 0.7 points. Net earnings decreased 3% to $404 million due to the decrease in net sales. Net earnings margin was unchanged as a decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was mostly offset by a higher effective tax rate. The gross margin remained unchanged as increases due to higher pricing and manufacturing cost savings were fully offset by decreases due to commodity and input material cost increases, unfavorable foreign exchange and negative geographic mix caused by the disproportionate volume growth of Latin America and Asia Pacific (which have lower than segment-average gross margins). SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased as increased efficiencies in marketing spending were partially offset by the negative scale impacts of the net sales decrease. The higher effective tax rate was driven by a higher proportion of net sales in North America, which has higher than Company-average tax rates. Health Care Three months ended September 30, 2022 compared with three months ended September 30, 2021 Health Care net sales increased 3% to $2.8 billion driven by higher pricing of 6% and favorable mix of 4% (due to volume growth in North America and the Personal Health Care category, both of which have higher than segment-average selling prices), partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange of 5% and a decrease in unit volume of 2%. Organic sales increased 8%. Global market share of the Health Care segment decreased 0.7 points. • Oral Care net sales decreased low single digits. Negative impacts of a volume decline and unfavorable foreign exchange were partially offset by increased pricing and favorable product mix (driven by the growth of power brush and premium paste products, both of which have higher than category-average selling prices). Volume decline was primarily driven by North America (due to market contraction and increased pricing), Europe (due to portfolio reduction in Russia and increased pricing), Greater China (due to market contraction) and IMEA, partially offset by growth in Latin America. Organic sales increased low single digits driven by an increase of about 20% in Latin America and low single digits in North America, partially offset by low single-digit decreases in Europe and Greater China. Global market share of the Oral Care category decreased slightly. • Personal Health Care net sales increased double digits. Positive impacts of a volume increase, higher pricing (driven primarily by North America and Latin America) and favorable mix (due to the disproportionate volume growth of North America and respiratory products, both of which have higher than category-average selling prices) were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. Volume increase was driven by growth in North America and Europe (both due to a stronger respiratory season), partially offset by a decline in IMEA (versus a base period impacted by pandemic-related consumption increases in certain markets). Organic sales increased high teens driven by growth in all regions led by a more than 20% growth in North America, about 20% growth in Europe and double-digit growth in Latin America. Global market share of the Personal Health Care category decreased more than half a point. Net earnings increased 17% to $617 million due to the increase in net sales and a 260 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin increased due primarily to a decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales and a slight increase in gross margin . The increase in gross margin was driven by increased pricing and favorable mix (caused by the disproportionate growth of respiratory products that have higher than segment-average gross margins), mostly offset by increased commodity and input material costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and higher efficiencies in marketing spending. Fabric & Home Care Three months ended September 30, 2022 compared with three months ended September 30, 2021 Fabric & Home Care net sales increased 1% to $7.1 billion driven by higher pricing of 11% and favorable mix of 1% (due to a disproportionate volume decline in Europe, which has lower than segment-average selling prices), partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange of 6% and a decrease in unit volume of 4%. Organic sales increased 8%. Global market share of the Fabric & Home Care segment was unchanged. • Fabric Care net sales increased low single digits. Positive impacts of higher pricing (driven primarily by North America, Europe and Latin America) and favorable mix (due to a volume decline in Europe, which has lower than category-average selling prices) were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange and a decrease in unit volume. The volume decrease was primarily driven by declines in Europe (due to portfolio reduction in Russia and increased pricing) and North America (due to market contraction) partially offset by growth in Asia Pacific, Latin America and IMEA. Organic sales increased high single digits driven by a more than 30% growth in Latin America, more than 20% growth in IMEA, mid-teens growth in Asia Pacific, mid-single digit growth in North America and low single-digit growth in Europe. Global market share of the Fabric Care category decreased less than a point. • Home Care net sales were unchanged. Positive impacts of higher pricing (driven primarily by Europe and North America) and favorable mix (due to a volume decline in Europe, which has lower than category-average selling prices) were fully offset by unfavorable foreign exchange and a decrease in unit volume. The volume decrease was driven by declines in Europe and North America, both due to market contraction versus a high base period of increased consumption of cleaning products. Organic sales increased high single digits driven by about 40% growth in Latin America, double-digit growth in Europe and mid-single-digit growth in North America. Global market share of the Home Care category increased a point. Net earnings decreased 2% to $1.2 billion as the increase in net sales was more than offset by a 50 basis-point reduction in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin decreased due primarily to a reduction in gross margin, partially offset by a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. The gross margin decrease was driven by an increase in commodity and input material costs, transportation costs, unfavorable foreign exchange and negative product mix (due to decline of fabric enhancers that have higher than segment-average gross margins), partially offset by increased pricing. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased due to the positive scale benefits of the net sales increase and increased efficiencies in marketing spending. Baby, Feminine & Family Care Three months ended September 30, 2022 compared with three months ended September 30, 2021 Baby, Feminine & Family Care net sales increased 1% to $4.9 billion driven by higher pricing of 8% and favorable product and geographic mix of 1%, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange of 5% and a decrease in unit volume of 3%. Organic sales increased 6%. Global market share of the Baby, Feminine & Family Care segment was unchanged. • Baby Care net sales decreased low single digits. Negative impacts of a decrease in unit volume and unfavorable foreign exchange were partially offset by higher pricing (driven primarily by Europe, North America and Latin America) and favorable product mix (due to a higher proportion of pants, which have higher than category-average selling prices). The volume decrease was driven by declines in Europe (due primarily to portfolio reduction in Russia), North America and Greater China (due to market contraction), partially offset by growth in Latin America and IMEA. Organic sales increased mid-single digits driven by more than 30% growth in Latin America, low teens growth in IMEA, mid-single-digit growth in North America and low single-digit growth in Europe, partially offset by high single-digit decline in Greater China. Global market share of the Baby Care category increased more than half a point. • Feminine Care net sales increased mid-single digits. Positive impacts of higher pricing (driven primarily by North America and Europe) and favorable mix (due to volume decline in Europe, which has lower than category-average selling prices) were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange and a decrease in unit volume. The volume decrease was driven by declines in Europe (due to portfolio reduction in Russia), North America (due to supply constraints) and IMEA (due to increased pricing in certain markets), partially offset by growth in Latin America. Organic sales increased double digits driven by growth in all regions led by a more than 30% increase in Latin America, mid-teens increase in Europe and double-digit increases in North America and Asia Pacific. Global market share of the Feminine Care category increased half a point. • Net sales in Family Care, which is predominantly a North America business, increased low single digits driven by higher pricing, partially offset by a decrease in unit volume (due to market contraction and increased competitive activity). Organic sales also increased low single digits. North America share of the Family Care category decreased more than a point. Net earnings decreased 3% to $805 million as the increase in net sales was more than offset by a 70 basis-point decrease in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin decreased primarily due to a decrease in gross margin, partially offset by lower SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin decreased primarily due to an increase in commodity and input material costs and transportation costs, partially offset by increased pricing. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased due to the positive scale benefits of the net sales increase and increased efficiencies in marketing spending. Corporate Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business segments. These include but are not limited to incidental businesses managed at the corporate level, gains and losses related to certain divested brands or businesses, impacts from various financing and investing activities, impacts related to employee benefits, asset impairments and restructuring activities including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used within the reportable segments to U.S. GAAP. The most notable ongoing reconciling item is income taxes, which adjusts the blended statutory rates that are reflected in the reportable segments to the overall Company effective tax rate. Corporate net sales improved by $115 million to $253 million, due to an increase in sales of incidental businesses managed at the corporate level. Corporate net earnings decreased $218 million to a loss of $46 million as the benefit of the net sales growth was more than offset by higher foreign exchange transactional charges, lower current period tax benefits (primarily lower excess tax benefits of share-based compensation), prior period gain on the sale of real estate and increased commodity costs tied to the aforementioned incidental businesses. LIQUIDITY & CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating Activities We generated $4.1 billion of cash from operating activities fiscal year to date, a decrease of $573 million versus the prior year period. Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, deferred income taxes and gain on sale of assets), generated $4.6 billion of operating cash flow. Working capital and other impacts used $530 million of cash in the period. Accounts receivable increased, using $740 million of cash, driven by sales growth across regions. Days sales outstanding increased by two days. Total inventories increased, consuming $893 million of cash driven by increased safety stock levels to strengthen supply chain sufficiency amidst business growth and increased commodity costs. Days on hand increased by four days. Accounts payable, accrued and other net operating assets and liabilities increased, generating $1.0 billion of cash, driven by higher trade payables from an increase in supply chain activities and current year tax accruals in excess of estimated payments. This is partially offset by the payment of prior fiscal year-end incentive compensation and other salary-related accruals. Days payable outstanding increased by one day. Investing Activities Investing activities used $832 million of cash fiscal year to date primarily driven by capital expenditures. Financing Activities Financing activities used $3.5 billion of net cash fiscal year to date. We used $4.0 billion for treasury stock purchases and $2.3 billion for dividends. We generated $2.6 billion from net debt increases and $188 million from the exercise of stock options and other impacts. As of September 30, 2022, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $14.1 billion. We have short- and long-term debt to meet our financing needs. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements. RECONCILIATION OF MEASURES NOT DEFINED BY U.S. GAAP In accordance with the SEC's Regulation S-K Item 10(e), the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measure. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful perspective on underlying business trends and provide a supplemental measure of period-to-period financial results. Disclosing these non-GAAP financial measures allows investors and management to view our operating results excluding the impact of items that are not reflective of the underlying operating performance. Management uses these non-GAAP measures in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. Certain of these measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures do not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. Therefore, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Organic sales growth: Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. This measure is used in assessing achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. Adjusted free cash flow: Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and transitional tax payments resulting from the U.S. Tax Act beginning in 2019. Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. Management views adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments. Adjusted free cash flow productivity: Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings. Management views adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G’s ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. This measure is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. Core EPS: Core earnings per share, or Core EPS, is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share excluding items that are not judged to be part of the Company's sustainable results or trends. For the three months ended September 30, 2022 and September 30, 2021, there were no adjustments to or reconciling items for diluted net earnings per share. Management views this non-GAAP measure as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time. This measure is also used when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation.

Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company’s fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings The Company is subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental issues, patent and trademark matters, labor and employment matters and tax. In addition, SEC regulations require that we disclose certain environmental proceedings arising under Federal, State or local law when a governmental authority is a party and such proceeding involves potential monetary sanctions that the Company reasonably believes will exceed a certain threshold ($1 million or more). There are no relevant matters to disclose under this Item for this period. Item 1A.

See accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Basis of Presentation These statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of The Procter & Gamble Company and subsidiaries (the ""Company,"" ""Procter & Gamble,"" ""P&G,"" ""we"" or ""our"") contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods reported. However, the results of operations included in such financial statements may not necessarily be indicative of annual results. Beginning in fiscal year 2022, the Company began to present increases and reductions in short-term debt with maturities of more than three months separately within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The presentation for the nine months ended March 31, 2021 has been revised to align with the current period presentation. This change had no impact on total financing activities, and we have concluded the change is not material. 2. New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") No. 2020-04, ""Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting"". The amendments provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-01, ""Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope"", which clarified that certain optional expedients and exceptions in Topic 848 apply to derivative instruments that are affected by the discounting transition due to reference rate reform. These ASUs were effective upon issuance and may be applied prospectively to contract modifications and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated through December 31, 2022. We have completed our evaluation of significant contracts. Most contracts reviewed will mature prior to the termination of LIBOR or will be modified to apply a new reference rate, primarily the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (""SOFR"") where applicable. As a result, the guidance has not had, and is not expected to have, a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, ""Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance"". This guidance requires annual disclosures for transactions with a government authority that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution model. These amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted. We plan to adopt the standard for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023. We are currently assessing the impact of this guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosures. No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had, or is expected to have, a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 3. Segment Information Under U.S. GAAP, our operating segments are aggregated into five reportable segments: 1) Beauty, 2) Grooming, 3) Health Care, 4) Fabric & Home Care and 5) Baby, Feminine & Family Care.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill is allocated by reportable segment as follows: Beauty Grooming Health Care Fabric & Home Care Baby, Feminine & Family Care Total Company Goodwill at June 30, 2021 $ 13,257 $ 13,095 $ 8,046 $ 1,873 $ 4,653 $ 40,924 Acquisitions and divestitures 770 — 1 — — 771 Translation and other ( 368 ) ( 257 ) ( 216 ) ( 32 ) ( 112 ) ( 985 ) Goodwill at March 31, 2022 $ 13,659 $ 12,838 $ 7,831 $ 1,841 $ 4,541 $ 40,710 Goodwill decreased from June 30, 2021 due to currency translation, partially offset by three acquisitions (Farmacy Beauty, Ouai and TULA) in the Beauty reportable segment. Identifiable intangible assets at March 31, 2022 were comprised of: Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Intangible assets with determinable lives $ 9,147 $ ( 6,262 ) Intangible assets with indefinite lives 21,028 — Total identifiable intangible assets $ 30,175 $ ( 6,262 ) Intangible assets with determinable lives consist of brands, patents, technology and customer relationships. The intangible assets with indefinite lives primarily consist of brands. The amortization expense of determinable-lived intangible assets for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021 was $ 79 and $ 78 , respectively. For the nine months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, the amortization expense was $ 230 and $ 241 , respectively. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment by comparing the estimated fair values of our reporting units and underlying indefinite-lived intangible assets to their respective carrying values. We typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of these assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. If the resulting fair value is less than the asset's carrying value, that difference represents an impairment. Our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets occurs during the three months ended December 31. The business unit valuations used to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment depend on a number of significant estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment, margin expansion and Company business plans. We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable. However, future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount rates, tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. To the extent changes in such factors result in a failure to achieve the level of projected cash flows initially used to estimate fair value for purposes of establishing or subsequently impairing the carrying amount of goodwill and related intangible assets, we may need to record non-cash impairment charges in the future. Most of our goodwill reporting units are comprised of a combination of legacy and acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that, at a minimum, exceed three times their underlying carrying values. Certain of our reporting units, in particular Shave Care and Appliances, are comprised entirely of acquired businesses and as a result, have historically had fair value cushions that are not as high. The Appliances reporting unit has a fair value that significantly exceeds the underlying carrying value. As previously disclosed, the carrying values of the Shave Care reporting unit and the related Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset were impaired during the quarter ended June 30, 2019. Based on our impairment testing during the three months ended December 31, 2021, the Shave Care reporting unit fair value exceeded its carrying value by more than 30 % and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 5 %. The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the net sales and earnings growth rates (including residual growth rates), the discount rate and the royalty rate. The residual growth rates represent the expected rate at which the Shave Care reporting unit and Gillette brand are expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period. The residual growth rate utilized in our fair value estimates is consistent with the reporting unit and brand operating plans and approximates expected long-term category market growth rates. The residual growth rate depends on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, relative currency exchange rates and business activities that impact market share. As a result, the residual growth rate could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes, devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or an increased competitive environment. The discount rate, which is consistent with a weighted average Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, such as further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar. Spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the U.S. The royalty rate used to determine the estimated fair value for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is driven by historical and estimated future profitability of the underlying Gillette business. The royalty rate may be impacted by significant adverse changes in long-term operating margins. While management has implemented strategies to address these events, changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that would trigger future impairment charges of the Shave Care reporting unit's goodwill and Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset. The duration and severity of the pandemic could also result in future impairment charges for the Shave Care reporting unit goodwill and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset. While we have concluded that no triggering event has occurred during the quarter ended March 31, 2022, the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is most susceptible to future impairment risk. Our assessment of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset assumes the net sales growth rates will continue to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic during the current fiscal year. There continues to be a high level of uncertainty relating to how the pandemic will evolve, how governments and consumers will react, progress on the distribution of vaccines and whether the pandemic will have a longer-term effect on consumer habits. Accordingly, there continues to be risk related to this key assumption. A more prolonged pandemic recovery period could impact the assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset that are significant enough to trigger an impairment. Net sales and earnings growth rates could be negatively impacted by reductions or changes in demand for our Shave Care products, which may be caused by, among other things: the Russia-Ukraine War, the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine or other travel restrictions, or financial hardship, changes in the use and frequency of grooming products, by shifts in demand away from one or more of our higher priced products to lower priced products or by impacts of potential supply chain constraints. In addition, relative global and country/regional macroeconomic factors, including the Russia-Ukraine War, could result in additional and prolonged devaluation of other countries’ currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Finally, the discount rate utilized in our valuation model could be impacted by changes in the underlying interest rates and risk premiums included in the determination of the cost of capital. As of March 31, 2022, the carrying values of the Shave Care goodwill and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset were $ 12.5 billion and $ 14.1 billion, respectively. We performed a sensitivity analysis for the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset as part of our annual impairment testing, utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the shorter-term and residual growth rates, discount rate and royalty rate to demonstrate the potential impacts to estimated fair values. The table below provides, in isolation, the estimated fair value impacts related to a 25 basis-point increase in the discount rate, a 25 basis-point decrease in our shorter-term and residual revenue growth rates or a 50 basis-point decrease in our royalty rate, some of which would result in an impairment of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset.

Under these scenarios, the Shave Care reporting unit fair value continued to exceed its carrying value by approximately 30 % and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset’s fair value exceeded or approximated its carrying value. However, if the impact of the war were to extend beyond its current scope, there could be a triggering event for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset that may cause us to perform an additional impairment assessment for that asset in a future period that may result in an impairment charge. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. 5. Earnings Per Share Basic net earnings per common share are calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble less preferred dividends by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net earnings per common share are calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble by the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. The diluted shares include the dilutive effect of stock options and other stock-based awards based on the treasury stock method and the assumed conversion of preferred stock. Net earnings per share were calculated as follows: CONSOLIDATED AMOUNTS Three Months Ended March 31 Nine Months Ended March 31 2022 2021 2022 2021 Net earnings $ 3,367 $ 3,249 $ 11,735 $ 11,444 Less: Net earnings/(loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 12 ( 20 ) 45 44 Net earnings attributable to P&G (Diluted) 3,355 3,269 11,690 11,400 Less: Preferred dividends 68 65 208 197 Net earnings attributable to P&G available to common shareholders (Basic) $ 3,287 $ 3,204 $ 11,482 $ 11,203 SHARES IN MILLIONS Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 2,400.5 2,459.1 2,414.0 2,473.7 Add: Effect of dilutive securities Convertible preferred shares (1) 78.9 82.3 79.7 83.1 Stock options and other unvested equity awards (2) 50.8 48.9 50.7 53.6 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 2,530.2 2,590.3 2,544.4 2,610.4 NET EARNINGS PER SHARE (3) Basic $ 1.37 $ 1.30 $ 4.76 $ 4.53 Diluted $ 1.33 $ 1.26 $ 4.59 $ 4.37 (1) An overview of preferred shares can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2021. (2) Excludes 5 million and 12 million for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and 11 million and 8 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, of weighted average stock options outstanding because the exercise price of these options was greater than their average market value or their effect was antidilutive. (3) Net earnings per share are calculated on Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble. 6. Share-Based Compensation and Postretirement Benefits The following table provides a summary of our share-based compensation expense and postretirement benefit costs: Three Months Ended March 31 Nine Months Ended March 31 2022 2021 2022 2021 Share-based compensation expense $ 130 $ 144 $ 398 $ 398 Net periodic benefit cost for pension benefits 47 48 143 141 Net periodic benefit credit for other retiree benefits ( 126 ) ( 80 ) ( 348 ) ( 240 ) Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. 7. Risk Management Activities and Fair Value Measurements As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. There have been no significant changes in our risk management policies or activities during the nine months ended March 31, 2022. The Company has not changed its valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period. The Company recognizes transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of each quarter. There were no transfers between levels during the periods presented. Also, there was no significant activity within the Level 3 assets and liabilities during the periods presented. There were no significant assets or liabilities that were remeasured at fair value on a non-recurring basis for the nine months ended March 31, 2022. Cash equivalents were $ 7.0 billion and $ 9.1 billion as of March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2021, respectively, and are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. Other investments had a fair value of $ 153 and $ 192 as of March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2021, respectively, including equity securities of $ 126 and $ 163 as of March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2021, respectively, and are presented in Other noncurrent assets. Investments are measured at fair value and primarily classified as Level 1 and Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Level 1 are based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets, and Level 2 are based on quoted market prices for similar instruments. There are no material investment balances classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy or using net asset value as a practical expedient. Unrealized losses on equity securities were $( 4 ) during the three months ended March 31, 2022. Unrealized gains on equity securities were $ 58 during the three months ended March 31, 2021. Unrealized losses on equity securities were $( 36 ) during the nine months ended March 31, 2022. Unrealized gains on equity securities were $ 58 during the nine months ended March 31, 2021. These unrealized gains/(losses) are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in Other non-operating income/(expense), net. The fair value of long-term debt was $ 27.8 billion and $ 28.8 billion as of March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2021, respectively. This includes the current portion of long-term debt instruments ($ 3.6 billion as of March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2021). Certain long-term debt (debt designated as a fair value hedge) is recorded at fair value. All other long-term debt is recorded at amortized cost but is measured at fair value for disclosure purposes. We consider our debt to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Fair values are generally estimated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments. Disclosures about Financial Instruments The notional amounts and fair values of financial instruments used in hedging transactions as of March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2021 are as follows: Notional Amount Fair Value Asset Fair Value (Liability) March 31, 2022 June 30, 2021 March 31, 2022 June 30, 2021 March 31, 2022 June 30, 2021 DERIVATIVES IN FAIR VALUE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Interest rate contracts $ 5,241 $ 7,415 $ 15 $ 146 $ ( 182 ) $ — DERIVATIVES IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Foreign currency interest rate contracts $ 8,428 $ 8,484 $ 359 $ 89 $ ( 10 ) $ ( 94 ) TOTAL DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS $ 13,669 $ 15,899 $ 374 $ 235 $ ( 192 ) $ ( 94 ) DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS Foreign currency contracts $ 6,916 $ 5,060 $ 31 $ 20 $ ( 26 ) $ ( 22 ) TOTAL DERIVATIVES AT FAIR VALUE $ 20,585 $ 20,959 $ 405 $ 255 $ ( 218 ) $ ( 116 ) The fair value of the interest rate derivative asset/(liability) directly offsets the cumulative amount of the fair value hedging adjustment included in the carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation. The carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation, which includes the unamortized discount or premium and the fair value adjustment, was $ 5.1 billion and $ 7.5 billion as of March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2021, respectively. In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges. The carrying value of those debt instruments designated as net investment hedges, which includes the adjustment for the foreign currency transaction gain or loss on those instruments, was $ 12.2 billion and $ 12.0 billion as of March 31, 2022 and June 30, 2021, respectively. The decrease in the notional balance of interest rate contracts was primarily due to the maturity of interest rate swaps that were associated with multiple bonds maturing in the period. The increase in the notional balance of foreign currency contracts not designated as hedging instruments primarily reflects changes in the level of intercompany financing activity during the period. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. All derivative assets are presented in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Other noncurrent assets. All derivative liabilities are presented in Accrued and other liabilities or Other noncurrent liabilities. Changes in the fair value of net investment hedges are recognized in the Foreign currency translation component of Other comprehensive income (OCI). All of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Before tax gains/(losses) on our financial instruments in hedging relationships are categorized as follows: Amount of Gain/(Loss) Recognized in OCI on Derivatives Three Months Ended March 31 Nine Months Ended March 31 2022 2021 2022 2021 DERIVATIVES IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS (1) (2) Foreign exchange contracts $ 104 $ 393 $ 530 $ (145) (1) For the derivatives in net investment hedging relationships, the amount of gain excluded from effectiveness testing, which was recognized in earnings, was $ 18 and $ 15 for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The amount of gain excluded from effectiveness testing was $ 50 and $ 45 for the nine months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. (2) In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges. The amount of gain recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) for such instruments was $ 237 and $ 509 for the three months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The amount of gain/(loss) recognized in AOCI for such instruments was $ 804 and $( 732 ) for the nine months ended March 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Amount of Gain/(Loss) Recognized in Earnings Three Months Ended March 31 Nine Months Ended March 31 2022 2021 2022 2021 DERIVATIVES IN FAIR VALUE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Interest rate contracts $ ( 216 ) $ ( 100 ) $ ( 313 ) $ ( 95 ) DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS Foreign currency contracts $ ( 2 ) $ ( 87 ) $ 28 $ 221 The gain/(loss) on the derivatives in fair value hedging relationships is fully offset by the mark-to-market impact of the related exposure. These are both recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in Interest expense. The gain/(loss) on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is substantially offset by the currency mark-to-market of the related exposure. These are both recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A). Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. 8. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss) The table below presents the changes in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) attributable to Procter & Gamble (AOCI), including the reclassifications out of AOCI by component: Investment Securities Post-retirement Benefits Foreign Currency Translation Total AOCI Balance at June 30, 2021 $ 15 $ ( 2,963 ) $ ( 10,796 ) $ ( 13,744 ) OCI before reclassifications (1) 6 812 ( 683 ) 135 Amounts reclassified from AOCI into the Consolidated Statements of Earnings (2) 1 156 157 Net current period OCI 7 968 ( 683 ) 292 Less: Other comprehensive income/(loss) attributable to non-controlling interests — — ( 4 ) ( 4 ) Balance at March 31, 2022 $ 22 $ ( 1,995 ) $ ( 11,475 ) $ ( 13,448 ) (1) Net of tax expense of $ 1 , $ 257 and $ 314 for gains/losses on investment securities, postretirement benefit items and foreign currency translation, respectively. Income tax effects within foreign currency translation include impacts from items such as net investment hedge transactions. Foreign cumulative translation is not adjusted for income taxes related to permanent investments in international subsidiaries. (2) Net of tax expense of $ 0 , $ 55 and $ 0 for gains/losses on investment securities, postretirement benefit items and foreign currency translation, respectively. The below provides additional details on amounts reclassified from AOCI into the Consolidated Statements of Earnings: • Investment securities: amounts reclassified from AOCI into Other non-operating income, net. • Postretirement benefits: amounts reclassified from AOCI into Other non-operating income, net and included in the computation of net periodic postretirement costs. 9. Commitments and Contingencies Litigation We are subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental, patent and trademark matters, labor and employment matters and tax. While considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management and our counsel, the ultimate resolution of the various lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior manufacturing and waste disposal practices. Based on currently available information, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of environmental remediation will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Income Tax Uncertainties The Company is present in approximately 70 countries and over 150 taxable jurisdictions and, at any point in time, has 40 – 50 jurisdictional audits underway at various stages of completion. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite our belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitations. Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate. We have tax years open ranging from 2010 and forward. We are generally not able to reliably estimate the ultimate settlement amounts until the close of an audit. Based on information currently available, we anticipate that over the next 12 month period, audit activity could be completed related to uncertain tax positions in multiple jurisdictions for which we have accrued existing liabilities of less than $ 10 , including interest and penalties. Additional information on the Commitments and Contingencies of the Company can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2021. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. Item 2.

A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected herein, is included in the section titled ""Economic Conditions and Uncertainties"" and the section titled ""Risk Factors"" (Part II, Item 1A) of this Form 10-Q. The purpose of Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is to provide an understanding of Procter & Gamble's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. The MD&A is organized into the following sections: • Overview • Summary of Results – Nine months ended March 31, 2022 • Economic Conditions and Uncertainties • Results of Operations – Three and Nine Months ended March 31, 2022 • Business Segment Discussion – Three and Nine Months ended March 31, 2022 • Liquidity and Capital Resources • Reconciliation of Measures Not Defined by U.S. GAAP Throughout the MD&A, we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales and net earnings. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), that include organic sales gr owth, core net earnings per share (Core EPS), adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity. The explanation at the end of the MD&A provides the definition of these non-GAAP measures, details on the use and the derivation of these measures, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition, despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and market consumption in the MD&A are based on a combination of vendor purchased traditional brick-and-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales of our products in dollar terms on a constant currency basis relative to all product sales in the category. The Company measures fiscal year to date market shares through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months as compared to the end of the reporting period. Management also uses unit volume growth to evaluate and explain drivers of changes in net sales. Organic volume growth reflects year-over-year changes in unit volume excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and certain one-time items, if applicable, and is used to explain changes in organic sales. OVERVIEW P&G is a global leader in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories, primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce, social commerce, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, baby stores, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores and professional channels. We also sell direct to consumers. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries. Our market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We believe we are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position. The table below lists our reportable segments, including the product categories and brand composition within each segment. Reportable Segments Product Categories (Sub-Categories) Major Brands Beauty Hair Care ( Conditioners, Shampoos, Styling Aids, Treatments ) Head & Shoulders, Herbal Essences, Pantene, Rejoice Skin and Personal Care ( Antiperspirants and Deodorants, Personal Cleansing, Skin Care ) Olay, Old Spice, Safeguard, Secret, SK-II Grooming Grooming (1) (Shave Care - Female Blades & Razors, Male Blades & Razors, Pre- and Post-Shave Products, Other Shave Care; Appliances) Braun, Gillette, Venus Health Care Oral Care ( Toothbrushes, Toothpastes, Other Oral Care ) Crest, Oral-B Personal Health Care ( Gastrointestinal, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements, Pain Relief, Other Personal Health Care ) Metamucil, Neurobion, Pepto-Bismol, Vicks Fabric & Home Care Fabric Care ( Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Additives, Laundry Detergents ) Ariel, Downy, Gain, Tide Home Care ( Air Care, Dish Care, P&G Professional, Surface Care ) Cascade, Dawn, Fairy, Febreze, Mr. Clean, Swiffer Baby, Feminine & Family Care Baby Care ( Baby Wipes, Taped Diapers and Pants ) Luvs, Pampers Feminine Care ( Adult Incontinence, Feminine Care ) Always, Always Discreet, Tampax Family Care ( Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper ) Bounty, Charmin, Puffs (1) The Grooming product category is comprised of the Shave Care and Appliances operating segments. The following table provides the percentage of net sales and net earnings by reportable business segment for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2022 (excluding net sales and net earnings in Corporate): Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 Nine Months Ended March 31, 2022 Net Sales Net Earnings Net Sales Net Earnings Beauty 17% 20% 19% 23% Grooming 8% 9% 8% 10% Health Care 14% 15% 14% 15% Fabric & Home Care 35% 30% 34% 29% Baby, Feminine & Family Care 26% 26% 25% 23% Total Company 100% 100% 100% 100% SUMMARY OF RESULTS The following are highlights of results for the nine months ended March 31, 2022 versus the nine months ended March 31, 2021: • Net sales increased 6% to $60.7 billion, due to a double digit increase in Health Care, a high single digit increase in Fabric & Home Care, mid-single digit increases in Grooming and Baby, Feminine & Family Care and a low single digit increase in Beauty. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, increased 7%. Overall, organic sales increased double digits in Health Care, increased high single digits in Fabric & Home Care, increased mid-single digits in Grooming and Baby, Feminine & Family Care and increased low single digits in Beauty. • Net earnings were $11.7 billion, an increase of $0.3 billion, or 3%, versus the prior year period due to the increase in net sales and a prior year period loss on early debt extinguishment, partially offset by a decrease in operating margin. • Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble were $11.7 billion, an increase of $0.3 billion, or 3%, versus the prior year. • Diluted net earnings per share (EPS) increased 5% to $4.59 due primarily to the increase in net earnings and a reduction in the weighted average shares outstanding. Net earnings per share increased 1% versus the prior year period core net earnings per share due to the prior period loss on early debt extinguishment. • Operating cash flow was $13.0 billion. Adjusted free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less capital expenditures and certain other impacts, was $10.8 billion. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 92%. ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES Global Economic Conditions. Our products are sold in numerous countries across North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa, with more than half our sales generated outside the United States. As such, we are exposed to and impacted by global macroeconomic factors, U.S. and foreign government policies and foreign exchange fluctuations. Global economic conditions continue to be highly volatile due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in market size contractions in certain countries due to economic slowdowns and government restrictions on movement. Other macroeconomic factors also remain dynamic, and any causes of market size contraction, such as greater political unrest or instability in the Middle East, Central & Eastern Europe (including the ongoing Russia-Ukraine War), certain Latin American markets, the Hong Kong market in Greater China and the Korean peninsula could reduce our sales or erode our operating margin, and consequently reduce our net earnings and cash flows. Changes in Costs. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, transportation costs and our own productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp. Volatility in the market price of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs. Disruptions in our manufacturing, supply and distribution operations, including energy shortages, port congestions, labor constraints and freight container and truck shortages have impacted our costs and could do so in the future. If we are unable to manage these impacts through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions, as well as through consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. Net sales could also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on the consumption of our products. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including outsourcing projects, supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. If we are not successful in executing and sustaining these changes, there could be a negative impact on our gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. Foreign Exchange. We have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates. Translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation of transaction-related working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. In three out of the past four years, a number of foreign currencies have weakened versus the U.S. dollar, leading to lower sales and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts. Certain countries that recently had and are currently experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations include Argentina, Turkey, Brazil and Russia. These fluctuations have significantly impacted our historical net sales, costs and net earnings and could do so in the future. Increased pricing in response to certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could also have a negative impact on the consumption of our products, which would negatively affect our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. Government Policies. Our net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government legislative, regulatory or enforcement policies. For example, our net earnings and cash flows could be affected by any future legislative or regulatory changes in U.S. or non-U.S. tax policy, or any significant change in global tax policy adopted under the current work being led by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (""OECD"") for the G20 focused on ""Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy."" The breadth of the OECD project extends beyond pure digital businesses, and if agreed and enacted by most countries, is likely to impact most large multinational businesses by both redefining jurisdictional taxation rights and broadly establishing a 15% minimum tax on their foreign operations. Our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows may also be impacted by changes in U.S. and foreign government policies related to environmental and climate change matters. Additionally, we attempt to carefully manage our debt, currency and other exposures in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and pricing controls, such as Nigeria, Algeria, Egypt, Argentina and Turkey. Further, our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes to international trade agreements in North America and elsewhere. Changes in government policies in these areas might cause an increase or decrease in our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. COVID-19 Disclosures. Because we sell products that are essential to the daily lives of consumers, the pandemic has not had a materially negative impact to our consolidated net sales, as positive and negative impacts continue to largely offset each other. We further describe these impacts for the period covered by this report in the Business Segment Discussion of the MD&A. The continued evolution of the pandemic and emergence of new variants may result in economic recessions or a slowdown of economic growth in certain countries or globally. This may result in reduced demand for our products that would have a negative impact on our net sales, net earnings and cash flows. It could also lead to volatility in consumer access to our products (due to government actions or key material, transportation and labor shortages impacting our ability to produce and ship products) or could impact consumers’ movements and access to our products. The resumption towards normalcy in economic activity as governmental restrictions are relaxed and economies gradually, partially or fully reopen in certain regions and markets, could also result in reduced demand due to consumption decreases and consumer pantry destocking (particularly, in home cleaning and hygiene products). Our retail customers are also impacted by the pandemic, and their success in addressing issues and maintaining their operations could impact consumer access to and, as a result, sales of our products. We believe that in the long term, there will continue to be strong demand for categories in which we operate, particularly our products that deliver essential health, hygiene and cleaning benefits. However, the uncertainty in the timing and extent of demand volatility, the relaxation and reimplementation of movement restrictions, the timing and impact of potential consumer pantry destocking, the future economic trends due to a resurgence of positive cases, the emergence of new variants of the virus, the speed at which treatments and vaccines are administered and governmental actions in response to the pandemic may result in heightened volatility of net sales, net earnings and cash flows during and subsequent to the pandemic. Business Continuity . Our ability to continue to operate without any significant negative impacts will, in part, depend on our ability to protect our employees and our supply chain. The Company has endeavored to follow the recommendations from governments and health authorities, including on vaccine administration, with specific measures in place for those working in our plants and distribution facilities. We have also worked closely with local and national officials to keep our manufacturing facilities open due to the essential nature of the majority of our products. While we have been able to broadly maintain our operations, we experienced some disruption in our supply chain in certain markets due primarily to the restriction of employee movements, key material and labor shortages and transportation constraints. We intend to continue to work with our suppliers and government authorities to implement employee safety measures to minimize disruption to the manufacturing and distribution of our products. However, uncertainty in the duration and scope of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants of the virus, the likelihood of a resurgence of positive cases, the speed at which treatments and vaccines are administered and governmental actions in response to the pandemic could result in an unforeseen disruption to our supply chain and impact our operations (for example, the closure of a key manufacturing or distribution facility or the inability of a key material or transportation supplier to source and transport materials). Liquidity . Because the pandemic, thus far, has not had a material negative impact on our operations, on the demand for our products or the resulting net sales and net earnings, it has not negatively impacted the Company’s liquidity position. We continue to generate operating cash flows to meet our short-term liquidity needs and continue to maintain access to capital markets enabled by our strong short- and long-term credit ratings. Impairments . We have not observed any material impairments or other significant reductions in the fair value of our recorded assets due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Russia-Ukraine War. The war between Russia and Ukraine has negatively impacted our operations in both countries. Our Ukraine business includes two manufacturing sites. We have approximately 500 employees including both manufacturing and non-manufacturing personnel. In fiscal 2021, our operations in Ukraine accounted for less than 1% of consolidated net sales and net earnings. Additionally, net assets of our Ukraine subsidiary, along with Ukraine related assets held by other subsidiaries, account for less than 1% of net assets as of March 31, 2022. Our Russia business includes two manufacturing sites with a net book value of approximately $250 million. We have approximately 2,500 employees, including both manufacturing and non-manufacturing personnel. In fiscal 2021, our operations in Russia accounted for less than 2% of consolidated net sales and less than 1% of net earnings. Additionally, net assets of our Russia subsidiaries, along with Russia related assets held by other subsidiaries, account for less than 2% of net assets as of March 31, 2022. In March 2022, the Company announced a reduction of its product portfolio, the discontinuation of new capital investments and the suspension of media, advertising and promotional activity in Russia. Future impacts to the Company are difficult to predict due to the high level of uncertainty as to how the war will evolve, what its duration will be and its ultimate resolution. Within Ukraine, there is a possibility of physical damage and destruction of our two manufacturing facilities. We may not be able to operate our manufacturing sites and source raw materials from our suppliers or ship finished products to our customers. Ultimately, these could result in impairments of our manufacturing plants and fixed assets or write-downs of other operating assets and working capital. Within Russia, we may not be able to continue our reduced operations at current levels due to sanctions and counter-sanctions, monetary, currency or payment controls, restrictions on access to financial institutions and supply and transportation challenges. Our suppliers, distributors and retail customers are also impacted by the war and their ability to successfully maintain their operations could also impact our operations or negatively impact the sales of our products. More broadly, there could be additional negative impacts to our net sales, earnings and cash flows should the situation escalate beyond its current scope, including, among other potential impacts, economic recessions in certain neighboring countries or globally due to inflationary pressures and supply chain cost increases or the geographic proximity of the war relative to the rest of Europe. For a more complete discussion of the risks we encounter in our business, please refer to Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 The following discussion provides a review of results for the three months ended March 31, 2022 versus the three months ended March 31, 2021. Three Months Ended March 31 Amounts in millions, except per share amounts 2022 2021 % Chg Net sales $19,381 $18,109 7% Operating income 4,024 3,785 6% Net earnings 3,367 3,249 4% Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 3,355 3,269 3% Diluted net earnings per common share 1.33 1.26 6% Three Months Ended March 31 COMPARISONS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES 2022 2021 Basis Pt Chg Gross margin 46.7% 50.7% (400) Selling, general & administrative expense 26.0% 29.8% (380) Operating income 20.8% 20.9% (10) Earnings before income taxes 21.0% 21.4% (40) Net earnings 17.4% 17.9% (50) Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 17.3% 18.1% (80) Net Sales Net sales for the quarter increased 7% to $19.4 billion. Unit volume increased 3%. Foreign exchange had a 3% negative impact on net sales. Higher pricing increased net sales by 5%. Mix increased net sales by 2% due to positive geographic mix from the disproportionate growth of the North America region and positive category mix from the disproportionate growth of the Personal Health Care business, both of which have higher than Company-average selling prices. Organic sales increased 10% on a 3% increase in organic volume. Net sales increased double digits in Health Care, increased high single digits in Fabric & Home Care and in Baby, Feminine & Family Care, and increased low single digits in Grooming and in Beauty. On a regional basis, volume increased mid-single digits in North America and Latin America, and increased low single digits in Europe and Asia Pacific. These increases were partially offset by a mid-single digit volume decrease in Greater China.

(2) Other includes the sales mix impact from acquisitions and divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile volume to net sales. Operating Costs Gross margin decreased 400 basis points to 46.7% of net sales for the quarter. The decrease in gross margin was due to: • 410 basis points of increased commodity costs, • a 130 basis-point decline from unfavorable mix, primarily due to negative product mix resulting from the launch and growth of premium-priced products that are profit-accretive but have lower than Company-average gross margin, • 70 basis points of net manufacturing cost increases as 80 basis points of increased transportation costs and 30 basis points of product and packaging investments were partially offset by 40 basis points of gross savings and • a 20 basis-point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. These impacts were partially offset by • a 220 basis-point increase due to higher pricing and • 10 basis points of increased cost leverage due to the growth of net sales. Total SG&A spending decreased 7% to $5 billion due to decreased marketing spending, overhead costs and other operating costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 380 basis points to 26% due primarily to decreases in both marketing and overhead costs as a percentage of sales. Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales decreased 140 basis points primarily due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and productivity savings, partially offset by inflation and other cost increases. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 220 basis points due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase, savings in production costs and lower spending versus the prior year period with a high level of media spending. Other operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 20 basis points. Productivity-driven cost savings delivered 130 basis points of benefit to SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Non-Operating Expenses and Income Interest expense was $109 million for the quarter, a $3 million increase versus the prior year period. Interest income was $9 million for the quarter, a $2 million decrease versus the prior year period. Other non-operating income was $147 million, a decline of $40 million primarily due to an unrealized gain on equity investments in the prior year period, partially offset by a current period increase in net non-operating benefits on defined benefit retirement plans. Income Taxes For the three months ended March 31, 2022, the effective tax rate increased 105 basis points to 17.3% due to: • an 80 basis-point increase from discrete impacts related to uncertain tax positions (15 basis points of unfavorable impact in the current period versus 65 basis points of favorable impact in the prior year period), • a 55 basis-point increase from lower current period deductions for foreign-derived intangible income versus prior year period, and • 45 basis points of increase due to unfavorable geographic mix of current year earnings. These increases were partially offset by a 75 basis-point decrease from higher excess tax benefits of share-based compensation (a 255 basis-point benefit in the current period versus a 180 basis-point benefit in the prior year period). Net Earnings Operating income increased $0.2 billion, or 6%, to $4.0 billion for the quarter, as the increase in net sales was partially offset by the decrease in operating margin, the components of which are described above. Net earnings increased $0.1 billion, or 4%, to $3.4 billion as the increase in operating income was partially offset by a decrease in other non-operating income and an increase in effective income tax rate. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of approximately $130 million on net earnings for the quarter, including both transactional and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars. Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $0.1 billion, or 3%, to $3.4 billion for the quarter. Diluted net earnings per share of $1.33 increased by 6% versus the prior year period due to the increase in net earnings and a reduction in the weighted average number of shares outstanding. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Nine Months Ended March 31, 2022 The following discussion provides a review of results for the nine months ended March 31, 2022 versus the nine months ended March 31, 2021. Nine Months Ended March 31 Amounts in millions, except per share amounts 2022 2021 % Chg Net sales $60,672 $57,172 6% Operating income 14,215 14,446 (2)% Net earnings 11,735 11,444 3% Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 11,690 11,400 3% Diluted net earnings per common share 4.59 4.37 5% Core net earnings per common share 4.59 4.53 1% Nine Months Ended March 31 COMPARISONS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES 2022 2021 Basis Pt Chg Gross margin 48.3% 52.2% (390) Selling, general & administrative expense 24.9% 27.0% (210) Operating income 23.4% 25.3% (190) Earnings before income taxes 23.6% 24.6% (100) Net earnings 19.3% 20.0% (70) Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 19.3% 19.9% (60) Net Sales Net sales for the period increased 6% to $60.7 billion on a 3% increase in unit volume. Higher pricing increased net sales by 3%. Positive mix increased net sales by 1% driven by positive geographic and category mix caused by the disproportionate growth of the North America region and the Personal Health Care category, both of which have higher than Company-average selling prices. This was partially offset by the disproportionate growth of the Fabric Care business, which has lower than Company-average selling prices. Unfavorable foreign exchange decreased net sales by 1%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, organic sales increased 7%. Net sales increased double digits in Health Care, increased high single digits in Fabric & Home Care, increased mid-single digits in Grooming and Baby, Feminine & Family Care, and increased low single digits in Beauty. On a regional basis, volume increased mid-single digits in North America and Latin America and low single digits in Europe and Asia Pacific, partially offset by low single digit decreases in Greater China and IMEA.

(2) Other includes the sales mix impact from acquisitions and divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile volume to net sales. Operating Costs Gross margin decreased 390 basis points to 48.3% of net sales for the period. The decrease in gross margin was due to: • 380 basis points of increased commodity costs, • a 140 basis-point decline from unfavorable mix, primarily due to negative product mix caused by the launch and disproportionate growth of premium-priced products that are profit-accretive but have lower than Company-average gross margin and • 10 basis points of net manufacturing cost increases as 60 basis points of increased transportation costs and 20 basis points of product and packaging investments were partially offset by 70 basis points of gross savings. These impacts were offset by: • a 130 basis-point increase due to higher pricing and • 10 basis points of benefit from favorable foreign exchange impacts. Total SG&A spending decreased 2% to $15.1 billion due to decreased marketing spending, overhead costs and other operating costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 210 basis points to 24.9% primarily due to decreases in both overhead costs and marketing spending as a percentage of net sales. Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales decreased 100 basis points primarily due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and productivity savings, partially offset by inflation and other cost increases. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 100 basis points due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and increased savings. Other operating expenses as a percentage of net sales declined 10 basis points, as a gain on the sale of operating real estate was offset by increased foreign exchange transactional charges. Productivity-driven cost savings delivered 80 basis points of benefit to SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Non-Operating Expenses and Income Interest expense was $324 million for the period, a $61 million decrease versus the prior year period driven by lower average interest rates. Interest income was $30 million for the period, unchanged versus the prior year period. Net other non-operating income was $424 million, an improvement of $464 million due primarily to a prior period loss on early-debt extinguishment and a current period increase in net non-operating benefits on defined benefit retirement plans, partially offset by unrealized gains on equity investments in the prior period and unrealized losses on equity investments in the current period. Income Taxes For the nine months ended March 31, 2022, the effective tax rate decreased 35 basis points versus the prior year period to 18.2% due to: • a 55 basis-point decrease from higher excess tax benefits of share-based compensation (a 225 basis-point benefit in the current period versus a 170 basis-point benefit in the prior year period) and • a 10 basis-point decrease from the impact of the early extinguishment of debt in the prior year period. These decreases were partially offset by: • a 15 basis-point increase from discrete impacts related to uncertain tax positions (a 10 basis-point favorable impact in the current period versus a 25 basis-point favorable impact in the prior year period) and • a 15 basis-point increase from unfavorable impacts from the geographic mix of current year to date earnings. Net Earnings Operating income decreased $0.2 billion, or 2%, to $14.2 billion for the fiscal year to date period, as the increase in net sales was more than offset by the decrease in operating margin, the components of which are described above. Net earnings increased $0.3 billion, or 3%, to $11.7 billion for the fiscal year to date period as the decrease in operating income was more than offset by the increase in other non-operating income and by the decrease in interest expense. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of approximately $110 million on net earnings for the period, including both transactional and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars. Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $0.3 billion, or 3%, to $11.7 billion for the fiscal year to date period. Diluted net earnings per share increased 5% to $4.59 versus the prior year period due to the increase in net earnings and a reduction in the weighted average number of shares outstanding. BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSION – Three and Nine Months ended March 31, 2022 The following discussion provides a review of results by reportable business segment. Analysis of the results for the three and nine month periods ended March 31, 2022 is provided based on a comparison to the three and nine month periods ended March 31, 2021. The primary financial measures used to evaluate segment performance are net sales and net earnings. The table below provides supplemental information on net sales, earnings before income taxes and net earnings by reportable business segment for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2022 versus the comparable prior year period (dollar amounts in millions): Three Months Ended March 31, 2022 Net Sales % Change Versus Year Ago Earnings/(Loss) Before Income Taxes % Change Versus Year Ago Net Earnings % Change Versus Year Ago Beauty $ 3,389 2 % $ 792 10 % $ 644 12 % Grooming 1,481 3 % 353 12 % 290 13 % Health Care 2,662 13 % 625 29 % 485 29 % Fabric & Home Care 6,699 7 % 1,275 (5) % 969 (6) % Baby, Feminine & Family Care 4,935 7 % 1,091 (4) % 836 (4) % Corporate 215 N/A (65) N/A 143 N/A Total Company $ 19,381 7 % $ 4,071 5 % $ 3,367 4 % Nine Months Ended March 31, 2022 Net Sales % Change Versus Year Ago Earnings/(Loss) Before Income Taxes % Change Versus Year Ago Net Earnings % Change Versus Year Ago Beauty $ 11,279 3 % $ 3,213 2 % $ 2,582 3 % Grooming 4,979 4 % 1,447 13 % 1,183 11 % Health Care 8,314 10 % 2,225 12 % 1,715 10 % Fabric & Home Care 20,680 7 % 4,284 (9) % 3,297 (9) % Baby, Feminine & Family Care 14,915 5 % 3,353 (12) % 2,576 (12) % Corporate 505 N/A (177) N/A 382 N/A Total Company $ 60,672 6 % $ 14,345 2 % $ 11,735 3 % Beauty Three months ended March 31, 2022 compared with three months ended March 31, 2021 Beauty net sales increased 2% to $3.4 billion on unit volume that was unchanged. Higher pricing increased net sales by 4%. Foreign exchange impacts decreased net sales by 2%. Excluding the impacts of the Farmacy Beauty, Ouai and TULA acquisitions, organic sales increased 3% on a 1% decrease in organic volume. Global market share of the Beauty segment increased 0.1 points. • Hair Care net sales increased low single digits. Negative impacts of a low single digit volume decrease and unfavorable foreign exchange were more than fully offset by increased pricing and favorable mix, due to the growth of premium products and the acquisitions. Organic sales also increased low single digits. Volume decreased high single digits in IMEA (due to competitive activity and lower shipments following increased pricing), decreased mid-single digits in North America (due to supply shortages in stylers following a product recall in the prior period) and Greater China (due to pandemic-related lockdowns and market slowdown in traditional retailers where our shares are disproportionally higher, versus social commerce retailers) and decreased low single digits in Latin America (due to competitive activity). Global market share of the Hair Care category decreased more than a point. • Skin and Personal Care net sales increased mid-single digits. Positive impacts of a mid-single digit volume increase and increased pricing were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange and unfavorable mix (due to a lower proportion of SK-II brand and Greater China, both of which have higher than category-average selling prices). Excluding the impacts of the acquisitions, organic sales increased low single digits. Volume increased high teens in Latin America (due to market growth) and increased double digits in North America (due to market growth versus the prior year period that was negatively impacted by the pandemic). This volume increase was partially offset by a mid-single digit decrease in Greater China (due to pandemic-related lockdowns and market slowdown in traditional retailers where our shares are disproportionally higher, versus social commerce retailers). Excluding the impacts of the acquisitions, volume in North America increased high single digits. Global market share of the Skin and Personal Care category increased more than half a point. Net earnings increased 12% to $644 million due to the increase in net sales and a 160 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin increased due to a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by a decrease in gross margin. The gross margin reduction was driven by increased commodity and transportation costs, negative product mix caused by a lower proportion of sales of SK-II brand (which has higher than segment-average gross margins), partially offset by increased pricing and manufacturing cost savings. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased as the positive scale benefits of the net sales increase and a decrease in media spending were partially offset by an increase in overhead costs. Nine months ended March 31, 2022 compared with nine months ended March 31, 2021 Beauty net sales increased 3% to $11.3 billion on unit volume that was unchanged. Higher pricing increased net sales by 3%. Foreign exchange had a neutral impact to net sales. Excluding the impacts of the Farmacy Beauty, Ouai and TULA acquisitions, organic sales increased 3%. Global market share of the Beauty segment increased 0.1 points. • Hair Care net sales increased low single digits. Negative impact of a low single digit decrease in volume was more than offset by increased pricing and favorable mix (due to a higher proportion of premium products, which have higher than category-average selling prices). Organic sales increased low single digits. Volume decreased mid-single digits in IMEA (due to competitive activity) and decreased low single digits in Greater China (due to retailer inventory reductions and market slowdown in traditional retailers where our shares are disproportionately higher, versus social commerce retailers) and in Latin America (following increased pricing and due to competitive activity). This was partially offset by a low single digit volume increase in Europe, due to market growth versus the prior year period negatively impacted by the pandemic. Excluding the impacts of the acquisitions, volume in North America decreased low single digits. Global market share of the Hair Care category decreased less than a point. • Skin and Personal Care net sales increased mid-single digits. Positive impacts of a low single digit increase in volume, increased pricing and favorable foreign exchange were partially offset by negative category mix due to a lower proportion of SK-II brand (which has higher than category-average selling prices). Organic sales increased low single digits. Volume increased mid-teens in Latin America (due to market growth), increased mid-single digits in North America (due to innovation and market growth) and increased low single digits in Greater China (due to market growth). Excluding the impacts of the acquisitions, volume in North America increased low single digits. Global market share of the Skin and Personal Care category increased nearly half a point. Net earnings increased 3% to $2.6 billion due to the increase in net sales, partially offset by a 10 basis-point decrease in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin decreased due primarily to a reduction in gross margin, partially offset by a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of sales. The gross margin reduction was driven by increased commodity and transportation costs and negative product mix caused by a lower proportion of sales of SK-II products (which have higher than segment-average gross margins), partially offset by increased pricing and manufacturing cost savings. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased as the positive scale benefits of the net sales increase and a decrease in media spending were partially offset by an increase in overhead costs. Grooming Three months ended March 31, 2022 compared with three months ended March 31, 2021 Grooming net sales increased 3% to $1.5 billion on a 1% increase in unit volume. Higher pricing increased net sales by 6%. Favorable mix increased net sales by 1% due to disproportionate growth in developed markets, which have higher than segment-average selling prices. Unfavorable foreign exchange decreased net sales by 5%. Organic sales increased 8%. Global market share of the Grooming segment increased 1 point. • Shave Care net sales increased mid-single digits. Positive impacts of a low single digit volume increase, increased pricing and favorable mix (due to growth in developed markets and the disproportionate growth of premium shave products, both of which have higher than category-average selling prices) were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. Organic sales increased double digits. Volume increased mid-single digits in Europe (due to innovation and market growth versus the prior year period that was negatively impacted by the pandemic) and in Asia Pacific (due to market growth versus the prior year period that was negatively impacted by the pandemic) and increased low single digits in North America (due to innovation and retailer inventory increases to support new product launches) and IMEA (due to market growth). This was partially offset by a high single digit decrease in Greater China (due primarily to market slowdown in traditional retailers where our shares are disproportionally higher, versus social commerce retailers) and a low single digit decrease in Latin America (due to distribution coverage losses in certain markets). Global market share of the Shave Care category increased nearly half a point. • Appliances net sales decreased high single digits as a high single digit decrease in volume and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts were partially offset by favorable mix (due to a higher proportion of premium shavers and stylers, which have higher than category-average selling prices). Organic sales decreased low single digits. Volume decreased approximately 20% in Europe (due to market contraction versus the prior year period that benefited from a pandemic-related consumption increase). This was partially offset by a high teens increase in Asia Pacific (due to innovation) and a mid-teens increase in North America (due to innovation and retailer inventory increases to support new product launches). Global market share of the Appliances category increased more than half a point. Net earnings increased 13% to $290 million due to the increase in net sales and a 170 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin increased due to an increase in gross margin and a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. The gross margin increase was driven by increased pricing and manufacturing cost savings, partially offset by negative mix caused by the launch and growth of premium-priced, profit-accretive products that have lower than segment-average gross margins. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase. The higher effective tax rate was driven by disproportionate growth in North America, which has higher than Company-average tax rates. Nine months ended March 31, 2022 compared with nine months ended March 31, 2021 Grooming net sales increased 4% to $5.0 billion on a 1% increase in unit volume. Higher pricing increased net sales by 4%. Favorable mix increased net sales by 1% due to growth in North America and the disproportionate growth of premium products, both of which have higher than segment-average selling prices. Unfavorable foreign exchange decreased net sales by 2%. Organic sales increased 6%. Global market share of the Grooming segment increased 1 point. • Shave Care net sales increased mid-single digits. Positive impacts of a low single digit volume increase, increased pricing and positive mix (due primarily to the growth in North America and the disproportionate growth of premium shave products, both of which have higher than category-average selling prices) were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. Organic sales increased high single digits. Volume increased high single digits in North America (due to innovation) and low single digits in Europe (due to innovation and market growth versus the prior year period that was negatively impacted by the pandemic). This was partially offset by a double-digit decline in Greater China (due to market slowdown in traditional retailers where our shares are disproportionally higher, versus social commerce retailers). Global market share of the Shave Care category increased nearly half a point. • Appliances net sales decreased low single digits. Negative impacts of a mid-single digit decline in volume and unfavorable foreign exchange were partially offset by increased pricing and positive mix (due to a higher proportion of premium shavers and epilators, which have higher than category-average selling prices). Organic sales were unchanged. Volume declined high single digits in Europe, mid-single digits in North America and low single digits in Asia Pacific, all due to market contraction versus the prior year period that benefited from pandemic-related consumption increases. Global market share of the Appliances category increased more than half a point. Net earnings increased 11% to $1.2 billion due to the increase in net sales and a 140 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. The net earnings margin increased due to an increase in gross margin and a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. The gross margin increase was driven by increased pricing and manufacturing cost savings, partially offset by negative mix caused by the launch and growth of premium-priced, profit-accretive products that have lower than segment-average gross margins. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase. The higher effective tax rate was driven by disproportionate growth in North America, which has higher than Company-average tax rates. Health Care Three months ended March 31, 2022 compared with three months ended March 31, 2021 Health Care net sales increased 13% to $2.7 billion on an 8% increase in unit volume. Favorable mix increased net sales by 5% due to the disproportionate growth in North America and the Personal Health Care category, both of which have higher than segment-average selling prices. Higher pricing increased net sales by 3%. Unfavorable foreign exchange decreased net sales by 3%. Organic sales increased 16%. Global market share of the Health Care segment decreased 0.5 points. • Oral Care net sales increased low single digits. Positive impacts of a low single digit increase in volume, increased pricing and positive mix (due to a higher proportion of sales in developed markets and the disproportionate growth of premium paste and power brush products, all of which have higher than category-average selling prices) were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. Organic sales increased high single digits. Volume increased more than 20% in Asia Pacific (due to distribution gains and market growth) and increased mid-single digits in North America (due to premium innovation) and Latin America (due to market growth). This volume increase was partially offset by a mid-teens decrease in Greater China (due to slowdown of the power brush market and pandemic-related lockdowns), a high single digit decrease in IMEA (due to competitive activity) and a low single digit decrease in Europe (following increased pricing in certain markets). Global market share of the Oral Care category increased nearly half a point. • Personal Health Care net sales increased more than 20%. This was due primarily to a more than 20% increase in volume, increased pricing and positive mix (due to the disproportionate growth in North America and respiratory products, both of which have higher than category-average selling prices), partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Organic sales increased more than 30%. Volume increased in all regions led by a more than 30% increase in North America (due primarily to a stronger cough, cold and flu season in the current period, and innovation), a more than 20% increase in IMEA, a double digit increase in Latin America (both due to increased marketing and innovation) and a high single digit increase in Europe (due to a stronger cough, cold and flu season in the current period). Global market share of the Personal Health Care category increased slightly. Net earnings increased 29% to $485 million due to the increase in net sales and a 220 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin increased due primarily to a decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by a decrease in gross margin and a higher effective tax rate . The decrease in gross margin was driven by increased commodity and transportation costs and other cost increases associated with the global chip shortage, partially offset by increased pricing and positive mix caused by the disproportionate growth of respiratory products that have higher than segment-average gross margins. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased due primarily to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase. The higher effective tax rate was driven by disproportionate growth in North America, which has higher than Company-average tax rates. Nine months ended March 31, 2022 compared with nine months ended March 31, 2021 Health Care net sales increased 10% to $8.3 billion on a 5% increase in unit volume. Favorable mix increased net sales by 3% due to the disproportionate growth in North America and the Personal Health Care category, both of which have higher than segment-average selling prices. Pricing increased net sales by 2%. Foreign exchange had neutral impacts to net sales. Organic sales also increased 10%. Global market share of the Health Care segment decreased 0.1 points. • Oral Care net sales increased low single digits on unit volume that was unchanged. Positive impacts from favorable mix (due to growth in North America and a higher proportion of premium tier products, both of which have higher than category-average selling prices) and increased pricing were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. Organic sales increased mid-single digits. Volume increased double digits in Asia Pacific (due to distribution gains and market growth), increased mid-single digits in North America and increased low single digits in IMEA (both due to market growth and innovation). This volume increase was fully offset by a double digit decrease in Greater China (due to slowdown of the power brush market and pandemic-related lockdowns) and a mid-single digit decline in Europe (due primarily to supply constraints as a result of the global chip shortage). Global market share of the Oral Care category increased more than half a point. • Personal Health Care net sales increased more than 20%. This was due primarily to a high-teens increase in volume, increased pricing and positive mix (due to the disproportionate growth in North America and respiratory products, both of which have higher than category-average selling prices), partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Organic sales increased more than 20% on a mid-teens increase in organic volume. Volume increased more than 20% in North America and increased double digits in Europe (both due primarily to a stronger cough, cold and flu season in the current period) and in IMEA (due to innovation, increased marketing and distribution gains). Global market share of the Personal Health Care category increased nearly half a point. Net earnings increased 10% to $1.7 billion due primarily to the increase in net sales. Net earnings margin was unchanged as a decrease in gross margin and a higher effective tax rate were offset by a decrease in SG&A as a per centage of net sal es. The decrease in gross margin was driven primarily by increased commodity and transportation costs and other cost increases associated with the global chip shortage, partially offset by increased pricing. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase. The higher effective tax rate was driven by disproportionate growth in North America, which has higher than Company-average tax rates. Fabric & Home Care Three months ended March 31, 2022 compared with three months ended March 31, 2021 Fabric & Home Care net sales increased 7% to $6.7 billion on a 4% increase in unit volume. Higher pricing increased net sales by 5%. Favorable mix increased net sales by 1% due to a higher proportion of sales in North America and the disproportionate growth of premium products, both of which have higher than segment-average selling prices. Unfavorable foreign exchange decreased net sales by 3%. Organic sales increased 10%. Global market share of the Fabric & Home Care segment increased 1.8 points. • Fabric Care net sales increased double digits due primarily to a mid-single digit increase in volume, increased pricing and positive mix (due to a higher proportion of sales in North America and the disproportionate growth of fabric enhancers and premium forms, all of which have higher than category-average selling prices) partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Organic sales increased double digits. Volume increased double digits in Latin America (due to market growth), increased high single digits in North America (due to innovation) and increased low single digits in Europe (due to innovation and market growth versus the prior year period that was negatively impacted by the pandemic) and in Asia Pacific (due to innovation). Global market share of the Fabric Care category increased more than a point. • Home Care net sales increased low single digits on unit volume that was unchanged due to increased pricing and positive mix (due to a higher proportion of sales in North America and premium products, all of which have higher than category-average selling prices), partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Organic sales increased mid-single digits. Volume increased high single digits in Latin America and increased low single digits in North America, both due to innovation. This increase was fully offset by a more than 20% decline in IMEA (due to lower shipments following increased pricing) and a low single digit decline in Europe (due to market contraction versus the prior year period that benefited from a pandemic-related consumption increase). Global market share of the Home Care category increased by nearly two points. Net earnings decreased 6% to $1.0 billion as the increase in net sales was more than offset by a 190 basis-point reduction in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin decreased due primarily to a reduction in gross margin, partially offset by a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. The gross margin decrease was driven by an increase in commodity and transportation costs, and unfavorable mix caused by the growth of premium-priced, profit-accretive products that have lower than segment-average gross margins, partially offset by increased pricing. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased due to the positive scale benefits of the net sales increase and a reduction in marketing spend. Nine months ended March 31, 2022 compared with nine months ended March 31, 2021 Fabric & Home Care net sales increased 7% to $20.7 billion on a 4% increase in unit volume. Higher pricing increased net sales by 3%. Unfavorable foreign exchange decreased net sales by 1%. Organic sales increased 8%. Global market share of the Fabric & Home Care segment increased 1.7 points. • Fabric Care net sales increased high single digits. The positive impacts of a mid-single digit increase in volume, increased pricing and positive mix (due to the disproportionate growth in North America and growth of fabric enhancers and premium forms, all of which have higher than category-average selling prices) were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. Organic sales increased double digits. Volume increased in all regions led by double digit increases in North America and Latin America, and low single digit increases in Europe and in Asia Pacific, all due to market growth and innovation. Global market share of the Fabric Care category increased more than a point. • Home Care net sales increased low single digits on unit volume that was unchanged. Positive impact of increased pricing was partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Organic sales also increased low single digits. Volume increased low single digits in Europe due to innovation. This was fully offset by a more than 20% decline in IMEA (due to market contraction and competitive activity). Global market share of the Home Care category increased more than a point. Net earnings decreased 9% to $3.3 billion as the increase in net sales was more than offset by a 280 basis-point reduction in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin decreased due primarily to a reduction in gross margin, partially offset by a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. The gross margin decrease was primarily driven by an increase in commodity and transportation costs, and unfavorable mix caused by the growth of premium-priced, profit-accretive products that have lower than segment-average gross margins, partially offset by increased pricing. SG&A as a percentage of net sales declined due primarily to the positive scale benefits of the net sales increase. Baby, Feminine & Family Care Three months ended March 31, 2022 compared with three months ended March 31, 2021 Baby, Feminine & Family Care net sales increased 7% to $4.9 billion on a 2% increase in unit volume. Higher pricing increased net sales by 5%. Favorable mix increased net sales by 2% due to the growth of premium products and the North America region, both of which have higher than segment-average selling prices. Unfavorable foreign exchange decreased net sales by 3%. Organic sales increased 10%. Global market share of the Baby, Feminine & Family Care segment increased 1 point. • Baby Care net sales increased high single digits. Positive impacts of a low single digit increase in volume, increased pricing and positive mix (due to a higher proportion of sales in North America and the growth of premium pants and taped diaper products, all of which have higher than category-average selling prices) were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. Organic sales increased double digits. Volume increased high single digits in Europe (due to market growth) and increased mid-single digits in North America (due to market growth and better on-shelf availability versus competitors). This was partially offset by a high teens decline in Greater China (due to competitive activity) and a low single digit decline in IMEA (due to market contraction). Global market share of the Baby Care category increased nearly a point. • Feminine Care net sales increased high single digits. Positive impacts of a mid-single digit increase in volume, increased pricing and positive mix (due to a higher proportion of sales in North America and the growth of premium products including adult incontinence, both of which have higher than category-average selling prices) were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. Organic sales increased double digits. Volume increased high single digits in Europe (due to market growth versus the prior year period that was negatively impacted by the pandemic), increased mid-single digits in North America (due to innovation and distribution gains) and increased low single digits in IMEA (due to market growth). Global market share of the Feminine Care category increased more than a point. • Net sales in Family Care, which is predominantly a North American business, increased mid-single digits on a low single digit increase in volume (due to restocking of retailer inventories) and increased pricing (net of higher promotional spending versus the prior year period with low promotional activity due to the pandemic). Organic sales also increased mid-single digits. North America share of the Family Care category increased more than half a point. Net earnings decreased 4% to $836 million as the increase in net sales was more than offset by a 200 basis-point decrease in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin decreased primarily due to a decrease in gross margin, partially offset by lower SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin decreased primarily due to an increase in commodity and transportation costs, and unfavorable mix caused by the growth of Family Care large count packs and club volume that have lower than segment-average gross margins, partially offset by increased pricing. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased due to the positive scale benefits of the net sales increase and reductions in both marketing and overhead costs. Nine months ended March 31, 2022 compared with nine months ended March 31, 2021 Baby, Feminine & Family Care net sales increased 5% to $14.9 billion on a 2% increase in unit volume. Higher pricing increased net sales by 3%. Favorable mix increased net sales by 1% due to the disproportionate growth in North America and growth of premium tier products, both of which have higher than segment-average selling prices. Unfavorable foreign exchange decreased net sales by 1%. Organic sales increased 6%. Global market share of the Baby, Feminine & Family Care segment increased 0.9 points. • Baby Care net sales increased high single digits. Positive impacts of a low single digit increase in volume, positive mix (due to the growth of premium pants and taped diaper products, both of which have higher than category-average selling prices) and increased pricing were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange. Organic sales increased high single digits. Volume increased high single digits in Latin America (due to innovation), increased mid-single digits in Europe (due to market growth) and increased low single digits in North America (due to market growth and better on-shelf availability versus competitors). This increase was partially offset by a mid-teens decline in Greater China, due to competitive activity. Global market share of the Baby Care category increased half a point. • Feminine Care net sales increased high single digits due to a low single digit increase in volume, increased pricing, and favorable mix (due to the disproportionate growth in North America and the growth of premium adult incontinence, pads and tampons, all of which have higher than category-average selling prices). Organic sales increased double digits. Volume increased high single digits in North America (due to innovation, distribution gains and market growth) and low single digits in Europe (due to market growth versus the prior year period negatively impacted by the pandemic). This increase was partially offset by a low single digit decrease in IMEA (due to market contraction). Global market share of the Feminine Care category increased more than a point. • Net sales in Family Care, which is predominantly a North American business, were unchanged. Positive impacts of a low single digit increase in volume and increased pricing were fully offset by unfavorable mix (caused by disproportionate growth of large count packs, which have lower than category-average selling prices). Organic sales also were unchanged. North America share of the Family Care category increased more than a point. Net earnings decreased 12% to $2.6 billion as the increase in net sales was more than offset by a 330 basis-point decrease in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin decreased primarily due to a decrease in gross margin, partially offset by lower SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin decreased primarily due to an increase in commodity and transportation costs, and unfavorable mix caused by the growth of Family Care large count packs and club volume, both of which have lower than segment-average gross margins, partially offset by increased pricing. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased due to the positive scale benefits of the net sales increase and reductions in both marketing and overhead costs. Corporate Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business segments. These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level; financing and investing activities; certain employee benefit costs; other general corporate items; the gains and losses related to certain divested brands and categories; and certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the reportable segments to U.S. GAAP. The most significant reconciling item relates to income taxes, to adjust from blended statutory rates that are reflected in the reportable segments to the overall Company effective tax rate. Corporate net sales improved by $95 million to $215 million for the quarter and improved by $189 million to $505 million for the fiscal year to date, both due to an increase in sales of incidental businesses managed at the corporate level. Corporate net earnings improved by $2 million to $143 million for the quarter. For the fiscal year to date period, Corporate net earnings improved by $616 million to $382 million, due primarily to the prior year period loss on the early debt extinguishment, net sales growth, current period tax benefits (primarily higher excess tax benefits of share-based compensation) and lower interest expense, partially offset by increased commodity costs tied to the aforementioned incidental businesses and higher foreign exchange transactional charges. LIQUIDITY & CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating Activities We generated $13.0 billion of cash from operating activities fiscal year to date, a decrease of $1.2 billion versus the prior year period. Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, deferred income taxes and gain on sale of assets), generated $13.9 billion of operating cash flow. Working capital and other impacts used $865 million of cash in the period. Accounts receivable increased, using $916 million of cash, driven by sales growth across regions. Days sales outstanding increased by two days. Inventory increased, consuming $1.3 billion of cash driven by increased commodity costs and increased safety stock levels to strengthen supply chain sufficiency amidst business growth. Days on hand increased by three days. Accounts payable, accrued and other net operating assets and liabilities increased, generating $1.3 billion of cash, driven by an increase in trade payables in line with the increase in inventory and commodity costs and, to a lesser extent, the impact of extended payment terms with suppliers. This was partially offset by the payment of prior fiscal year-end incentive compensation and other salary-related accruals. Days payable outstanding decreased by two days. Investing Activities Investing activities used $3.7 billion of cash fiscal year to date driven by capital expenditures and acquisitions. Financing Activities Financing activities used $10.7 billion of net cash fiscal year to date. We used $8.8 billion for treasury stock purchases and $6.5 billion for dividends. We generated $2.7 billion from net debt increases and $1.8 billion from the exercise of stock options and other impacts. As of March 31, 2022, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $11.0 billion. We have short- and long-term debt to meet our financing needs. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements. RECONCILIATION OF MEASURES NOT DEFINED BY U.S. GAAP In accordance with the SEC's Regulation S-K Item 10(e), the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measure. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful perspective on underlying business trends and provide a supplemental measure of period-to-period financial results. Disclosing these non-GAAP financial measures allows investors and management to view our operating results excluding the impact of items that are not reflective of the underlying operating performance. Management uses these non-GAAP measures in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. Certain of these measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures do not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. Therefore, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Organic sales growth: Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. This measure is used in assessing achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. Adjusted free cash flow: Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the U.S. Tax Act (the Company incurred a transitional tax liability of approximately $3.8 billion in fiscal 2018 from the U.S. Tax Act of 2017, which is payable over a period of 8 years). Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. Management views adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments. Adjusted free cash flow productivity: Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings. Management views adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G’s ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. This measure is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. The Company's long-term target is to generate annual adjusted free cash flow productivity at or above 90 percent. Core EPS: Core earnings per share, or Core EPS, is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share excluding items that are not judged to be part of the Company's sustainable results or trends. Management views this non-GAAP measure as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time. This measure is also used when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation. The Core earnings measures included in the following reconciliation tables refer to the equivalent GAAP measures adjusted as applicable for the following item: Early debt extinguishment charges: In the three months ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded after tax charges of $427 million ($512 million before tax), due to early extinguishment of certain long-term debt. These charges represent the difference between the reacquisition price and the par value of the debt extinguished. We do not view the above item to be part of our sustainable results and its exclusion from Core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results. This item is also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation.

See accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Basis of Presentation These statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of The Procter & Gamble Company and subsidiaries (the ""Company,"" ""Procter & Gamble,"" ""P&G,"" ""we"" or ""our"") contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods reported. However, the results of operations included in such financial statements may not necessarily be indicative of annual results. Beginning in fiscal year 2022, the Company began to present increases and reductions in short-term debt with maturities of more than three months separately within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The presentation for the six months ended December 31, 2020 has been revised to align with the current period presentation. This change had no impact on total financing activities and we have concluded the change is not material. 2. New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") No. 2020-04, ""Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting"". The amendments provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-01, ""Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope"", which clarified that certain optional expedients and exceptions in Topic 848 apply to derivative instruments that are affected by the discounting transition due to reference rate reform. These ASUs were effective upon issuance and may be applied prospectively to contract modifications and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated through December 31, 2022. We have completed our evaluation of significant contracts and the guidance has not had, and is not expected to have, a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. Specific elections of expedients and exceptions provided under the ASUs will be made when contract modifications in response to reference rate reform commence. In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, ""Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance"". This guidance requires annual disclosures for transactions with a government authority that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution model. These amendments are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted. We plan to adopt the standard for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023. We are currently assessing the impact of this guidance on our Consolidated Financial Statements and disclosures. No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had, or is expected to have, a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 3. Segment Information Under U.S. GAAP, our operating segments are aggregated into five reportable segments: 1) Beauty, 2) Grooming, 3) Health Care, 4) Fabric & Home Care and 5) Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Our five reportable segments are comprised of: • Beauty : Hair Care (Conditioners, Shampoos, Styling Aids, Treatments); Skin and Personal Care (Antiperspirants and Deodorants, Personal Cleansing, Skin Care); • Grooming : Shave Care (Female Blades & Razors, Male Blades & Razors, Pre- and Post-Shave Products, Other Shave Care); Appliances; • Health Care : Oral Care (Toothbrushes, Toothpaste, Other Oral Care); Personal Health Care (Gastrointestinal, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements, Pain Relief, Other Personal Health Care); • Fabric & Home Care : Fabric Care (Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Additives, Laundry Detergents); Home Care (Air Care, Dish Care, P&G Professional, Surface Care); and • Baby, Feminine & Family Care : Baby Care (Baby Wipes, Taped Diapers and Pants); Feminine Care (Adult Incontinence, Feminine Care); Family Care (Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper).

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill is allocated by reportable segment as follows: Beauty Grooming Health Care Fabric & Home Care Baby, Feminine & Family Care Total Company Goodwill at June 30, 2021 $ 13,257 $ 13,095 $ 8,046 $ 1,873 $ 4,653 $ 40,924 Acquisitions and divestitures 188 — 1 — — 189 Translation and other ( 288 ) ( 200 ) ( 194 ) ( 26 ) ( 90 ) ( 798 ) Goodwill at December 31, 2021 $ 13,157 $ 12,895 $ 7,853 $ 1,847 $ 4,563 $ 40,315 Goodwill decreased from June 30, 2021 due to currency translation, partially offset by acquisitions in Beauty and Health Care. Identifiable intangible assets at December 31, 2021 were comprised of: Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Intangible assets with determinable lives $ 8,688 $ ( 6,198 ) Intangible assets with indefinite lives 21,048 — Total identifiable intangible assets $ 29,736 $ ( 6,198 ) Intangible assets with determinable lives consist of brands, patents, technology and customer relationships. The intangible assets with indefinite lives primarily consist of brands. The amortization expense of determinable-lived intangible assets for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $ 74 million and $ 79 million, respectively. For the six months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the amortization expense was $ 151 million and $ 163 million, respectively. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment by comparing the estimated fair values of our reporting units and underlying indefinite-lived intangible assets to their respective carrying values. We typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of these assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. If the resulting fair value is less than the asset's carrying value, that difference represents an impairment. Our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets occurs during the three months ended December 31. The business unit valuations used to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment depend on a number of significant estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment, margin expansion and Company business plans. We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable. However, future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount rates, tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. To the extent changes in such factors result in a failure to achieve the level of projected cash flows initially used to estimate fair value for purposes of establishing or subsequently impairing the carrying amount of goodwill and related intangible assets, we may need to record non-cash impairment charges in the future. Most of our goodwill reporting units are comprised of a combination of legacy and acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that, at a minimum, exceed three times their underlying carrying values. Certain of our goodwill reporting units, in particular Shave Care and Appliances, are comprised entirely of acquired businesses and as a result, have historically had fair value cushions that are not as high. The Appliances reporting unit has a fair value that significantly exceeds the underlying carrying value. As previously disclosed, the carrying values of the Shave Care reporting unit and the related Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset were impaired during the quarter ended June 30, 2019. Based on our impairment testing during the three months ended December 31, 2021, the Shave Care reporting unit fair value exceeded its carrying value by more than 30 % and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset fair value exceeded its carrying value by approximately 5 %. The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the net sales and earnings growth rates (including residual growth rates), the discount rate and the royalty rate. The residual growth rate represents the expected rate at which the Shave Care reporting unit and Gillette brand are expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period. The residual growth rate utilized in our fair value estimates is consistent with the reporting unit and brand operating plans and approximates expected long-term category market growth rates. The residual growth rate depends on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, relative currency exchange rates and business activities that impact market share. As a result, the residual growth rate could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes, devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or an increased competitive environment. The discount rate, which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, such as further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar. Spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the U.S. The royalty rate used to determine the estimated fair value for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is driven by historical and estimated future profitability of the underlying Gillette business. The royalty rate may be impacted by significant adverse changes in long-term operating margins. While management has implemented strategies to address these events, changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that would trigger future impairment charges of the Shave Care reporting unit's goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. The duration and severity of the pandemic could also result in future impairment charges for the Shave Care reporting unit goodwill and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset. While we have concluded that no impairment exists based on our annual testing during the quarter ended December 31, 2021, the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is most susceptible to future impairment risk. Our assessment of the Gillette intangible asset assumes the net sales growth rates will continue to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic during the current fiscal year. There continues to be a high level of uncertainty relating to how the pandemic will evolve, how governments and consumers will react, progress on the distribution of vaccines and whether the pandemic will have a longer-term effect on consumer habits. Accordingly, there continues to be risk related to this key assumption. A more prolonged pandemic recovery period could impact the assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset that are significant enough to trigger an impairment. Net sales and earnings growth rates could be negatively impacted by reductions or changes in demand for our Shave Care products, which may be caused by, among other things: the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine or other travel restrictions, or financial hardship, changes in the use and frequency of grooming products, by shifts in demand away from one or more of our higher priced products to lower priced products, or by impacts of potential supply chain constraints. In addition, relative global and country/regional macroeconomic factors could result in additional and prolonged devaluation of other countries’ currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Finally, the discount rate utilized in our valuation model could be impacted by changes in the underlying interest rates and risk premiums included in the determination of the cost of capital. As of December 31, 2021, the carrying values of the Shave Care goodwill and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset were $ 12.6 billion and $ 14.1 billion, respectively. We performed a sensitivity analysis for the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset as part of our annual impairment testing during the three months ended December 31, 2021, utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the shorter-term and residual growth rates, discount rate and royalty rate to demonstrate the potential impacts to estimated fair values. The table below provides, in isolation, the estimated fair value impacts related to a 25 basis-point increase in the discount rate, a 25 basis-point decrease in our shorter-term and residual growth rates or a 50 basis-point decrease in our royalty rate, some of which would result in an impairment of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset.

Earnings Per Share Basic net earnings per common share are calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble less preferred dividends by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net earnings per common share are calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble by the diluted weighted average number of common shares during the period. The diluted shares include the dilutive effect of stock options and other stock-based awards based on the treasury stock method and the assumed conversion of preferred stock. Net earnings per share were calculated as follows: CONSOLIDATED AMOUNTS Three Months Ended December 31 Six Months Ended December 31 2021 2020 2021 2020 Net earnings $ 4,242 $ 3,887 $ 8,368 $ 8,195 Less: Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 19 33 33 64 Net earnings attributable to P&G (Diluted) 4,223 3,854 8,335 8,131 Less: Preferred dividends 70 66 140 132 Net earnings attributable to P&G available to common shareholders (Basic) $ 4,153 $ 3,788 $ 8,195 $ 7,999 SHARES IN MILLIONS Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 2,413.4 2,475.8 2,420.7 2,481.0 Add: Effect of dilutive securities Convertible preferred shares (1) 79.6 83.1 80.1 83.5 Stock options and other unvested equity awards (2) 51.2 56.5 50.8 55.9 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 2,544.2 2,615.4 2,551.6 2,620.4 NET EARNINGS PER SHARE (3) Basic $ 1.72 $ 1.53 $ 3.39 $ 3.22 Diluted $ 1.66 $ 1.47 $ 3.27 $ 3.10 (1) An overview of preferred shares can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2021.

(3) Net earnings per share are calculated on Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble. 6. Share-Based Compensation and Postretirement Benefits The following table provides a summary of our share-based compensation expense and postretirement benefit costs: Three Months Ended December 31 Six Months Ended December 31 2021 2020 2021 2020 Share-based compensation expense $ 152 $ 165 $ 268 $ 254 Net periodic benefit cost for pension benefits 47 46 95 93 Net periodic benefit credit for other retiree benefits ( 119 ) ( 80 ) ( 222 ) ( 160 ) Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. 7. Risk Management Activities and Fair Value Measurements As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. There have been no significant changes in our risk management policies or activities during the six months ended December 31, 2021. The Company has not changed its valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period. The Company recognizes transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of each quarter. There were no transfers between levels during the periods presented. Also, there was no significant activity within the Level 3 assets and liabilities during the periods presented. There were no significant assets or liabilities that were remeasured at fair value on a non-recurring basis for the six months ended December 31, 2021. Cash equivalents were $ 9.9 billion and $ 9.1 billion as of December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2021, respectively, and are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. Other investments had a fair value of $ 154 and $ 192 as of December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2021, respectively, including equity securities of $ 126 and $ 163 as of December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2021, respectively, and are presented in Other noncurrent assets. Investments are measured at fair value and primarily classified as Level 1 and Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Level 1 are based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets, and Level 2 are based on quoted market prices for similar instruments. There are no material investment balances classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy or using net asset value as a practical expedient. Unrealized losses on equity securities were $ 2 during the three months ended December 31, 2021 and $ 31 during the six months ended December 31, 2021. Unrealized losses on equity securities were not significant for the three and six months ended December 31, 2020. These unrealized losses are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in Other non-operating income/(expense), net. The fair value of long-term debt was $ 28.3 billion and $ 28.8 billion as of December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2021, respectively. This includes the current portion of long-term debt instruments ($ 4.3 billion and $ 3.6 billion as of December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2021, respectively). Certain long-term debt (debt designated as a fair value hedge) is recorded at fair value. All other long-term debt is recorded at amortized cost but is measured at fair value for disclosure purposes. We consider our debt to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Fair values are generally estimated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments. Disclosures about Financial Instruments The notional amounts and fair values of financial instruments used in hedging transactions as of December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2021 are as follows: Notional Amount Fair Value Asset Fair Value (Liability) December 31, 2021 June 30, 2021 December 31, 2021 June 30, 2021 December 31, 2021 June 30, 2021 DERIVATIVES IN FAIR VALUE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Interest rate contracts $ 6,302 $ 7,415 $ 52 $ 146 $ ( 3 ) $ — DERIVATIVES IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Foreign currency interest rate contracts $ 8,530 $ 8,484 $ 348 $ 89 $ ( 2 ) $ ( 94 ) TOTAL DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS $ 14,832 $ 15,899 $ 400 $ 235 $ ( 5 ) $ ( 94 ) DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS Foreign currency contracts $ 6,881 $ 5,060 $ 46 $ 20 $ ( 10 ) $ ( 22 ) TOTAL DERIVATIVES AT FAIR VALUE $ 21,713 $ 20,959 $ 446 $ 255 $ ( 15 ) $ ( 116 ) The fair value of the interest rate derivative asset/(liability) directly offsets the cumulative amount of the fair value hedging adjustment included in the carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation. The carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation, which includes the unamortized discount or premium and the fair value adjustment, was $ 6.3 billion and $ 7.5 billion as of December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2021, respectively. In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges. The carrying value of those debt instruments designated as net investment hedges, which includes the adjustment for the foreign currency transaction gain or loss on those instruments, was $ 12.6 billion and $ 12.0 billion as of December 31, 2021 and June 30, 2021, respectively. The increase in the notional balance of foreign currency contracts not designated as hedging instruments primarily reflects changes in the level of intercompany financing activity during the period. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. All derivative assets are presented in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Other noncurrent assets. All derivative liabilities are presented in Accrued and other liabilities or Other noncurrent liabilities. Changes in the fair value of net investment hedges are recognized in the Foreign currency translation component of Other comprehensive income (OCI). All of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Before tax gains/(losses) on our financial instruments in hedging relationships are categorized as follows: Amount of Gain/(Loss) Recognized in OCI on Derivatives Three Months Ended December 31 Six Months Ended December 31 2021 2020 2021 2020 DERIVATIVES IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS (1) (2) Foreign exchange contracts $ 218 $ (352) $ 426 $ (538) (1) For the derivatives in net investment hedging relationships, the amount of gain excluded from effectiveness testing, which was recognized in earnings, was $ 17 and $ 16 for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The amount of gain excluded from effectiveness testing was $ 32 and $ 30 for the six months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. (2) In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges. The amount of gain recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (AOCI) for such instruments was $ 264 and $( 595 ) for the three months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The amount of gain/(loss) recognized in AOCI for such instruments was $ 567 and $( 1,241 ) for the six months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Amount of Gain/(Loss) Recognized in Earnings Three Months Ended December 31 Six Months Ended December 31 2021 2020 2021 2020 DERIVATIVES IN FAIR VALUE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Interest rate contracts $ ( 61 ) $ ( 2 ) $ ( 97 ) $ 5 DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS Foreign currency contracts $ 54 $ 202 $ 30 $ 308 The gain/(loss) on the derivatives in fair value hedging relationships is fully offset by the mark-to-market impact of the related exposure. These are both recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in Interest expense. The gain/(loss) on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is substantially offset by the currency mark-to-market of the related exposure. These are both recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A). Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. 8. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss) The table below presents the changes in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) attributable to Procter & Gamble (AOCI), including the reclassifications out of AOCI by component: Investment Securities Post-retirement Benefits Foreign Currency Translation Total AOCI Balance at June 30, 2021 $ 15 $ ( 2,963 ) $ ( 10,796 ) $ ( 13,744 ) OCI before reclassifications (1) 6 768 ( 706 ) 68 Amounts reclassified from AOCI into the Consolidated Statements of Earnings (2) 1 111 — 112 Net current period OCI 7 879 ( 706 ) 180 Less: Other comprehensive income/(loss) attributable to non-controlling interests — — — — Balance at December 31, 2021 $ 22 $ ( 2,084 ) $ ( 11,502 ) $ ( 13,564 ) (1) Net of tax expense of $ 2 , $ 243 and $ 234 for gains/losses on investment securities, postretirement benefit items and foreign currency translation, respectively.

Commitments and Contingencies Litigation We are subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental, patent and trademark matters, labor and employment matters and tax. While considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management and our counsel, the ultimate resolution of the various lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior manufacturing and waste disposal practices. Based on currently available information, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of environmental remediation will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Income Tax Uncertainties The Company is present in approximately 70 countries and over 150 taxable jurisdictions and, at any point in time, has 40 – 50 jurisdictional audits underway at various stages of completion. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite our belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitations. Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate. We have tax years open ranging from 2008 and forward. We are generally not able to reliably estimate the ultimate settlement amounts until the close of an audit. Based on information currently available, we anticipate that over the next 12 month period, audit activity could be completed related to uncertain tax positions in multiple jurisdictions for which we have accrued existing liabilities of less than $ 10 , including interest and penalties. Additional information on the Commitments and Contingencies of the Company can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2021. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. Item 2.

A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected herein, is included in the section titled ""Economic Conditions and Uncertainties"" and the section titled ""Risk Factors"" (Part I, Item 1A) of this Form 10-Q. The purpose of Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is to provide an understanding of Procter & Gamble's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. The MD&A is organized into the following sections: • Overview • Summary of Results – Six months ended December 31, 2021 • Economic Conditions and Uncertainties • Results of Operations – Three and Six Months ended December 31, 2021 • Business Segment Discussion – Three and Six Months ended December 31, 2021 • Liquidity and Capital Resources • Reconciliation of Measures Not Defined by U.S. GAAP Throughout the MD&A, we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales and net earnings. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), that include organic sales gr owth, core net earnings per share (Core EPS), adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity. The explanation at the end of the MD&A provides the definition of these non-GAAP measures, details on the use and the derivation of these measures, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition, despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and market consumption in the MD&A are based on a combination of vendor purchased traditional brick-and-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales of our products in dollar terms on a constant currency basis relative to all product sales in the category. The Company measures fiscal year to date market shares through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months as compared to the end of the reporting period. Management also uses unit volume growth to evaluate and explain drivers of changes in net sales. Organic volume growth reflects year-over-year changes in unit volume excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and certain one-time items, if applicable, and is used to explain changes in organic sales. OVERVIEW P&G is a global leader in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world.

The following table provides the percentage of net sales and net earnings by reportable business segment for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021 (excluding net sales and net earnings in Corporate): Three Months Ended December 31, 2021 Six Months Ended December 31, 2021 Net Sales Net Earnings Net Sales Net Earnings Beauty 19% 23% 19% 24% Grooming 9% 11% 9% 11% Health Care 14% 17% 14% 15% Fabric & Home Care 33% 27% 34% 29% Baby, Feminine & Family Care 25% 22% 24% 21% Total Company 100% 100% 100% 100% SUMMARY OF RESULTS The following are highlights of results for the six months ended December 31, 2021 versus the six months ended December 31, 2020: • Net sales increased 6% to $41.3 billion, due to a high single digit increase in Health Care and mid-single digit increases in Beauty, Grooming, Fabric & Home Care and Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, increased 5%. Overall, organic sales increased high single digits in Health Care, increased mid-single digits in Fabric & Home Care, Grooming and Baby, Feminine & Family Care and increased low single digits in Beauty. • Net earnings were $8.4 billion, an increase of $0.2 billion, or 2%, versus the prior year period due to the increase in net sales and a base period loss on early debt extinguishment, partially offset by a decrease in operating margin. • Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble were $8.3 billion, an increase of $0.2 billion, or 3%, versus the prior year. • Diluted net earnings per share (EPS) increased 5% to $3.27 due primarily to the increase in net earnings and a reduction in the weighted average shares outstanding. Net earnings per share were flat versus the prior year period core net earnings per share due to the prior period loss on early debt extinguishment. • Operating cash flow was $9.8 billion. Adjusted free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less capital expenditures and certain other impacts, was $8.3 billion. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 99%. ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES Global Economic Conditions. Our products are sold in numerous countries across North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa, with more than half our sales generated outside the United States. As such, we are exposed to, and impacted by global macroeconomic factors, U.S. and foreign government policies and foreign exchange fluctuations. Global economic conditions continue to be highly volatile due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in market size contractions in certain countries due to economic slowdowns and government restrictions on movement. Other macroeconomic factors also remain dynamic, and any causes of market size contraction, such as greater political unrest or instability in the Middle East, Central & Eastern Europe, certain Latin American markets, the Hong Kong market in Greater China and the Korean peninsula could reduce our sales or erode our operating margin, and consequently reduce our net earnings and cash flows. Changes in Costs. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, transportation costs and our own productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp. Volatility in the market price of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs. Disruptions in our manufacturing, supply and distribution operations, including energy shortages, port congestions, labor constraints and freight container and truck shortages have impacted our costs and could do so in the future. If we are unable to manage these impacts through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions, as well as through consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. Net sales could also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on the consumption of our products. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including outsourcing projects, supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. If we are not successful in executing and sustaining these changes, there could be a negative impact on our gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. Foreign Exchange. We have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates. Translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation of transaction-related working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. In three out of the past four years a number of foreign currencies have weakened versus the U.S. dollar, leading to lower sales and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts. Certain countries that recently had and are currently experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations include Argentina, Turkey, Brazil and Russia. These fluctuations have significantly impacted our historical net sales, costs and net earnings and could do so in the future. Increased pricing in response to certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could also have a negative impact on the consumption of our products, which would negatively affect our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. Government Policies. Our net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government legislative, regulatory or enforcement policies. For example, our net earnings and cash flows could be affected by any future legislative or regulatory changes in U.S. or non-U.S. tax policy, or any significant change in global tax policy adopted under the current work being led by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (""OECD"") for the G20 focused on ""Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy."" The breadth of the OECD project extends beyond pure digital businesses and if agreed and enacted by most countries is likely to impact most large multinational businesses by both redefining jurisdictional taxation rights and broadly establishing a 15% minimum tax on their foreign operations. Our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows may also be impacted by changes in U.S. and foreign government policies related to environmental and climate change matters. Additionally, we attempt to carefully manage our debt, currency and other exposures in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and pricing controls, such as Nigeria, Algeria, Egypt, Argentina and Turkey. Further, our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes to international trade agreements in North America and elsewhere. Changes in government policies in these areas might cause an increase or decrease in our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. COVID-19 Disclosures. Our priorities during the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be in protecting the health and safety of our employees; maximizing the availability of products that help consumers with their health, hygiene and cleaning needs; and using our employees’ talents and our resources to help society meet and overcome the current challenges. Because we sell products that are essential to the daily lives of consumers, the pandemic has not had a materially negative impact to our consolidated net sales, as positive and negative impacts continue to largely offset each other. We further describe these impacts for the period covered by this report in the Business Segment Discussion of the MD&A. The continued evolution of the pandemic and emergence of new variants may result in economic recessions or a slowdown of economic growth in certain countries or globally. This may result in reduced demand for our products that would have a negative impact on our net sales, net earnings and cash flows. It could also lead to volatility in consumer access to our products (due to government actions or key material, transportation and labor shortages impacting our ability to produce and ship products) or could impact consumers’ movements and access to our products. The resumption towards normalcy in economic activity as governmental restrictions are relaxed and economies gradually, partially, or fully reopen in certain regions and markets, could also result in reduced demand due to consumption decreases and consumer pantry destocking (particularly, in home cleaning and hygiene products). Our retail customers are also impacted by the pandemic and their success in addressing issues and maintaining their operations could impact consumer access to and, as a result, sales of our products. We believe that in the long term, there will continue to be strong demand for categories in which we operate, particularly our products that deliver essential health, hygiene and cleaning benefits. However, the uncertainty in the timing and extent of demand volatility, the relaxation and reimplementation of movement restrictions, the timing and impact of potential consumer pantry destocking, and future economic trends due to a resurgence of positive cases, the emergence of new variants of the virus, the speed at which treatments and vaccines are administered and governmental actions in response to the pandemic may result in heightened volatility of net sales, net earnings and cash flows during and subsequent to the pandemic. Business Continuity . Our ability to continue to operate without any significant negative impacts will, in part, depend on our ability to protect our employees and our supply chain. The Company has endeavored to follow the recommendations from governments and health authorities, including on vaccine administration, with specific measures in place for those working in our plants and distribution facilities. We have also worked closely with local and national officials to keep our manufacturing facilities open due to the essential nature of the majority of our products. While we have been able to broadly maintain our operations, we experienced some disruption in our supply chain in certain markets due primarily to the restriction of employee movements, key material and labor shortages, and transportation constraints. We intend to continue to work with our suppliers and government authorities to implement employee safety measures to minimize disruption to the manufacturing and distribution of our products. However, uncertainty in the duration and scope of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants of the virus, the likelihood of a resurgence of positive cases, the speed at which treatments and vaccines are administered and governmental actions in response to the pandemic could result in an unforeseen disruption to our supply chain and impact our operations (for example, the closure of a key manufacturing or distribution facility or the inability of a key material or transportation supplier to source and transport materials). Liquidity . Because the pandemic, thus far, has not had a material negative impact on our operations, on the demand for our products or the resulting net sales and net earnings, it has not negatively impacted the Company’s liquidity position. We continue to generate operating cash flows to meet our short-term liquidity needs and continue to maintain access to capital markets enabled by our strong short- and long-term credit ratings. Impairments . We have not observed any material impairments or other significant reductions in the fair value of our recorded assets due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Three Months Ended December 31, 2021 The following discussion provides a review of results for the three months ended December 31, 2021 versus the three months ended December 31, 2020. Three Months Ended December 31 Amounts in millions, except per share amounts 2021 2020 % Chg Net sales $20,953 $19,745 6% Operating income 5,168 5,380 (4)% Net earnings 4,242 3,887 9% Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 4,223 3,854 10% Diluted net earnings per common share 1.66 1.47 13% Core net earnings per common share 1.66 1.64 1% Three Months Ended December 31 COMPARISONS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES 2021 2020 Basis Pt Chg Gross margin 49.1% 53.1% (400) Selling, general & administrative expense 24.4% 25.9% (150) Operating income 24.7% 27.2% (250) Earnings before income taxes 25.0% 24.7% 30 Net earnings 20.2% 19.7% 50 Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 20.2% 19.5% 70 Net Sales Net sales for the quarter increased 6% to $21.0 billion on a 3% increase in unit volume. Higher pricing increased net sales by 3%. Mix was neutral to net sales, as positive mix from the disproportionate growth of the North America region and the Personal Health Care business, both of which have higher than Company-average selling prices, was offset by the disproportionate growth of Fabric Care, which has lower than Company-average selling price. Foreign exchange had no net impact on net sales. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, organic sales also increased 6% on a 3% increase in organic volume. Net sales increased high single digits in Health Care and Fabric & Home Care, increased mid-single digits in Grooming and Baby, Family & Feminine Care and increased low single digits in Beauty. On a regional basis, volume increased mid-single digits in North America and Latin America, and increased low single digits in Europe and Asia Pacific. This increase was partially offset by low single digit decreases in Greater China and IMEA.

(2) Other includes the sales mix impact from acquisitions and divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile volume to net sales. Operating Costs Gross margin decreased 400 basis points to 49.1% of net sales for the quarter. The decrease in gross margin was due to: • 400 basis points of increased commodity costs and • a 140 basis-point decline from unfavorable mix, primarily due to negative product mix resulting from the launch and growth of premium-priced products that are profit-accretive but have lower than Company-average gross margin. These impacts were partially offset by: • a 130 basis-point increase due to higher pricing and • 10 basis points of benefit from favorable foreign exchange impacts. Net manufacturing productivity savings had no impact on gross margin as 80 basis points of gross savings were fully offset by 60 basis points of increased transportation costs and 20 basis points of product and packaging investments. Total SG&A was unchanged at $5.1 billion, as a decline in overhead costs was offset by an increase in other operating costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 150 basis points to 24.4% due primarily to decreases in both marketing and overhead costs as a percentage of sales. Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales decreased 80 basis points primarily due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and productivity savings, partially offset by inflation and other cost increases. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 80 basis points due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase. Other operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 10 basis points due to increased foreign exchange transactional charges. Productivity-driven cost savings delivered 70 basis points of benefit to SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Non-Operating Expenses and Income Interest expense was $106 million for the quarter, a $37 million decrease versus the prior year period, driven by lower average interest rates. Interest income was $10 million for the quarter, a $1 million increase versus the prior year period. Other non-operating income was $167 million, an improvement of $536 million due to a prior period loss on early-debt extinguishment, a current period gain on the divestiture of minor brands and a current period increase in net non-operating benefits on defined benefit retirement plans, partially offset by current period unrealized losses on equity investments. Income Taxes For the three months ended December 31, 2021, the effective tax rate decreased 125 basis points versus the prior year period to 19.0% due to: • a 105 basis-point decrease from higher excess tax benefits of share-based compensation (a 195 basis-point benefit in the current period versus a 90 basis-point benefit in the prior year period), • a 35 basis-point decrease from the impact of the early extinguishment of debt in the prior period and • a 25 basis-point decrease from favorable impacts from the geographic mix of current year earnings. These decreases were partially offset by a 40 basis-point increase from discrete impacts related to uncertain tax positions (a 10 basis-point unfavorable impact in the current year versus a 30 basis-point favorable impact in the prior year period). Net Earnings Operating income decreased $0.2 billion, or 4%, to $5.2 billion for the quarter, as the increase in net sales was more than offset by the decrease in operating margin, the components of which are described above. Net earnings increased $0.4 billion, or 9%, to $4.2 billion as the increase in other non-operating income and decrease in effective income tax rate more than offset the decrease in operating income. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of approximately $43 million on net earnings for the quarter, including both transactional and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars. Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $0.4 billion or, 10%, to $4.2 billion for the quarter. Diluted net earnings per share of $1.66 increased by 13% versus the base period due to the increase in net earnings and a reduction in the weighted average number of shares outstanding. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Six Months Ended December 31, 2021 The following discussion provides a review of results for the six months ended December 31, 2021 versus the six months ended December 31, 2020. Six Months Ended December 31 Amounts in millions, except per share amounts 2021 2020 % Chg Net sales $41,291 $39,063 6% Operating income 10,191 10,661 (4)% Net earnings 8,368 8,195 2% Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 8,335 8,131 3% Diluted net earnings per common share 3.27 3.10 5% Core net earnings per common share 3.27 3.27 — Six Months Ended December 31 COMPARISONS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES 2021 2020 Basis Pt Chg Gross margin 49.1% 52.9% (380) Selling, general & administrative expense 24.4% 25.6% (120) Operating income 24.7% 27.3% (260) Earnings before income taxes 24.9% 26.0% (110) Net earnings 20.3% 21.0% (70) Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 20.2% 20.8% (60) Net Sales Net sales for the period increased 6% to $41.3 billion on a 2% increase in unit volume. Higher pricing increased net sales by 2%. Positive mix increased net sales by 1% driven by the disproportionate growth of the North America region and the Personal Health Care business, both of which have higher than Company-average selling prices. This was partially offset by the disproportionate growth of the Fabric Care business, which has lower than Company-average selling price. Favorable foreign exchange had a 1% positive impact on net sales. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, organic sales increased 5%. Net sales increased high single digits in Health Care and increased mid-single digits in Beauty, Grooming, Fabric & Home Care and Baby, Feminine & Family Care. On a regional basis, volume increased mid-single digits in North America and Latin America and low single digits in Europe, partially offset by low single digit decreases in Greater China and IMEA.

(2) Other includes the sales mix impact from acquisitions and divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile volume to net sales. Operating Costs Gross margin decreased 380 basis points to 49.1% of net sales for the period. The decrease in gross margin was due to: • 370 basis points of increased commodity costs and • a 120 basis-point decline from unfavorable mix, primarily due to negative product mix caused by the launch and disproportionate growth of premium-priced products that are profit-accretive but have lower than Company-average gross margin. These impacts were offset by: • an 80 basis-point increase due to higher pricing, • 20 basis points of benefit from favorable foreign exchange impacts and • 10 basis points of net manufacturing productivity savings (80 basis points of gross savings, partially offset by 50 basis points of increased transportation impacts and 20 basis points of product and packaging investments and other impacts). Total SG&A spending increased 1% to $10.1 billion due to increased marketing spending, partially offset by decreases in other operating costs and overhead costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 120 basis points to 24.4% primarily due to decreases in both overhead costs and marketing spending as a percentage of net sales. Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales decreased 70 basis points primarily due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and productivity savings, partially offset by inflation and other cost increases. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 40 basis points due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and savings in agency compensation, production costs and advertising spending, partially offset by increased media spending. Other operating expenses as a percentage of net sales remained flat as a gain on the sale of operating real estate was offset by increased foreign exchange transactional charges. Productivity-driven cost savings delivered 80 basis points of benefit to SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Non-Operating Expenses and Income Interest expense was $215 million for the period, a $64 million decrease versus the prior year period driven by lower average interest rates. Interest income was $21 million for the quarter, a $2 million increase versus the prior year period. Net other non-operating income was $277 million, an improvement of $504 million due to a prior period loss on early-debt extinguishment, a current period gain on the sale of minor brands and a current period increase in net non-operating benefits on defined benefit retirement plans, partially offset by current period unrealized losses on equity investments. Income Taxes For the six months ended December 31, 2021, the effective tax rate decreased 90 basis points versus the prior year period to 18.6% due to: • a 40 basis-point decrease from favorable impacts from the geographic mix of current year earnings, • a 20 basis-point decrease from higher excess tax benefits of share-based compensation (a 195 basis-point benefit in the current period versus a 175 basis-point benefit in the prior year period), • a 15 basis-point decrease from discrete impacts related to uncertain tax positions (a 20 basis-point favorable impact in the current year versus a 5 basis-point favorable impact in the prior year period) and • a 15 basis-point decrease from the impact of the early extinguishment of debt in the prior period. Net Earnings Operating income decreased $0.5 billion, or 4%, to $10.2 billion for the fiscal year to date period, as the increase in net sales was more than offset by the decrease in operating margin, the components of which are described above. Net earnings increased $0.2 billion, or 2%, to $8.4 billion for the fiscal year to date period as the decrease in operating income was more than offset by the increase in other non-operating income and the decrease in the effective income tax rate. Foreign exchange had a positive impact of approximately $18 million on net earnings for the period, including both transactional and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars. Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $0.2 billion, or 3%, to $8.3 billion for the fiscal year to date period. Diluted net earnings per share increased 5% to $3.27 versus the base period due to the increase in net earnings and a reduction in the weighted average number of shares outstanding. BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSION – Three and Six Months ended December 31, 2021 The following discussion provides a review of results by reportable business segment. Analysis of the results for the three and six month periods ended December 31, 2021 is provided based on a comparison to the three and six month periods ended December 31, 2020. The primary financial measures used to evaluate segment performance are net sales and net earnings. The table below provides supplemental information on net sales, earnings before income taxes and net earnings by reportable business segment for the three and six months ended December 31, 2021 versus the comparable prior year period (dollar amounts in millions): Three Months Ended December 31, 2021 Net Sales % Change Versus Year Ago Earnings/(Loss) Before Income Taxes % Change Versus Year Ago Net Earnings % Change Versus Year Ago Beauty $ 3,926 3 % $ 1,179 (1) % $ 947 (1) % Grooming 1,811 4 % 576 7 % 476 5 % Health Care 2,976 8 % 905 9 % 701 7 % Fabric & Home Care 6,972 7 % 1,463 (9) % 1,137 (9) % Baby, Feminine & Family Care 5,116 5 % 1,187 (12) % 914 (12) % Corporate 152 N/A (71) N/A 67 N/A Total Company $ 20,953 6 % $ 5,239 7 % $ 4,242 9 % Six Months Ended December 31, 2021 Net Sales % Change Versus Year Ago Earnings/(Loss) Before Income Taxes % Change Versus Year Ago Net Earnings % Change Versus Year Ago Beauty $ 7,890 4 % $ 2,421 — % $ 1,938 — % Grooming 3,498 5 % 1,094 14 % 893 11 % Health Care 5,652 8 % 1,600 6 % 1,230 4 % Fabric & Home Care 13,981 6 % 3,009 (10) % 2,328 (10) % Baby, Feminine & Family Care 9,980 4 % 2,262 (15) % 1,740 (15) % Corporate 290 N/A (112) N/A 239 N/A Total Company $ 41,291 6 % $ 10,274 1 % $ 8,368 2 % Beauty Three months ended December 31, 2021 compared with three months ended December 31, 2020 Beauty net sales increased 3% to $3.9 billion on a 1% increase in unit volume. Higher pricing increased net sales by 2%. Foreign exchange impacts increased net sales by 1%. Organic sales increased 2%. Global market share of the Beauty segment was unchanged. • Hair Care net sales increased low single digits on flat volume due to increased pricing. Organic sales also increased low single digits. Volume increased low single digits in North America (due to market growth in shampoos and conditioners, partially offset by external supply constraints in stylers), in Europe (due to market growth, partially offset by increased competitive activity in certain markets), in Latin America (due to market growth) and in Asia Pacific (due to innovation, partially offset by increased competitive activity in certain markets). This volume increase was offset by a mid-teens decline in IMEA (due primarily to market slowdown) . Global market share of the Hair Care category decreased less than a point. • Skin and Personal Care net sales increased mid-single digits due to a low single digit increase in volume, increased pricing and favorable foreign exchange impacts, partially offset by negative category mix due to disproportionate growth of personal care (which has lower than category-average selling price) and disproportionate growth of SKII brand in travel retail (which has lower than brand-average selling price) caused by pandemic-related lockdowns impacting other channels in Asia. Organic sales increased low single digits. Volume increased mid-single digits in North America (due primarily to innovation and growth in skin care and deodorants) and low single digits in Greater China (due primarily to slower market growth in channels where our market shares are higher, versus other faster-growing online channels). Global market share of the Skin and Personal Care category increased slightly. Net earnings decreased 1% to $947 million as the increase in net sales was more than offset by a 100 basis-point decrease in net earnings margin. The net earnings margin decreased due to a reduction in gross margin, partially offset by a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. The gross margin reduction was driven by increased commodity and freight costs, negative product mix caused by a higher proportion of sales of personal care products (which have lower than segment-average gross margins) and a lower proportion of sales of SKII products (which have higher than segment-average gross margins), partially offset by increased pricing and manufacturing cost savings. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and a reduction in overhead spending. Six months ended December 31, 2021 compared with six months ended December 31, 2020 Beauty net sales increased 4% to $7.9 billion on unit volume that was unchanged. Higher pricing increased net sales by 2%. Foreign exchange impacts increased net sales by 2%. Organic sales increased 2%. Global market share of the Beauty segment was unchanged. • Hair Care net sales increased mid-single digits on flat volume due to increased pricing, favorable foreign exchange impacts and favorable mix caused by a higher proportion of sales of premium tier products including treatments and conditioners, all of which have higher than category-average selling prices. Organic sales increased low single digits. Volume increased low single digits in North America (due to market growth in shampoos and conditioners, partially offset by external supply constraints in stylers) and Europe (due to market recovery versus pandemic-related consumption declines in the base period). This volume increase wa s offset by a mid-single digit decline in IMEA (due to increased competitive activity) and low single digit declines in Greater China (due to trade inventory reductions and slower market growth in channels where our market shares are higher, versus other faster-growing online channels) and Latin America (due to reduced shipments following increased pricing, partially offset by innovation). Global market share of the Hair Care category decreased more than half a point. • Skin and Personal Care net sales increased mid-single digits due to a low single digit increase in volume, increased pricing and favorable foreign exchange impacts, partially offset by negative category mix due to disproportionate growth of personal care (which has lower than category-average selling prices) and disproportionate growth of SKII brand in travel retail (which has lower than brand-average selling prices) caused by pandemic-related lockdowns impacting other channels in Asia. Organic sales increased low single digits. Volume increased double digits in Latin America (due to market recovery following pandemic-related consumption declines in the base period) and increased mid-single digits in Greater China (due primarily to slower market growth in channels where our market shares are higher, versus other faster-growing online channels). This increase was partially offset by a mid-single digit decline in Asia Pacific due to a pandemic-related consumption decrease in the current period. Global market share of the Skin and Personal Care category increased slightly. Net earnings were unchanged at $1.9 billion as the increase in net sales was fully offset by an 80 basis-point decrease in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin decreased due to a reduction in gross margin, partially offset by a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of sales. The gross margin reduction was driven by increased commodity and freight costs, and negative product mix caused by a higher proportion of sales of personal care products (which have lower than segment-average gross margins) and a lower proportion of sales of SKII products (which have higher than segment-average gross margins), partially offset by increased pricing and manufacturing cost savings. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased as the positive scale benefits of the net sales increase was partially offset by an increase in media spending. Grooming Three months ended December 31, 2021 compared with three months ended December 31, 2020 Grooming net sales increased 4% to $1.8 billion on a 1% increase in unit volume. Increased pricing had a positive 4% impact on net sales. Favorable mix had a positive 1% impact on net sales due to the disproportionate growth of the Shave Care business in developed markets (due to pandemic-related consumption decreases in the prior period), which have higher than segment-average selling prices. Unfavorable foreign exchange decreased net sales by 1%. Organic sales increased 5%. Global market share of the Grooming segment increased 1 point. • Shave Care net sales increased mid-single digits due to a low single digit volume increase, increased pricing and favorable mix (due to growth in North America and the disproportionate growth of premium shave systems products, both of which have higher than category-average selling prices), partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Organic sales increased mid-single digits. Volume increased mid-single digits in North America and Europe (due to innovation and market size increases versus a base period that was negatively impacted by the pandemic) and increased low single digits in IMEA (due to innovation) and Asia Pacific (due to retailer inventory increases to support innovation launch). This was partially offset by a mid-teens decrease in Greater China (due primarily to market size decline in offline channels, where our market shares are higher than e-commerce and other emerging online channels) and a mid-single digit decline in Latin America (due to distribution losses in certain markets). Global market share of the Shave Care category increased nearly half a point. • Appliances net sales increased low single digits as a low single digit decrease in volume and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts were more than offset by increased pricing and favorable mix (due to the disproportionate growth of premium shavers and stylers, which have higher than category-average selling prices). Organic sales increased mid-single digits. Volume decreased mid-teens in IMEA, mid-single digits in Asia Pacific and low single digits in North America, all due to a pandemic-related consumption increase of at-home grooming and styling products in the base period. This was partially offset by a high teens increase in Greater China due to innovation on shavers. Global market share of the Appliances category increased half a point. Net earnings increased 5% to $476 million due to the increase in net sales and a 20 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin increased due to a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by a decrease in gross margin and a higher effective tax rate. The gross margin decrease was driven by negative mix caused by the launch of premium-priced, profit-accretive products that have lower than segment-average gross margins, partially offset by the positive impact of increased pricing. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase. The higher effective tax rate was driven by disproportionate growth in North America, which has higher than Company-average tax rates. Six months ended December 31, 2021 compared with six months ended December 31, 2020 Grooming net sales increased 5% to $3.5 billion on a 1% increase in unit volume. Increased pricing had a positive 3% impact on net sales. Favorable mix had a positive 1% impact on net sales due to growth in North America and the disproportionate growth of premium shave systems products, both of which have higher than segment-average selling prices. This was partially offset by the decline of the Appliances business (due to a pandemic-related consumption increase in the base period) which has higher than segment-average selling prices. Foreign exchange had a neutral impact on net sales. Organic sales increased 5%. Global market share of the Grooming segment increased 1 point. • Shave Care net sales increased mid-single digits due to a low single digit volume increase, increased pricing and favorable mix (due to growth in North America and the disproportionate growth of premium shave systems products, both of which have higher than category-average selling prices). Organic sales increased mid-single digits. Volume increased high single digits in North America and low single digits in Europe due to innovation and market size increases versus a base period that was negatively impacted by the pandemic. This was partially offset by a double digit decline in Greater China (due primarily to market size decline in offline channels, where our market shares are higher than e-commerce and other emerging online channels) and a low single digit decline in IMEA (due to reduced promotional activity of lower tier shave products). Global market share of the Shave Care category increased half a point. • Appliances net sales were unchanged as a mid-single digit decline in volume and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts were offset by favorable mix (due to a higher proportion of sales of premium shavers and epilators, which have higher than category-average selling prices) and increased pricing. Organic sales were unchanged. Volume declined double digits in North America, high single digits in Asia Pacific and mid-single digits in Europe, all due to a pandemic-related consumption increase of at-home grooming and styling products in the base period. Global market share of the Appliances category increased more than half a point. Net earnings increased 11% to $893 million due to the increase in net sales and a 130 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. The net earnings margin increased due to an increase in gross margin and a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. The gross margin increase was driven by manufacturing cost savings and increased pricing, partially offset by negative mix caused by the launch of premium-priced, profit-accretive products that have lower than segment-average gross margins. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase. The higher effective tax rate was driven by disproportionate growth in North America, which has higher than Company-average tax rates.

Organic sales increased low single digits. The volume decrease was driven by high single digit declines in Europe (due primarily to power brush related supply constraints resulting from the global chip shortage) and Greater China (due to decline of the power brush market). These volume decreases were partially offset by a high single digit increase in Asia Pacific, mid-single digit increases in North America and Latin America and a low single digit increase in IMEA, all due to market growth and innovation. Global market share of the Oral Care category increased half a point. • Personal Health Care net sales increased about 20% due primarily to a mid-teens increase in volume, along with positive mix impacts from the disproportionate growth of North America and respiratory products, both of which have higher than category-average selling prices, and inflation-related price increases.

Corporate Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business segments. These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level; financing and investing activities; certain employee benefit costs; other general corporate items; the gains and losses related to certain divested brands and categories; and certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the reportable segments to U.S. GAAP. The most significant reconciling item relates to income taxes, to adjust from blended statutory rates that are reflected in the reportable segments to the overall Company effective tax rate. Corporate net sales improved by $50 million to $152 million for the quarter and improved by $94 million to $290 million for the fiscal year to date, both due to an increase in sales of incidental businesses managed at the corporate level. Corporate net earnings improved by $536 million to $67 million for the quarter and improved by $614 million to $239 million for the fiscal year to date, both due primarily to a base period loss on the early debt extinguishment, current period tax benefits (primarily higher excess tax benefits of share-based compensation) and lower interest expense, partially offset by higher foreign exchange transactional charges. LIQUIDITY & CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating Activities We generated $9.8 billion of cash from operating activities fiscal year to date, a decrease of $399 million versus the prior year period. Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, deferred income taxes and gain on sale of assets), generated $9.9 billion of operating cash flow. Working capital and other impacts used $84 million of cash in the period. Accounts receivable increased, using $644 million of cash, primarily due to sales growth. Days sales outstanding increased by one day driven by a higher relative amount of sales towards the end of the quarter. Inventory increased, consuming $840 million of cash primarily due to increased safety stock levels in anticipation of the supply chain challenges, increased commodity costs and business growth. Days on hand were relatively flat at 58. Accounts payable, accrued and other net operating assets and liabilities increased, generating $1.4 billion of cash, primarily driven by an increase in trade payables as a result of increased inventory and transportation costs and, to a lesser extent, the impact of extended payment terms with suppliers. This was partially offset by the payment of prior fiscal year-end incentive compensation and other salary-related accruals. Days payable outstanding is at 84, a reduction of two days versus year ago. Investing Activities Investing activities used $2.0 billion of cash fiscal year to date primarily due to capital expenditures. Financing Activities Financing activities used $6.3 billion of net cash fiscal year to date. We used $7.5 billion for treasury stock purchases and $4.4 billion for dividends. We generated $4.4 billion from net debt increases and $1.2 billion from the exercise of stock options and other impacts. As of December 31, 2021, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $12.5 billion. We have short- and long-term debt to meet our financing needs. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements. RECONCILIATION OF MEASURES NOT DEFINED BY U.S. GAAP In accordance with the SEC's Regulation S-K Item 10(e), the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measure. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful perspective on underlying business trends and provide a supplemental measure of period-to-period financial results. Disclosing these non-GAAP financial measures allows investors and management to view our operating results excluding the impact of items that are not reflective of the underlying operating performance. Management uses these non-GAAP measures in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. Certain of these measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures do not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. Therefore, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Organic sales growth: Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. This measure is used in assessing achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. Adjusted free cash flow: Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the U.S. Tax Act (the Company incurred a transitional tax liability of approximately $3.8 billion in fiscal 2018 from the U.S. Tax Act of 2017, which is payable over a period of 8 years). Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. Management views adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments. Adjusted free cash flow productivity: Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings. Management views adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G’s ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. This measure is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. The Company's long-term target is to generate annual adjusted free cash flow productivity at or above 90 percent. Core EPS: Core earnings per share, or Core EPS, is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share excluding items that are not judged to be part of the Company's sustainable results or trends. Management views this non-GAAP measure as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time. This measure is also used when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation. The Core earnings measures included in the following reconciliation tables refer to the equivalent GAAP measures adjusted as applicable for the following items: Early debt extinguishment charges: In the three months ended December 31, 2020, the company recorded after tax charges of $427 million ($512 million before tax), due to early extinguishment of certain long-term debt. These charges represent the difference between the reacquisition price and the par value of the debt extinguished. We do not view the above item to be part of our sustainable results and their exclusion from Core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results. These items are also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation.

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Basis of Presentation These statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of The Procter & Gamble Company and subsidiaries (the ""Company,"" ""Procter & Gamble,"" ""P&G,"" ""we"" or ""our"") contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods reported. However, the results of operations included in such financial statements may not necessarily be indicative of annual results. For the quarter ended September 30, 2021, the Company began to present increases and reductions in short-term debt with maturities of more than three months separately within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The presentation for the quarter ended September 30, 2020 has been revised to align with the current period presentation. This change had no impact on total financing activities and we have concluded the change is not material. 2. New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (""FASB"") issued Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") No. 2020-04, ""Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting."" The amendments provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP"") to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-01, ""Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope"", which clarified that certain optional expedients and exceptions in Topic 848 apply to derivative instruments that are affected by the discounting transition due to reference rate reform. These ASUs were effective upon issuance and may be applied prospectively to contract modifications and hedging relationships entered or evaluated through December 31, 2022. We are currently evaluating our contracts and do not expect a material impact at this time. Specific elections of expedients and exceptions provided under the ASUs will be made when contract modifications in response to reference rate reform commence. No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had, or is expected to have, a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 3. Segment Information Under U.S. GAAP, our operating segments are aggregated into five reportable segments: 1) Beauty, 2) Grooming, 3) Health Care, 4) Fabric & Home Care and 5) Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Our five reportable segments are comprised of: • Beauty : Hair Care (Conditioners, Shampoos, Styling Aids, Treatments); Skin and Personal Care (Antiperspirants and Deodorants, Personal Cleansing, Skin Care); • Grooming : Shave Care (Female Blades & Razors, Male Blades & Razors, Pre- and Post-Shave Products, Other Shave Care); Appliances; • Health Care : Oral Care (Toothbrushes, Toothpaste, Other Oral Care); Personal Health Care (Gastrointestinal, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements, Pain Relief, Other Personal Health Care); • Fabric & Home Care : Fabric Care (Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Additives, Laundry Detergents); Home Care (Air Care, Dish Care, P&G Professional, Surface Care); and • Baby, Feminine & Family Care : Baby Care (Baby Wipes, Taped Diapers and Pants); Feminine Care (Adult Incontinence, Feminine Care); Family Care (Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper). Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. Our operating segments are comprised of similar product categories. Operating segments that individually accounted for 5% or more of consolidated net sales are as follows: % of Net sales by operating segment (1) Three Months Ended September 30 2021 2020 Fabric Care 23 % 22 % Home Care 11 % 12 % Baby Care 10 % 10 % Skin and Personal Care 10 % 10 % Hair Care 10 % 10 % Family Care 8 % 9 % Oral Care 8 % 8 % Shave Care 7 % 6 % Feminine Care 6 % 6 % Personal Health Care 5 % 5 % Other 2 % 2 % Total 100 % 100 % (1) % of Net sales by operating segment excludes sales held in Corporate. The following is a summary of reportable segment results: Three Months Ended September 30 Net Sales Earnings/(Loss) Before Income Taxes Net Earnings Beauty 2021 $ 3,964 $ 1,242 $ 991 2020 3,786 1,228 976 Grooming 2021 1,687 518 417 2020 1,601 426 355 Health Care 2021 2,676 695 529 2020 2,471 679 525 Fabric & Home Care 2021 7,009 1,546 1,191 2020 6,644 1,743 1,349 Baby, Feminine & Family Care 2021 4,864 1,075 826 2020 4,723 1,318 1,010 Corporate 2021 138 ( 41 ) 172 2020 93 ( 97 ) 93 Total Company 2021 $ 20,338 $ 5,035 $ 4,126 2020 19,318 5,297 4,308 Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. 4. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill is allocated by reportable segment as follows: Beauty Grooming Health Care Fabric & Home Care Baby, Feminine & Family Care Total Company Goodwill at June 30, 2021 $ 13,257 $ 13,095 $ 8,046 $ 1,873 $ 4,653 $ 40,924 Translation and other ( 152 ) ( 111 ) ( 109 ) ( 14 ) ( 45 ) ( 431 ) Goodwill at September 30, 2021 $ 13,105 $ 12,984 $ 7,937 $ 1,859 $ 4,608 $ 40,493 Goodwill decreased from June 30, 2021 due to currency translation, partially offset by a minor acquisition within Health Care. Identifiable intangible assets at September 30, 2021 were comprised of: Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Intangible assets with determinable lives $ 8,570 $ ( 6,149 ) Intangible assets with indefinite lives 21,083 — Total identifiable intangible assets $ 29,653 $ ( 6,149 ) Intangible assets with determinable lives consist of brands, patents, technology and customer relationships. The intangible assets with indefinite lives primarily consist of brands. The amortization expense of determinable-lived intangible assets for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020 was $ 77 million and $ 84 million, respectively. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment by comparing the estimated fair values of our reporting units and underlying indefinite-lived intangible assets to their respective carrying values. We typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of these assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. If the resulting fair value is less than the asset's carrying value, that difference represents an impairment. Our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets occurs during the three months ended December 31. The business unit valuations used to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment depend on a number of significant estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment, margin expansion and Company business plans. We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable. However, future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount rates, tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. To the extent changes in such factors result in a failure to achieve the level of projected cash flows initially used to estimate fair value for purposes of establishing or subsequently impairing the carrying amount of goodwill and related intangible assets, we may need to record non-cash impairment charges in the future. Most of our goodwill reporting units are comprised of a combination of legacy and acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that, at a minimum, exceed two times their underlying carrying values. Certain of our goodwill reporting units, in particular Shave Care and Appliances, are comprised entirely of acquired businesses and as a result, have fair value cushions that are not as high. The Appliances reporting unit has a fair value that significantly exceeds the underlying carrying value. As previously disclosed, the carrying value of the Shave Care reporting unit and the related Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset were impaired during the quarter ended June 30, 2019. Also, as previously disclosed, the Shave Care reporting unit fair value exceeded its carrying value by more than 20 % and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset fair value approximated its carrying value as of our fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 impairment testing dates. Accordingly, no impairment charge was recorded during the years ended June 30, 2021 or June 30, 2020. The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the net sales and earnings growth rates (including residual growth rates) and the discount rate. The residual growth rate represents the expected rate at which the Shave Care reporting unit and Gillette brand are expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period. The residual growth rate utilized in our fair value estimates is consistent with the reporting unit and brand operating plans and approximates expected long-term category market growth rates. The residual growth rate depends on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, relative currency exchange rates and business activities that impact market share. As a result, the residual growth rate could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes, devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or an increased competitive environment. The discount rate, which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, such as Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar. Spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the U.S. Another key assumption in our fair value determination of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is the royalty rate, which is driven by historical and estimated future profitability of the underlying Gillette business. The royalty rate may be impacted by significant adverse changes in long-term operating margins. While management can and has implemented strategies to address these events, changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that would trigger future impairment charges of the Shave Care reporting unit's goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. The duration and severity of the pandemic could also result in future impairment charges for the Shave Care reporting unit goodwill and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset. While we have concluded that a triggering event did not occur during the quarter ended September 30, 2021, the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is most susceptible to future impairment risk. Our assessment of the Gillette intangible asset assumes the net sales growth rates will begin to recover from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic during the current fiscal year. There continues to be a high level of uncertainty relating to how the pandemic will evolve, how governments and consumers will react, progress on the distribution of vaccines and whether the pandemic will have a longer-term effect on consumer habits. Accordingly, there continues to be risk related to this key assumption. A more prolonged pandemic recovery period could impact the assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset that are significant enough to trigger an impairment. Net sales and earnings growth rates could be negatively impacted by reductions or changes in demand for our shave care products, which may be caused by, among other things: the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine or other travel restrictions, or financial hardship, changes in the use and frequency of grooming products or by shifts in demand away from one or more of our higher priced products to lower priced products. In addition, relative global and country/regional macroeconomic factors could result in additional and prolonged devaluation of other countries’ currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Finally, the discount rate utilized in our valuation model could be impacted by changes in the underlying interest rates and risk premiums included in the determination of the cost of capital. As of September 30, 2021, the carrying values of the Shave Care goodwill and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset were $ 12.7 billion and $ 14.1 billion, respectively. We performed a sensitivity analysis for the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset during our most recently completed annual impairment testing, utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the shorter-term and residual growth rates, discount rate, and royalty rate to demonstrate the potential impacts to the estimated fair values. The table below provides, in isolation, the estimated fair value impacts related to a 25 basis-point increase in the discount rate, a 25 basis-point decrease in our shorter-term and residual growth rates, or a 50 basis point decrease in our royalty rate, any of which, in isolation, would result in an impairment of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset.

Earnings Per Share Basic net earnings per common share are calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble less preferred dividends by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net earnings per common share are calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble by the diluted weighted average number of common shares during the period. The diluted shares include the dilutive effect of stock options and other stock-based awards based on the treasury stock method and the assumed conversion of preferred stock. Net earnings per share were calculated as follows: CONSOLIDATED AMOUNTS Three Months Ended September 30 2021 2020 Net earnings $ 4,126 $ 4,308 Less: Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 14 31 Net earnings attributable to P&G (Diluted) 4,112 4,277 Less: Preferred dividends 70 66 Net earnings attributable to P&G available to common shareholders (Basic) $ 4,042 $ 4,211 SHARES IN MILLIONS Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 2,428.1 2,486.1 Add: Effect of dilutive securities Convertible preferred shares (1) 80.5 83.9 Stock options and other unvested equity awards (2) 50.3 55.3 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 2,558.9 2,625.3 NET EARNINGS PER SHARE (3) Basic $ 1.66 $ 1.69 Diluted $ 1.61 $ 1.63 (1) An overview of preferred shares can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2021. (2) Excludes 9 million and 1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, of weighted average stock options outstanding because the exercise price of these options was greater than their average market value or their effect was antidilutive. (3) Net earnings per share are calculated on Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble. 6. Share-Based Compensation and Postretirement Benefits The following table provides a summary of our share-based compensation expense and postretirement benefit costs: Three Months Ended September 30 2021 2020 Share-based compensation expense $ 116 $ 89 Net periodic benefit cost for pension benefits (1) 48 47 Net periodic benefit credit for other retiree benefits (1) ( 103 ) ( 80 ) (1) The components of the total net periodic benefit cost/(credit) for both pension benefits and other retiree benefits for these interim periods, on an annualized basis, do not differ materially from the amounts disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. 7. Risk Management Activities and Fair Value Measurements As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. There have been no significant changes in our risk management policies or activities during the three months ended September 30, 2021. The Company has not changed its valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period. The Company recognizes transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of each quarter. There were no transfers between levels during the periods presented. Also, there was no significant activity within the Level 3 assets and liabilities during the periods presented. There were no significant assets or liabilities that were remeasured at fair value on a non-recurring basis for the three months ended September 30, 2021. Cash equivalents were $ 9.0 billion and $ 9.1 billion as of September 30, 2021 and June 30, 2021, respectively, and are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. Other investments had a fair value of $ 160 and $ 192 as of September 30, 2021 and June 30, 2021, respectively, including equity securities of $ 131 and $ 163 as of September 30, 2021 and June 30, 2021, respectively, and are presented in Other noncurrent assets. Investments are measured at fair value and primarily classified as Level 1 and Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Level 1 are based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets, and Level 2 are based on quoted market prices for similar instruments. There are no material investment balances classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy or using net asset value as a practical expedient. Unrealized losses on equity securities were $( 29 ) during the three months ended September 30, 2021. Unrealized losses on equity securities were not significant for the three months ended September 30, 2020. These unrealized losses are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in Other non-operating income/(expense), net. The fair value of long-term debt was $ 28.4 billion and $ 28.8 billion as of September 30, 2021 and June 30, 2021, respectively. This includes the current portion of long-term debt instruments ($ 5.9 billion and $ 3.6 billion as of September 30, 2021 and June 30, 2021, respectively). Certain long-term debt (debt designated as a fair value hedge) is recorded at fair value. All other long-term debt is recorded at amortized cost but is measured at fair value for disclosure purposes. We consider our debt to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Fair values are generally estimated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments. Disclosures about Financial Instruments The notional amounts and fair values of financial instruments used in hedging transactions as of September 30, 2021 and June 30, 2021 are as follows: Notional Amount Fair Value Asset Fair Value (Liability) September 30, 2021 June 30, 2021 September 30, 2021 June 30, 2021 September 30, 2021 June 30, 2021 DERIVATIVES IN FAIR VALUE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Interest rate contracts $ 7,280 $ 7,415 $ 110 $ 146 $ — $ — DERIVATIVES IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Foreign currency interest rate contracts $ 9,506 $ 8,484 $ 248 $ 89 $ ( 19 ) $ ( 94 ) TOTAL DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS $ 16,786 $ 15,899 $ 358 $ 235 $ ( 19 ) $ ( 94 ) DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS Foreign currency contracts $ 7,058 $ 5,060 $ 16 $ 20 $ ( 36 ) $ ( 22 ) TOTAL DERIVATIVES AT FAIR VALUE $ 23,844 $ 20,959 $ 374 $ 255 $ ( 55 ) $ ( 116 ) The fair value of the interest rate derivative asset/(liability) directly offsets the cumulative amount of the fair value hedging adjustment included in the carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation. The carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation, which includes the unamortized discount or premium and the fair value adjustment, was $ 7.4 billion and $ 7.5 billion as of September 30, 2021 and June 30, 2021, respectively. In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges. The carrying value of those debt instruments designated as net investment hedges, which includes the adjustment for the foreign currency transaction gain or loss on those instruments, was $ 11.7 billion and $ 12.0 billion as of September 30, 2021 and June 30, 2021, respectively. The increase in the notional balance of foreign currency contracts not designated as hedging instruments primarily reflects changes in the level of intercompany financing activity during the period. All derivative assets are presented in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Other noncurrent assets. All derivative liabilities are presented in Accrued and other liabilities or Other noncurrent liabilities. Changes in the fair value of net investment hedges are recognized in the Foreign currency translation component of Other comprehensive income (OCI). All of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. Before tax gains/(losses) on our financial instruments in hedging relationships are categorized as follows: Amount of Gain/(Loss) Recognized in OCI on Derivatives Three Months Ended September 30 2021 2020 DERIVATIVES IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS (1) (2) Foreign exchange contracts $ 208 $ (186) (1) For the derivatives in net investment hedging relationships, the amount of gain excluded from effectiveness testing, which was recognized in earnings, was $ 15 and $ 14 for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. (2) In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges. The amount of gain recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) for such instruments was $ 303 and $( 646 ) for the three months ended September 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Amount of Gain/(Loss) Recognized in Earnings Three Months Ended September 30 2021 2020 DERIVATIVES IN FAIR VALUE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Interest rate contracts $ ( 36 ) $ 7 DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS Foreign currency contracts $ ( 24 ) $ 106 The gain/(loss) on the derivatives in fair value hedging relationships is fully offset by the mark-to-market impact of the related exposure. These are both recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in Interest expense. The gain/(loss) on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is substantially offset by the currency mark-to-market of the related exposure. These are both recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A). 8. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss) The table below presents the changes in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) attributable to Procter & Gamble (AOCI), including the reclassifications out of AOCI by component: Investment Securities Post-retirement Benefits Foreign Currency Translation Total AOCI Balance at June 30, 2021 $ 15 $ ( 2,963 ) $ ( 10,796 ) $ ( 13,744 ) OCI before reclassifications (1) 5 80 ( 465 ) ( 380 ) Amounts reclassified from AOCI into the Consolidated Statements of Earnings (2) 62 62 Net current period OCI 5 142 ( 465 ) ( 318 ) Less: Other comprehensive income/(loss) attributable to non-controlling interests — — — — Balance at September 30, 2021 $ 20 $ ( 2,821 ) $ ( 11,261 ) $ ( 14,062 ) (1) Net of tax expense/(benefit) of $ 1 , $ 29 and $ 120 for gains/losses on investment securities, postretirement benefit items and foreign currency translation, respectively. Income tax effects within cumulative translation include impacts from items such as net investment hedge transactions. Foreign cumulative translation is not adjusted for income taxes related to permanent investments in international subsidiaries. (2) Net of tax expense/(benefit) of $ 0 , $ 20 and $ 0 for gains/losses on investment securities, postretirement benefit items and foreign currency translation, respectively. The below provides additional details on amounts reclassified from AOCI into the Consolidated Statements of Earnings: • Investment securities: amounts reclassified from AOCI into Other non-operating income, net. • Postretirement benefits: amounts reclassified from AOCI into Other non-operating income, net and included in the computation of net periodic postretirement costs. 9. Commitments and Contingencies Litigation We are subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental, patent and trademark matters, labor and employment matters and tax. While considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management and our counsel, the ultimate resolution of the various lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior manufacturing and waste disposal practices. Based on currently available information, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of environmental remediation will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Income Tax Uncertainties The Company is present in approximately 70 countries and over 150 taxable jurisdictions and, at any point in time, has 40 – 50 jurisdictional audits underway at various stages of completion. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite our belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitations. Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate. We have tax years open ranging from 2008 and forward. We are generally not able to reliably estimate the ultimate settlement amounts until the close of the audit. While we do not expect material changes, it is possible that the amount of unrecognized benefit with respect to our uncertain tax positions could increase or decrease within the next 12 months. At this time we are not able to make a reasonable estimate of the range of impact on the balance of uncertain tax positions or the impact on the effective tax rate related to these items. Additional information on the Commitments and Contingencies of the Company can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2021. Item 2.

A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected herein, is included in the section titled ""Economic Conditions and Uncertainties"" and the section titled ""Risk Factors"" (Part I, Item 1A) of this Form 10-Q. The purpose of Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is to provide an understanding of Procter & Gamble's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. The MD&A is organized into the following sections: • Overview • Summary of Results – Three months ended September 30, 2021 • Economic Conditions and Uncertainties • Results of Operations – Three months ended September 30, 2021 • Business Segment Discussion – Three months ended September 30, 2021 • Liquidity and Capital Resources • Reconciliation of Measures Not Defined by U.S. GAAP Throughout the MD&A, we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales and net earnings. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), that include organic sales gr owth, core net earnings per share (Core EPS), adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity. The explanation at the end of the MD&A provides the definition of these non-GAAP measures, details on the use and the derivation of these measures, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition, despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and market consumption in the MD&A are based on a combination of vendor purchased traditional brick-and-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales of our products in dollar terms on a constant currency basis relative to all product sales in the category. The Company measures fiscal year to date market shares through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months as compared to the end of the reporting period. Management also uses unit volume growth to evaluate and explain drivers of changes in net sales. Organic volume growth reflects year-over-year changes in unit volume excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and certain one-time items, if applicable, and is used to explain changes in organic sales. OVERVIEW P&G is a global leader in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories, primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, baby stores, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores and professional channels. We also sell direct to consumers. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries. Our market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We believe we are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position. The table below lists our reportable segments, including the product categories and brand composition within each segment. Reportable Segments Product Categories (Sub-Categories) Major Brands Beauty Hair Care ( Conditioners, Shampoos, Styling Aids, Treatments ) Head & Shoulders, Herbal Essences, Pantene, Rejoice Skin and Personal Care ( Antiperspirants and Deodorants, Personal Cleansing, Skin Care ) Olay, Old Spice, Safeguard, Secret, SK-II Grooming Grooming (1) (Shave Care - Female Blades & Razors, Male Blades & Razors, Pre- and Post-Shave Products, Other Shave Care; Appliances) Braun, Gillette, Venus Health Care Oral Care ( Toothbrushes, Toothpastes, Other Oral Care ) Crest, Oral-B Personal Health Care ( Gastrointestinal, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements, Pain Relief, Other Personal Health Care ) Metamucil, Neurobion, Pepto-Bismol, Vicks Fabric & Home Care Fabric Care ( Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Additives, Laundry Detergents ) Ariel, Downy, Gain, Tide Home Care ( Air Care, Dish Care, P&G Professional, Surface Care ) Cascade, Dawn, Fairy, Febreze, Mr. Clean, Swiffer Baby, Feminine & Family Care Baby Care ( Baby Wipes, Taped Diapers and Pants ) Luvs, Pampers Feminine Care ( Adult Incontinence, Feminine Care ) Always, Always Discreet, Tampax Family Care ( Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper ) Bounty, Charmin, Puffs (1) The Grooming product category is comprised of the Shave Care and Appliances operating segments. The following table provides the percentage of net sales and net earnings by reportable business segment for the three months ended September 30, 2021 (excluding net sales and net earnings in Corporate): Three Months Ended September 30, 2021 Net Sales Net Earnings Beauty 20% 25% Grooming 8% 11% Health Care 13% 13% Fabric & Home Care 35% 30% Baby, Feminine & Family Care 24% 21% Total Company 100% 100% SUMMARY OF RESULTS The following are highlights of results for the three months ended September 30, 2021 versus the three months ended September 30, 2020: • Net sales increased 5% to $20.3 billion, due to a high single digit increase in Health Care, mid-single digit increases in Beauty, Grooming and Fabric & Home Care and a low single digit increase in Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, increased 4%. Organic sales increased high single digits in Health Care, increased mid-single digits in Grooming and in Fabric & Home Care and increased low single digits in Beauty and in Baby, Feminine & Family Care. • Net earnings were $4.1 billion, a decrease of $0.2 billion or 4% versus the prior year period as the increase in net sales was more than offset by a decrease in operating margin. • Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble decreased $0.2 billion or 4% versus the prior year period to $4.1 billion. • Diluted net earnings per share (EPS) decreased 1% to $1.61 due primarily to the decrease in net earnings, partially offset by a reduction in the weighted average shares outstanding. Core net earnings per share also decreased 1% to $1.61 due to the absence of any non-core adjustments in either period. • Operating cash flow was $4.6 billion. Adjusted free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less capital expenditures and certain other impacts, was $3.8 billion. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 92%. ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES Global Economic Conditions. Our products are sold in numerous countries across North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa, with more than half our sales generated outside the United States. As such, we are exposed to and impacted by global macroeconomic factors, U.S. and foreign government policies and foreign exchange fluctuations. Global economic conditions continue to be highly volatile due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in market size contractions in certain countries due to economic slowdowns and government restrictions on movement. Other macroeconomic factors also remain dynamic, and any causes of market size contraction, such as greater political unrest or instability in the Middle East, Central & Eastern Europe, certain Latin American markets, the Hong Kong market in Greater China and the Korean peninsula could reduce our sales or erode our operating margin, and consequently reduce our net earnings and cash flows. Changes in Costs. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, transportation costs and our own productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp, and volatility in the market price of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs. Disruptions in our manufacturing, supply and distribution operations, including energy shortages, port congestions, labor constraints, freight container and truck shortages have impacted our costs and could do so in the future. If we are unable to manage these impacts through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions, as well as through consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. Net sales could also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on the consumption of our products. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including outsourcing projects, supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. If we are not successful in executing and sustaining these changes, there could be a negative impact on our gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. Foreign Exchange. We have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates. Translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation of transaction-related working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. In three out of the past four years a number of foreign currencies have weakened versus the U.S. dollar, leading to lower sales and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts. Certain countries that recently had and are currently experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations include Argentina, Turkey, Brazil and Russia. These fluctuations have significantly impacted our historical net sales, costs and net earnings and could do so in the future. Increased pricing in response to certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could also have a negative impact on the consumption of our products, which would negatively affect our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. Government Policies. Our net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government legislative, regulatory or enforcement policies. For example, our net earnings and cash flows could be affected by any future legislative or regulatory changes in U.S. or non-U.S. tax policy, or any significant change in global tax policy adopted under the current work being led by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (""OECD"") for the G20 focused on ""Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy."" The breadth of the OECD project extends beyond pure digital businesses and if agreed and enacted by most countries is likely to impact most large multinational businesses by both redefining jurisdictional taxation rights and broadly establishing a 15% minimum tax on their foreign operations. Our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows may also be impacted by changes in U.S. and foreign government policies related to environmental and climate change matters. Additionally, we attempt to carefully manage our debt, currency and other exposures in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and pricing controls, such as Nigeria, Algeria, Egypt, Argentina and Turkey. Further, our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes to international trade agreements in North America and elsewhere, including any impacts from post-Brexit (United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union) trade agreements. Changes in government policies in these areas might cause an increase or decrease in our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. COVID-19 Disclosures. Our priorities during the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be in protecting the health and safety of our employees; maximizing the availability of products that help consumers with their health, hygiene and cleaning needs; and using our employees’ talents and our resources to help society meet and overcome the current challenges. Because we sell products that are essential to the daily lives of consumers, the pandemic has not had a materially negative impact to our consolidated net sales, as positive and negative impacts continue to largely offset each other. We further describe these impacts for the period covered by this report in the Business Segment Discussion of the MD&A. In the future, the pandemic may reduce demand for our products if it results in a recessionary global economic environment. Demand in certain countries in Latin America, Asia Pacific and IMEA may be particularly susceptible to recession. It could also lead to volatility in consumer access to our products (due to government actions or transportation and labor shortages impacting our ability to produce and ship products) or could impact consumers’ movements and access to our products. The resumption towards normalcy in economic activity as governmental restrictions are relaxed and economies gradually, partially, or fully reopen in certain regions and markets, could also result in reduced demand due to consumption decreases and consumer pantry destocking (particularly, in home cleaning and hygiene products). Our retail customers are also impacted by the pandemic and their success in addressing issues and maintaining their operations could impact consumer access to and, as a result, sales of our products. We believe that in the long term, there will continue to be strong demand for categories in which we operate, particularly our products that deliver essential health, hygiene and cleaning benefits. However, the uncertainty in the timing and extent of demand volatility, the relaxation and reimplementation of movement restrictions, the timing and impact of potential consumer pantry destocking, and future economic trends due to a resurgence of positive cases, the emergence of new variants of the virus, the speed at which treatments and vaccines are administered and governmental actions in response to the pandemic may result in heightened volatility of net sales, net earnings and cash flows during and subsequent to the pandemic. Business Continuity . Our ability to continue to operate without any significant negative impacts will in part depend on our ability to protect our employees and our supply chain. The Company has endeavored to follow the recommendations from governments and health authorities, including on vaccine administration, with specific measures in place for those working in our plants and distribution facilities. We have also worked closely with local and national officials to keep our manufacturing facilities open due to the essential nature of the majority of our products. While we have been able to broadly maintain our operations, we experienced some disruption in our supply chain in certain markets in Asia Pacific due primarily to the restriction of employee movements and in North America due to labor shortages and transportation constraints. We intend to continue to work with government authorities and implement employee safety measures to minimize disruption to the manufacturing and distribution of our products. However, uncertainty in the duration and scope of the pandemic, the emergence of new variants of the virus, the likelihood of a resurgence of positive cases, the speed at which treatments and vaccines are administered and governmental actions in response to the pandemic could result in an unforeseen disruption to our supply chain and impact our operations. For example, a closure of a key manufacturing or distribution facility or the inability of a key material or transportation supplier to source and transport materials. Liquidity . Because the pandemic, thus far, has not had a material negative impact on our operations, on the demand for our products or the resulting net sales and net earnings, it has not negatively impacted the Company’s liquidity position. We continue to generate operating cash flows to meet our short-term liquidity needs and continue to maintain access to capital markets enabled by our strong short- and long-term credit ratings. Impairments . We have not observed any material impairments or other significant reductions in the fair value of our recorded assets due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Three Months Ended September 30, 2021 The following discussion provides a review of results for the three months ended September 30, 2021 versus the three months ended September 30, 2020. Three Months Ended September 30 Amounts in millions, except per share amounts 2021 2020 % Chg Net sales $20,338 $19,318 5% Operating income 5,023 5,281 (5)% Net earnings 4,126 4,308 (4)% Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 4,112 4,277 (4)% Diluted net earnings per common share 1.61 1.63 (1)% Core net earnings per common share 1.61 1.63 (1)% Three Months Ended September 30 COMPARISONS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES 2021 2020 Basis Pt Chg Gross margin 49.0% 52.7% (370) Selling, general & administrative expense 24.3% 25.3% (100) Operating income 24.7% 27.3% (260) Earnings before income taxes 24.8% 27.4% (260) Net earnings 20.3% 22.3% (200) Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 20.2% 22.1% (190) Net Sales Net sales for the quarter increased 5% to $20.3 billion on a 2% increase in unit volume. Higher pricing increased net sales by 1%. Positive mix increased net sales by 1%, driven by the disproportionate growth of the North America region, the Health Care business and premium products in Shave Care, Baby Care and Feminine Care, all of which have higher than Company-average selling prices. Favorable foreign exchange had a 1% positive impact on net sales. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, organic sales increased 4% on a 2% increase in organic volume. Net sales increased high single digits in Health Care, increased mid-single digits in Beauty, Grooming and Fabric & Home Care, and increased low single digits in Baby, Feminine & Family Care. On a regional basis, volume increased mid-single digits in Latin America and low single digits in North America and Europe, partially offset by low single digit decreases in Greater China, Asia Pacific and IMEA.

(2) Other includes the sales mix impact from acquisitions and divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile volume to net sales. Operating Costs Gross margin decreased 370 basis points to 49% of net sales for the quarter. The decrease in gross margin was due to: • 350 basis points of increased commodity costs, • an 80 basis point decline from unfavorable mix, primarily due to negative product mix due to the disproportionate growth of large pack sizes, launch and growth of premium-priced products that are profit-accretive but have lower than Company-average gross margin and higher volumes of lower-margin display packs in certain regions and businesses, and • a 40 basis point decline from higher restructuring charges versus the base period. These impacts were offset by: • a 50 basis point increase due to higher pricing, • 30 basis points of net manufacturing productivity savings (100 basis points of gross savings, partially offset by 50 basis points of increased transportation impacts and 20 basis points of product and packaging investments and other impacts), and • 20 basis points of benefit from favorable foreign exchange impacts. Total SG&A spending increased 1% to $5.0 billion due to increased marketing spending, partially offset by a decrease in other operating costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 100 basis points to 24.3% due to a decrease in overhead costs as a percentage of net sales and a decrease in other operating expenses as a percentage of sales. Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales decreased 50 basis points primarily due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and productivity savings, partially offset by inflation and other cost increases. Other operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased 60 basis points due to a gain on the sale of operating real estate. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales remained flat due to increased media spending, offset by the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and savings in agency compensation, production costs and advertising spending. Productivity-driven cost savings delivered 80 basis points of benefit to SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Non-Operating Expenses and Income Interest expense was $109 million for the quarter, a $27 million decrease versus the prior year period driven by lower average interest rates. Interest income was $11 million for the quarter, a $1 million increase versus the prior year period. Other non-operating income was $110 million, a decrease of $32 million due to current period unrealized losses on equity investments. Income Taxes For the three months ended September 30, 2021, the effective tax rate decreased 60 basis points versus the prior year period to 18.1% due to: • a 60 basis point decrease from discrete impacts related to uncertain tax positions (55 basis point favorable impact in the current year versus a 5 basis point unfavorable impact in the prior year period), and • a 60 basis point decrease from favorable impacts from the geographic mix of current year earnings. These decreases are partially offset by a 60 basis point increase from lower excess tax benefits of share-based compensation (190 basis point reduction in the current period versus a 250 basis point reduction in the prior year period). Net Earnings Operating income decreased $258 million, or 5%, to $5.0 billion for the quarter, as the increase in net sales was more than offset by the decrease in operating margin, the components of which are described above. Net earnings decreased $182 million, or 4%, to $4.1 billion as the decreases in operating income and other non-operating income discussed above were partially offset by the decrease in the effective income tax rate. Foreign exchange had a positive impact of approximately $61 million on net earnings for the quarter, including both transactional and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars. Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble decreased $165 million or, 4%, to $4.1 billion for the quarter. Diluted net earnings per share decreased 1% to $1.61 versus the base period due to the decrease in net earnings partially offset by a reduction in the weighted average number of shares outstanding. BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSION – Three Months Ended September 30, 2021 The following discussion provides a review of results by reportable business segment. Analysis of the results for the three month period ended September 30, 2021 is provided based on a comparison to the three month period ended September 30, 2020. The primary financial measures used to evaluate segment performance are net sales and net earnings. The table below provides supplemental information on net sales, earnings before income taxes and net earnings by reportable business segment for the three months ended September 30, 2021 versus the comparable prior year period (dollar amounts in millions): Three Months Ended September 30, 2021 Net Sales % Change Versus Year Ago Earnings/(Loss) Before Income Taxes % Change Versus Year Ago Net Earnings % Change Versus Year Ago Beauty $ 3,964 5 % $ 1,242 1 % $ 991 2 % Grooming 1,687 5 % 518 22 % 417 17 % Health Care 2,676 8 % 695 2 % 529 1 % Fabric & Home Care 7,009 5 % 1,546 (11) % 1,191 (12) % Baby, Feminine & Family Care 4,864 3 % 1,075 (18) % 826 (18) % Corporate 138 N/A (41) N/A 172 N/A Total Company $ 20,338 5 % $ 5,035 (5) % $ 4,126 (4) % Beauty Three months ended September 30, 2021 compared with three months ended September 30, 2020 Beauty net sales increased 5% to $4.0 billion on unit volume that was unchanged. Higher pricing increased net sales by 2%. Foreign exchange impacts increased net sales by 3%. Organic sales increased 2%. Global market share of the Beauty segment increased 0.1 points. • Hair Care net sales increased mid-single digits on flat volume due to inflation-related price increases, favorable foreign exchange impacts and favorable mix driven by the higher proportion of sales of premium tier products including treatments and conditioners, all of which have higher than category-average selling prices. Organic sales increased low single digits. Volume increased mid-single digits in IMEA (due to increased demand following pandemic-related shutdowns) and low single digits in Europe (due to innovation and market recovery, partially offset by declines following increased pricing in certain markets). This volume increase was partially offset by a mid-single digit decline in Greater China (due to trade inventory reductions and to a lesser extent, a slowdown in e-commerce consumption) and a low single digit decline in Latin America (due to increased pricing). Global market share of the Hair Care category decreased more than half a point. • Skin and Personal Care net sales increased mid-single digits due to a low single digit increase in volume, increased pricing and favorable foreign exchange impacts, partially offset by negative geographic mix caused by pandemic-related shutdowns. Organic sales increased low single digits. Volume increased high teens in Latin America (due to pandemic-related consumption declines in the base period) and increased double digits in Greater China (due to new innovation, e-commerce growth and customer inventory build-up). This volume increase was partially offset by a high single digit decrease in Asia Pacific (due to pandemic-related consumption increases in the base period and inventory destocking) and mid-single digit decreases in Europe and in North America (due to pandemic-related consumption increases in the base period and to a lesser extent, current period port congestion related supply constraints). Global market share of the Skin and Personal Care category increased less than half a point. Net earnings increased 2% to $991 million due to the increase in net sales partially offset by an 80 basis point decrease in net earnings margin. The net earnings margin decreased primarily due to a reduction in gross margin driven by increased commodity costs and negative geographic mix due to pandemic-related shutdowns, partially offset by the positive impacts of increased pricing, favorable foreign exchange and manufacturing cost savings. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased marginally due to an increase in media spending. Grooming Three months ended September 30, 2021 compared with three months ended September 30, 2020 Grooming net sales increased 5% to $1.7 billion on a 1% increase in unit volume. Increased pricing had a positive 2% impact on net sales. Favorable mix had a positive 2% impact on net sales due to growth in North America and premium shave care products, both of which have higher than segment-average selling prices. Foreign exchange increased net sales by 1%. Organic sales increased 4%. Global market share of the Grooming segment increased 1.1 points. • Shave Care net sales increased high single digits due to a low single digit volume increase, increased pricing, favorable mix (due to growth in North America and the disproportionate growth of premium female shave systems products, both of which have higher than category-average selling prices) and favorable foreign exchange impacts. Organic sales increased mid-single digits. Volume increased double digits in North America, mid-single digits in Latin America and low single digits in Europe due to innovation and market size increases versus a base period that was negatively impacted by the pandemic. This was partially offset by a high single digit decrease in Asia Pacific and mid-single digit declines in Greater China and in IMEA due to trade destocking in certain markets and lower consumer promotions. Global market share of the Shave Care category increased more than half a point. • Appliances net sales decreased low single digits primarily due to a double digit volume decrease, partially offset by favorable mix (due to the disproportionate growth of premium female epilators and shavers) and favorable foreign exchange impacts. Organic sales decreased mid-single digits. Volume declined about 20% in North America and decreased double digits in Europe due to a pandemic-related consumption increase of at-home grooming and styling products in the base period. Global market share of the Appliances category increased more than half a point. Net earnings increased 17% to $417 million due to the increase in net sales and a 250 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. The net earnings margin increased due to an increase in gross margin and a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. The gross margin increase was driven by manufacturing cost savings and increased selling prices, partially offset by negative mix driven by the launch of premium-priced, profit-accretive products that have lower than segment-average gross margins. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase. The higher effective tax rate was driven by disproportionate growth in North America. Health Care Three months ended September 30, 2021 compared with three months ended September 30, 2020 Health Care net sales increased 8% to $2.7 billion on a 3% increase in unit volume. Favorable mix increased net sales by 3% due to the disproportionate growth of the North America region and the Personal Health Care category, both of which have higher than segment average selling prices. Increased pricing had a 1% positive impact on net sales. Foreign exchange had a 1% positive impact on net sales. Organic sales increased 7%. Global market share of the Health Care segment increased 0.2 points. • Oral Care net sales increased mid-single digits as a low single digit decrease in volume was more than offset by positive mix impacts from the growth of premium power brush, toothpaste and manual brush products, and favorable foreign exchange impacts. Organic sales increased low single digits. The volume decrease was driven by a mid-teens decline in Greater China and a mid-single digit decline in Latin America, both due to increased competitive activity, and a low single digit decline in Europe due to lower shipments. These volume decreases were partially offset by a double digit increase in IMEA and a low single digit increase in North America both due to innovation. Global market share of the Oral Care category increased nearly a point. • Personal Health Care net sales increased mid-teens due to a double digit increase in volume, inflation-related price increases and favorable foreign exchange. Organic sales increased double digits. Volume increased more than 40% in APAC, increased mid-teens in North America and increased mid-single digits in Europe, Latin America and IMEA due to market recovery of respiratory products and innovation across segments. Global market share of the Personal Health Care category was unchanged. Net earnings increased 1% to $529 million due to the increase in net sales partially offset by a 140 basis-point decrease in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin decreased due to a decrease in gross margin, an increase in SG&A as a per centage of net sales and a decrease in other non-operating income. The decrease in gross margin was driven by increased commodity and transportation costs, and unfavorable mix caused by the growth of premium-priced, profit-accretive products that have lower than segment-average gross margins. These decreases are partially offset by manufacturing cost savings, increased pricing and favorable foreign exchange. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to an increase in media spending behind innovation support, partially offset by the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase. Non-operating income as a percentage of net sales decreased due to a minor brand divestiture gain in the base period. Fabric & Home Care Three months ended September 30, 2021 compared with three months ended September 30, 2020 Fabric & Home Care net sales increased 5% to $7.0 billion on a 2% increase in unit volume. Higher pricing increased net sales by 2%. Favorable mix increased net sales by 1% due to the disproportionate growth of the North America region and premium forms in Fabric Care, all of which have higher than segment-average selling prices. Foreign exchange had a 1% positive impact to net sales. Organic sales increased 5%. Global market share of the Fabric & Home Care segment increased 1.3 points. • Fabric Care net sales increased high single digits due to a low single digit increase in volume, increased pricing, favorable foreign exchange and positive mix impacts due to the growth of the North America region and premium forms like fabric enhancer beads and laundry unit dose, all of which have higher than category-average selling prices. Organic sales increased high single digits. Increased volume was driven by high single digit increases in North America and Latin America (due to innovation, including fabric enhancers and unit dose, and increased distribution) and a low single digit increase in Europe (due to innovation), partially offset by a low single digit decline in Asia Pacific (due to pandemic-related lockdowns in certain markets). Global market share of the Fabric Care category increased more than a point. • Home Care net sales increased low single digits due primarily to increased pricing, partially offset by a low single digit decrease in volume and unfavorable mix due to a volume decrease in the North America region which has a higher than category-average selling price. Organic sales also increased low single digits. The volume decrease was driven by a low single digit decline in North America (due to pandemic-related consumption increases in the base period), partially offset by a low single digit increase in Europe (due to innovation). Global market share of the Home Care category increased more than a point. Net earnings decreased 12% to $1.2 billion as the increase in net sales was more than offset by a 330 basis point reduction in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin decreased due primarily to a reduction in gross margin. The gross margin decrease was driven by an increase in commodity and transportation costs, and unfavorable mix caused by the growth of premium-priced, profit-accretive products that have lower than segment-average gross margins, partially offset by increased selling prices. SG&A as a percentage of net sales declined marginally due to the positive scale benefits of the net sales increase. Baby, Feminine & Family Care Three months ended September 30, 2021 compared with three months ended September 30, 2020 Baby, Feminine & Family Care net sales increased 3% to $4.9 billion on a 1% increase in unit volume. Favorable mix had a 2% positive impact to net sales due to the disproportionate growth of North America and growth of premium diaper pants and adult incontinence products, all of which have higher than segment-average selling prices. Foreign exchange had a positive 1% impact to net sales. Lower pricing reduced net sales by 1% due to increased promotional spending related to Family Care products. Organic sales increased 2%. Global market share of the Baby, Feminine & Family Care segment increased 0.7 points. • Baby Care net sales increased high single digits due to a low single digit increase in volume, inflation-driven price increases, positive mix (due to the growth of premium pants and taped diaper products) and favorable foreign exchange impact. Organic sales increased mid-single digits. Volume increased mid-teens in Latin America (due to innovation) and increased mid-single digits in Europe (due to increased consumption following pandemic-related slowdowns), partially offset by a double digit decline in Greater China (due to increased competitive activity and trade inventory reductions) and a high single digit decline in Asia Pacific (due to market size declines). Global market share of the Baby Care category was unchanged. • Feminine Care net sales increased high single digits due to a low single digit increase in volume, favorable foreign exchange, increased pricing and positive mix driven by the growth of the North America region and the growth of premium adult incontinence and premium pads and tampons, all of which have higher than category-average selling prices. Organic sales increased mid-single digits. Volume increased double digits in North America (due to innovation and distribution gains) and low single digits in Europe (due to trade inventory build ahead of price increases) partially offset by mid-single digit volume decreases in IMEA (due to pandemic-related increased consumption in base period), in Greater China (due to lower consumption) and in Latin America (due to increased competitive activity). Global market share of the Feminine Care category increased nearly a point. • Family Care, which is predominantly a North American business, net sales decreased mid-single digits as a low single digit increase in volume (due to increased promotional events) was more than offset by lower pricing (in the form of increased promotional spending versus a low base period impacted by the pandemic) and unfavorable mix (due to disproportionate growth of large count packs). Organic sales also decreased mid-single digits. North America share of the Family Care category increased almost two points. Net earnings decreased 18% to $826 million as the increase in net sales was more than offset by a 440 basis-point decrease in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin decreased primarily due to a decrease in gross margin, partially offset by lower SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin decreased primarily due to an increase in commodity and transportation costs and lower selling prices, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased due to reductions in both marketing and overhead costs. Corporate Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business segments. These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level; financing and investing activities; certain employee benefit costs; other general corporate items; the gains and losses related to certain divested brands and categories; and certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the reportable segments to U.S. GAAP. The most significant reconciling item relates to income taxes, to adjust from blended statutory rates that are reflected in the reportable segments to the overall Company effective tax rate. Corporate net sales improved by $45 million to $138 million due to an increase in sales of the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level. Corporate net earnings improved by $79 million in the quarter primarily due to lower overhead costs and a gain on the sale of real estate. LIQUIDITY & CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating Activities We generated $4.6 billion of cash from operating activities fiscal year to date, a decrease of $96 million versus the prior year period. Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, deferred income taxes and gain on sale of assets), generated $4.9 billion of operating cash flow. Working capital and other impacts used $294 million of cash in the period. Accounts receivable increased, using $1.0 billion of cash, primarily due to sales growth. Days sales outstanding also increased about three days driven by a higher relative amount of sales towards the end of the quarter. Inventory increased, consuming $409 million of cash primarily due to input cost increases and inventory pre-builds for initiatives and seasonality in certain categories. Inventory days on hand decreased by three days. Accounts payable, accrued and other net operating assets and liabilities increased, generating $1.1 billion of cash. This was primarily driven by higher trade payables caused by an increase in supply chain costs (commodities, transportation, etc.) and, to a lesser extent, extended payment terms with our suppliers, partially offset by the payment of prior fiscal year-end incentive compensation and other salary-related accruals. The number of days payable outstanding stayed relatively flat at 86 days. Investing Activities Investing activities used $1.0 billion of cash fiscal year to date primarily due to capital expenditures. Financing Activities Financing activities used $3.4 billion of cash fiscal year to date. We used $2.8 billion for treasury stock purchases and $2.2 billion for dividends. The increase in net short-term debt, exercise of stock options and other financing activities generated $1.6 billion of cash. As of September 30, 2021, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $12.3 billion. We have short- and long-term debt to meet our financing needs. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements. RECONCILIATION OF MEASURES NOT DEFINED BY U.S. GAAP In accordance with the SEC's Regulation S-K Item 10(e), the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measure. Management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide useful perspective on underlying business trends and provide a supplemental measure of period-to-period financial results. Disclosing these non-GAAP financial measures allows investors and management to view our operating results excluding the impact of items that are not reflective of the underlying operating performance. Management uses these non-GAAP measures in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. Certain of these measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company’s reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP results. Our non-GAAP financial measures do not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. Therefore, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Organic sales growth: Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. This measure is used in assessing achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. Adjusted free cash flow: Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the U.S. Tax Act (the Company incurred a transitional tax liability of approximately $3.8 billion in fiscal 2018 from the U.S. Tax Act of 2017, which is payable over a period of 8 years). Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. Management views adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments. Adjusted free cash flow productivity: Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings. Management views adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G’s ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. This measure is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. The Company's long-term target is to generate annual adjusted free cash flow productivity at or above 90 percent. Core EPS: Core earnings per share, or Core EPS, is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share excluding items that are not judged to be part of the Company's sustainable results or trends. For the three months ended September 30, 2021 compared with the three months ended September 30, 2020, there are no adjustments to or reconciling items for diluted net earnings per share. Management views this non-GAAP measure as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time.

See accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Basis of Presentation These statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of The Procter & Gamble Company and subsidiaries (the ""Company,"" ""Procter & Gamble,"" ""P&G,"" ""we"" or ""our"") contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods reported. However, the results of operations included in such financial statements may not necessarily be indicative of annual results. 2. New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies On July 1, 2020, we adopted ASU 2017-04, ""Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment."" The standard simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by requiring a goodwill impairment to be measured using a single step impairment model, whereby the impairment equals the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the specified reporting units in their entirety. This eliminated the second step of the previous impairment model that required companies to first estimate the fair value of all assets in a reporting unit and measure impairments based on those estimated fair values and a residual measurement approach. It also specifies that any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The impact of the new standard will depend on the specific facts and circumstances of future individual impairments, if any. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, ""Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting."" The amendments provide optional guidance for a limited time to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform. The new guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met and to other derivative instruments if there is a change to the interest rates used for discounting, margining or contract price alignment. These amendments are effective immediately and may be applied prospectively to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated on or before December 31, 2022. We are currently evaluating our contracts and the optional expedients provided by the new standard. No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had, or is expected to have, a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 3. Segment Information Under U.S. GAAP, our operating segments are aggregated into five reportable segments: 1) Beauty, 2) Grooming, 3) Health Care, 4) Fabric & Home Care and 5) Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Our five reportable segments are comprised of: • Beauty : Hair Care (Conditioners, Shampoos, Styling Aids, Treatments); Skin and Personal Care (Antiperspirants and Deodorants, Personal Cleansing, Skin Care); • Grooming : Shave Care (Female Blades & Razors, Male Blades & Razors, Pre- and Post-Shave Products, Other Shave Care); Appliances; • Health Care : Oral Care (Toothbrushes, Toothpaste, Other Oral Care); Personal Health Care (Gastrointestinal, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements, Pain Relief, Other Personal Health Care); • Fabric & Home Care : Fabric Care (Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Additives, Laundry Detergents); Home Care (Air Care, Dish Care, P&G Professional, Surface Care); and • Baby, Feminine & Family Care : Baby Care (Baby Wipes, Taped Diapers and Pants); Feminine Care (Adult Incontinence, Feminine Care); Family Care (Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper).

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill is allocated by reportable segment as follows: Beauty Grooming Health Care Fabric & Home Care Baby, Feminine & Family Care Total Company Goodwill at June 30, 2020 $ 12,902 $ 12,815 $ 7,786 $ 1,841 $ 4,557 $ 39,901 Translation and other 254 206 159 24 68 711 Goodwill at March 31, 2021 $ 13,156 $ 13,021 $ 7,945 $ 1,865 $ 4,625 $ 40,612 Goodwill increased from June 30, 2020 due to currency translation. Identifiable intangible assets at March 31, 2021 were comprised of: Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Intangible assets with determinable lives $ 8,574 $ ( 6,005 ) Intangible assets with indefinite lives 21,089 — Total identifiable intangible assets $ 29,663 $ ( 6,005 ) Intangible assets with determinable lives consist of brands, patents, technology and customer relationships. The intangible assets with indefinite lives consist of brands. The amortization expense of determinable-lived intangible assets for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 was $ 78 and $ 87 , respectively. For the nine months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, the amortization expense was $ 241 and $ 274 , respectively. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment by comparing the estimated fair values of our reporting units and underlying indefinite-lived intangible assets to their respective carrying values. We typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of these assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. If the resulting fair value is less than the asset's carrying value, that difference represents an impairment. Our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets occurs during the three months ended December 31. The business unit valuations used to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment depend on a number of significant estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment, margin expansion and Company business plans. We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable. However, future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount rates, tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. To the extent changes in such factors result in a failure to achieve the level of projected cash flows initially used to estimate fair value for purposes of establishing or subsequently impairing the carrying amount of goodwill and related intangible assets, we may need to record non-cash impairment charges in the future. Most of our goodwill reporting units are comprised of a combination of legacy and acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that, at a minimum, exceed two times their underlying carrying values. Certain of our goodwill reporting units, in particular Shave Care and Appliances, are comprised entirely of acquired businesses and as a result, have fair value cushions that are not as high. The Appliances reporting unit has a fair value that significantly exceeds the underlying carrying value. As previously disclosed, the carrying value of the Shave Care reporting unit and the related Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset were impaired during the quarter ended June 30, 2019. Also, as previously disclosed, the Shave Care reporting unit fair value exceeded its carrying value by more than 20 % and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset fair value approximated its carrying value as of our fiscal 2020 impairment testing dates. Based on our impairment testing during the three months ended December 31, 2020, the Shave Care reporting unit fair value continued to exceed its carrying value by more than 20 % and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset's fair value continued to approximate its carrying value. The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the net sales and earnings growth rates (including residual growth rates) and the discount rate. The residual growth rate represents the expected rate at which the Shave Care reporting unit and Gillette brand are expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period. The residual growth rate utilized in our fair value estimates is consistent with the reporting unit and brand operating plans and approximates expected long-term category market growth rates. The residual growth rate depends on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, relative currency exchange rates and business activities that impact market share. As a result, the residual growth rate could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes, devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or an increased competitive environment. The discount rate, which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, such as further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar. Currency spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the U.S. While management can and has implemented strategies to address these events, changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that would trigger future impairment charges of the Shave Care reporting unit's goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. The duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic could also result in future impairment charges for the Shave Care reporting unit goodwill and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset. While we have concluded that a triggering event did not occur during the quarter ended March 31, 2021, the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is most susceptible to future impairment risk. Our assessment of the Gillette intangible asset assumes the pandemic’s impact on net sales growth rates will be largely eliminated by the end of the fiscal year. There continues to be a high level of uncertainty relating to how the pandemic will evolve, how governments and consumers will react and progress on the distribution of vaccines. Accordingly, there continues to be risk related to this key assumption. A more prolonged pandemic recovery period could impact the assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset that are significant enough to trigger an impairment. Net sales and earnings growth rates could be negatively impacted by reductions or changes in demand for our shave care products, which may be caused by, among other things: the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine or other travel restrictions, or financial hardship, or by shifts in demand away from one or more of our higher priced products to lower priced products. In addition, relative global and country/regional macroeconomic factors could result in additional and prolonged devaluation of other countries’ currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Finally, the discount rate utilized in our valuation model could be impacted by changes in the underlying interest rates and risk premiums included in the determination of the cost of capital. As of March 31, 2021, the carrying values of the Shave Care goodwill and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset were $ 12.7 billion and $ 14.1 billion, respectively. We performed a sensitivity analysis for the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset during our annual impairment testing, utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the shorter-term and residual growth rates and the discount rate, to demonstrate the potential impacts to the estimated fair values. The table below provides, in isolation, the estimated fair value impacts related to a 25 basis-point increase in the discount rate or a 25 basis-point decrease in our shorter-term and residual growth rates, either of which, in isolation, would result in an impairment of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset. Approximate Percent Change in Estimated Fair Value +25 bps Discount Rate -25 bps Growth Rates Shave Care goodwill reporting unit ( 6 ) % ( 6 ) % Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset ( 6 ) % ( 6 ) % Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. 5. Earnings Per Share Basic net earnings per common share are calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble less preferred dividends (net of related tax benefits) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net earnings per common share are calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble by the diluted weighted average number of common shares during the period. The diluted shares include the dilutive effect of stock options and other stock-based awards based on the treasury stock method and the assumed conversion of preferred stock. Net earnings per share were calculated as follows: CONSOLIDATED AMOUNTS Three Months Ended March 31 Nine Months Ended March 31 2021 2020 2021 2020 Net earnings $ 3,249 $ 2,957 $ 11,444 $ 10,317 Less: Net earnings/(loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests ( 20 ) 40 44 90 Net earnings attributable to P&G (Diluted) 3,269 2,917 11,400 10,227 Less: Preferred dividends, net of tax 65 64 197 193 Net earnings attributable to P&G available to common shareholders (Basic) $ 3,204 $ 2,853 $ 11,203 $ 10,034 SHARES IN MILLIONS Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 2,459.1 2,476.2 2,473.7 2,489.1 Add: Effect of dilutive securities Conversion of preferred shares (1) 82.3 85.5 83.1 86.4 Impact of stock options and other unvested equity awards (2) 48.9 51.6 53.6 54.8 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 2,590.3 2,613.3 2,610.4 2,630.3 NET EARNINGS PER SHARE (3) Basic $ 1.30 $ 1.15 $ 4.53 $ 4.03 Diluted $ 1.26 $ 1.12 $ 4.37 $ 3.89 (1) Despite being included currently in Diluted net earnings per common share, the actual conversion to common stock occurs when the preferred shares are sold. Shares may only be sold after being allocated to the ESOP participants pursuant to the repayment of the ESOP's obligations through 2035. (2) Weighted average outstanding stock options of approximately 12 million and 7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, and approximately 8 million and 3 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, were not included in the Diluted net earnings per share calculation because the options were out of the money or to do so would have been antidilutive (i.e., the total proceeds upon exercise would have exceeded the market value of the underlying common shares). (3) Net earnings per share are calculated on Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble. 6. Share-Based Compensation and Postretirement Benefits The following table provides a summary of our share-based compensation expense and postretirement benefit costs: Three Months Ended March 31 Nine Months Ended March 31 2021 2020 2021 2020 Share-based compensation expense $ 144 $ 123 $ 398 $ 325 Net periodic benefit cost for pension benefits (1) 48 42 141 126 Net periodic benefit credit for other retiree benefits (1) ( 80 ) ( 52 ) ( 240 ) ( 156 ) (1) The components of the total net periodic benefit cost/(credit) for both pension benefits and other retiree benefits for these interim periods, on an annualized basis, do not differ materially from the amounts disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. 7. Risk Management Activities and Fair Value Measurements As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. There have been no significant changes in our risk management policies or activities during the nine months ended March 31, 2021. The Company has not changed its valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period. The Company recognizes transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of each quarter. There were no transfers between levels during the periods presented. Also, there was no significant activity within the Level 3 assets and liabilities during the periods presented. There were no significant assets or liabilities that were remeasured at fair value on a non-recurring basis for the nine months ended March 31, 2021. Cash equivalents were $ 8.5 billion and $ 14.6 billion as of March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2020, respectively, and are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. Other investments had a fair value of $ 132 and $ 67 as of March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2020, respectively, including equity securities of $ 104 and $ 39 as of March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2020, respectively, and are presented in Other noncurrent assets. Investments are measured at fair value and primarily classified as Level 1 and Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Level 1 are based on quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets, and Level 2 are based on quoted market prices for similar instruments. There are no material investment balances classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy or using net asset value as a practical expedient. Unrealized gains on equity securities were $ 58 during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2021 and not significant for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2020. These unrealized gains are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in Other non-operating income/(expense), net. The fair value of long-term debt was $ 26.4 billion and $ 29.0 billion as of March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2020, respectively. This includes the current portion of long-term debt instruments ($ 3.6 billion and $ 2.5 billion as of March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2020, respectively). Certain long-term debt (debt designated as a fair value hedge) is recorded at fair value. All other long-term debt is recorded at amortized cost but is measured at fair value for disclosure purposes. We consider our debt to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Fair values are generally estimated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments. Disclosures about Financial Instruments The notional amounts and fair values of financial instruments used in hedging transactions as of March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2020 are as follows: Notional Amount Fair Value Asset Fair Value (Liability) March 31, 2021 June 30, 2020 March 31, 2021 June 30, 2020 March 31, 2021 June 30, 2020 DERIVATIVES IN FAIR VALUE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Interest rate contracts $ 7,327 $ 7,114 $ 174 $ 269 $ — $ — DERIVATIVES IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Foreign currency interest rate contracts $ 7,375 $ 3,856 $ 97 $ 26 $ ( 92 ) $ ( 41 ) TOTAL DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS $ 14,702 $ 10,970 $ 271 $ 295 $ ( 92 ) $ ( 41 ) DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS Foreign currency contracts $ 6,375 $ 5,986 $ 7 $ 23 $ ( 70 ) $ ( 25 ) TOTAL DERIVATIVES AT FAIR VALUE $ 21,077 $ 16,956 $ 278 $ 318 $ ( 162 ) $ ( 66 ) The fair value of the interest rate derivative asset/(liability) directly offsets the cumulative amount of the fair value hedging adjustment included in the carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation. The carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation, which includes the unamortized discount or premium and the fair value adjustment, was $ 7.5 billion and $ 7.4 billion as of March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2020, respectively. In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges. The carrying value of those debt instruments designated as net investment hedges, which includes the adjustment for the foreign currency transaction gain or loss on those instruments, was $ 11.8 billion and $ 16.0 billion as of March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2020, respectively. The increase in the notional balance of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges is offset by the decrease in the principal balance of debt instruments designated as net investment hedges, reflecting the Company’s decision to leverage favorable interest rates in the foreign currency swap market versus the short-term debt market. All derivative assets are presented in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Other noncurrent assets. All derivative liabilities are presented in Accrued and other liabilities or Other noncurrent liabilities. Changes in the fair value of net Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. investment hedges are recognized in the Foreign currency translation component of Other comprehensive income (OCI). All of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Before tax gains/(losses) on our financial instruments in hedging relationships are categorized as follows: Amount of Gain/(Loss) Recognized in OCI on Derivatives Three Months Ended March 31 Nine Months Ended March 31 2021 2020 2021 2020 DERIVATIVES IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS (1) (2) Foreign exchange contracts $ 393 $ 83 $ ( 145 ) $ 114 (1) For the derivatives in net investment hedging relationships, the amount of gain excluded from effectiveness testing, which was recognized in earnings, was $ 15 and $ 17 for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The amount of gain excluded from effectiveness testing was $ 45 and $ 57 for the nine months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. (2) In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges. The amount of gain recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (AOCI) for such instruments was $ 509 and $ 306 for the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The amount of gain/(loss) recognized in AOCI for such instruments was $( 732 ) and $ 487 for the nine months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Amount of Gain/(Loss) Recognized in Earnings Three Months Ended March 31 Nine Months Ended March 31 2021 2020 2021 2020 DERIVATIVES IN FAIR VALUE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Interest rate contracts $ ( 100 ) $ 109 $ ( 95 ) $ 56 DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS Foreign currency contracts $ ( 87 ) $ ( 148 ) $ 221 $ ( 160 ) The gain/(loss) on the derivatives in fair value hedging relationships is fully offset by the mark-to-market impact of the related exposure. These are both recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in Interest expense. The gain/(loss) on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is substantially offset by the currency mark-to-market of the related exposure. These are both recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A). 8. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss) The table below presents the changes in AOCI, including the reclassifications out of AOCI by component: Investment Securities Post-retirement Benefits Foreign Currency Translation Total AOCI Balance at June 30, 2020 $ ( 1 ) $ ( 4,350 ) $ ( 11,814 ) $ ( 16,165 ) OCI before reclassifications (1) 17 ( 225 ) 639 431 Amounts reclassified from AOCI into the Consolidated Statements of Earnings (2) 2 249 — 251 Net current period OCI 19 24 639 682 Less: Other comprehensive income/(loss) attributable to non-controlling interests — ( 1 ) 7 6 Balance at March 31, 2021 $ 18 $ ( 4,325 ) $ ( 11,182 ) $ ( 15,489 ) (1) Net of tax expense/(benefit) of $ 0 , $( 65 ) and $( 206 ) for gains/losses on investment securities, postretirement benefit items and foreign currency translation, respectively. (2) Net of tax expense/(benefit) of $ 0 , $ 77 and $ 0 for gains/losses on investment securities, postretirement benefit items and foreign currency translation, respectively. The below provides additional details on amounts reclassified from AOCI into the Consolidated Statements of Earnings: • Investment securities: amounts reclassified from AOCI into Other non-operating income, net. • Postretirement benefits: amounts reclassified from AOCI into Other non-operating income, net and included in the computation of net periodic postretirement costs. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. 9. Restructuring Program The Company has historically incurred an ongoing annual level of restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Before-tax costs incurred under the ongoing program have generally ranged from $ 250 to $ 500 annually. In fiscal 2017, the Company announced specific elements of an additional multi-year productivity and cost savings plan to further reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, certain marketing activities and overhead expenses, which resulted in incremental restructuring charges through fiscal 2020. We expect fiscal 2021 restructuring charges to be more in line with our ongoing level of spending noted above. Restructuring costs incurred consist primarily of costs to separate employees, asset-related costs to exit facilities and other costs. Employee separation costs relate to severance packages that were primarily voluntary, and the amounts were calculated based on salary levels and past service periods. Severance costs related to voluntary separations are generally charged to earnings when the employee accepts the offer. Asset-related costs consist of both asset write-downs and accelerated depreciation. Asset write-downs relate to the establishment of a new fair value basis for assets held-for-sale or disposal. These assets were written down to the lower of their current carrying basis or amounts expected to be realized upon disposal, less minor disposal costs. Charges for accelerated depreciation relate to long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period. These assets relate primarily to manufacturing consolidations and technology standardizations. The asset-related charges will not have a significant impact on future depreciation charges. Other restructuring-type charges are incurred as a direct result of the restructuring program. Such charges primarily include asset removal and termination of contracts related to supply chain and overhead optimization. The following table presents restructuring activity for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2021. The majority of the remaining reserve balance as of March 31, 2021 relates to employee separations. Reserve Balance Previously Reported (Six Months Ended December 31, 2020) Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 Nine Months Ended March 31, 2021 Reserve Balance June 30, 2020 Cost Incurred and Charged to Expense Cost Incurred and Charged to Expense Cost Paid/Settled March 31, 2021 Total $ 472 $ 87 $ 134 $ ( 423 ) $ 270 10. Commitments and Contingencies Litigation We are subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental, patent and trademark matters, labor and employment matters and tax. While considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management and our counsel, the ultimate resolution of the various lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior manufacturing and waste disposal practices. Based on currently available information, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of environmental remediation will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Income Tax Uncertainties The Company is present in approximately 70 countries and over 150 taxable jurisdictions and, at any point in time, has 40 – 50 jurisdictional audits underway at various stages of completion. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite our belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitations. Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate. We have tax years open ranging from 2008 and forward. We are generally not able to reliably estimate the ultimate settlement amounts until the close of the audit. Based on information currently available, we anticipate that over the next 12 month period, audit activity could be completed related to uncertain tax positions in multiple jurisdictions for which we have accrued existing liabilities of approximately $ 60 , including interest and penalties. Additional information on the Commitments and Contingencies of the Company can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended June 30, 2020. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. Item 2.

A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected herein, is included in the section titled ""Economic Conditions and Uncertainties"" and the section titled ""Risk Factors"" (Part II, Item 1A) of this Form 10-Q. The purpose of Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is to provide an understanding of Procter & Gamble's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. The MD&A is organized in the following sections: • Overview • Summary of Results – Nine Months Ended March 31, 2021 • Economic Conditions and Uncertainties • Results of Operations – Three and Nine Months Ended March 31, 2021 • Business Segment Discussion – Three and Nine Months Ended March 31, 2021 • Liquidity and Capital Resources • Reconciliation of Measures Not Defined by U.S. GAAP Throughout the MD&A, we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales and net earnings. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), consisting of organic sales growth, core net earnings per share (Core EPS), adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity. The explanation at the end of the MD&A provides the definition of these non-GAAP measures, details on the use and the derivation of these measures, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures. Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and market consumption in the MD&A are based on a combination of vendor purchased traditional brick-and-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales of our products in dollar terms on a constant currency basis, relative to all product sales in the category. The Company measures fiscal year to date market shares through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months as compared to the end of the reporting period. Management also uses unit volume growth to evaluate and explain drivers of changes in net sales. Organic volume growth reflects year-over-year changes in unit volume excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and certain one-time items if applicable and is used to explain changes in organic sales. OVERVIEW P&G is a global leader in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories, primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, baby stores, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores and professional channels. We also sell direct to consumers. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries. Our market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We believe we are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position. The table below provides detail on our reportable segments, including the product categories and brand composition within each segment.

The following table provides the percentage of net sales and net earnings by reportable business segment for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2021 (excluding net sales and net earnings in Corporate): Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 Nine Months Ended March 31, 2021 Net Sales Net Earnings Net Sales Net Earnings Beauty 18% 19% 19% 22% Grooming 8% 8% 9% 9% Health Care 13% 12% 13% 13% Fabric & Home Care 35% 33% 34% 31% Baby, Feminine & Family Care 26% 28% 25% 25% Total Company 100% 100% 100% 100% SUMMARY OF RESULTS The following are highlights of results for the nine months ended March 31, 2021 versus the nine months ended March 31, 2020: • Net sales increased 7% to $57.2 billion, driven by double digit increase in Fabric & Home Care, high single digit increases in Beauty and Health Care, mid-single digits increase in Grooming and low single digits increase in Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, also increased 7%. Organic sales increased double digits in Fabric & Home Care, increased high single digits in Health Care, increased mid-single digits in Beauty and Grooming and increased low single digits in Baby, Feminine & Family Care. • Net earnings were $11.4 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion or 11% versus the prior year period due to the increase in net sales and an increase in operating margins, partially offset by an increase in the effective tax rate and current year charges of $512 million for early debt extinguishment. • Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $1.2 billion or 11% versus the prior year period to $11.4 billion. • Diluted net earnings per share (EPS) increased 12% to $4.37 due primarily to the increase in net earnings. • Core net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble, which represents net earnings excluding charges for the early extinguishment of debt in the current period and incremental restructuring charges in the base period, increased 14% to $11.8 billion. Core net earnings per share increased 14% to $4.53 versus the prior year due primarily to the increase in Core net earnings. • Operating cash flow was $14.3 billion. Adjusted free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less capital expenditures and certain other impacts, was $12.4 billion. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 104%. ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES Global Economic Conditions . Our products are sold in numerous countries across North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa with more than half our sales generated outside the United States. As such, we are exposed to and impacted by global macro-economic factors, U.S. and foreign government policies and foreign exchange fluctuations. Current global economic conditions are highly volatile due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in both market size contractions in certain countries due to economic slowdowns and government restrictions on movement, as well as market size increases in certain countries due to increased consumption of household cleaning and personal health and hygiene products by consumers. Other macro-economic factors also remain dynamic, and any causes of market size contraction, such as reduced GDP in commodity-dependent economies, greater political unrest or instability in the Middle East, Central & Eastern Europe, certain Latin American markets, the Hong Kong market in Greater China and the Korean peninsula could reduce our net sales or erode our operating margin, in either case reducing our net earnings and cash flows. Changes in Costs. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, transportation costs and our own productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities, in particular, certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp, and volatility in the market price of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs. Disruptions in our manufacturing, supply and distribution operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic may also impact our costs. If we are unable to manage these impacts through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions, as well as through consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. Net sales could also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on consumption of our products. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including outsourcing projects, supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. In fiscal 2017, we communicated specific elements of a multi-year cost reduction program which has resulted in targeted enrollment reductions and other savings. If we are not successful in executing and sustaining these changes, there could be a negative impact on our gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. Foreign Exchange . We have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates. Translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation of transaction-related working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. In the past two fiscal years, as well as the current fiscal year, the U.S. dollar has strengthened versus a number of foreign currencies, leading to lower sales and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts. Certain countries experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations, like Argentina, Brazil, Russia, Turkey, the United Kingdom, China as well as the European Union have previously had, and could in the future have, a significant impact on our net sales, costs and net earnings. Increased pricing in response to certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could also have a negative impact on consumption of our products, which would affect our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. Government Policies . Our net earnings and cash flows could be materially affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government legislative, regulatory or enforcement policies. For example, any future tax regulatory guidance issued as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017 (the U.S. Tax Act) or other changes in U.S. tax policies, or any significant change in global tax policy adopted under the current work being led by the OECD for the G20 focused on ""Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy."" The breadth of the OECD project extends beyond pure digital businesses and is likely to impact all multinational businesses by redefining jurisdictional taxation rights. Further, our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows may be impacted by changes in U.S. and foreign government policies related to environmental and climate change matters. Additionally, we attempt to carefully manage our debt, currency and other exposures in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and pricing controls, such as Nigeria, Algeria, Egypt, Argentina and Turkey. Further, our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes to international trade agreements in North America and elsewhere, including increases of import tariffs, both currently effective and future potential changes. Changes in government policies in these areas might cause an increase or decrease in our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. COVID-19 Pandemic Disclosures . Our net sales, net earnings and cash flows may be impacted by U.S. and foreign government policies to manage the COVID-19 pandemic, such as movement restrictions or site closures. The Company’s priorities during the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be protecting the health and safety of our employees; maximizing the availability of products that help consumers with their health, hygiene and cleaning needs; and, using our employees’ talents and our resources to help society meet and overcome the current challenges. Because the Company sells products that are essential to the daily lives of consumers, the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a materially negative impact to our consolidated net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. The pandemic has had both positive and negative impacts to our net sales and net earnings during the three and nine month periods ended March 31, 2021. We have experienced a significant increase in demand and consumption of certain of our product categories (fabric, home cleaning and hygiene products) primarily in North America, caused in part by changing consumer habits, pantry stocking and retailer inventory replenishment, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, contributing to increases in net sales, net earnings and cash flows. At the same time, we experienced a decrease in net sales due to the economic slowdown and restricted consumer movements in certain regions, including IMEA (India, Middle East and Africa) and Asia Pacific, in certain channels, including travel retail and professional, and in certain of our beauty and grooming products. In the future, the pandemic may cause reduced demand for our products if it results in a recessionary global economic environment. Demand in certain countries in Latin America, Asia Pacific, and IMEA may be particularly susceptible to recession. It could also lead to volatility in consumer access to our products due to government actions impacting our ability to produce and ship products or impacting consumers’ movements and access to our products. We believe that over the long term, there will continue to be strong demand for categories in which we operate, particularly our products that deliver essential health, hygiene and cleaning benefits. However, the timing and extent of demand recovery in certain markets in Asia Pacific, IMEA and Latin America, the resumption of international travel, the timing and impact of potential consumer pantry destocking in markets including North America and Europe, and product demand volatility caused by future economic trends are unclear. Accordingly, there may be heightened volatility in net sales, net earnings and cash flows during and subsequent to the duration of the pandemic. Our retail customers are also being impacted by the pandemic. Their success in addressing the issues and maintaining their operations could impact consumer access to, and as a result, sales of our products. Our ability to continue to operate without any significant negative impacts will in part depend on our ability to protect our employees and our supply chain. The Company has endeavored to follow actions recommended by governments and health authorities, including on vaccine administration, to protect our employees world-wide, with particular measures in place for those working in our plants and distribution facilities. We have also worked closely with local and national officials to keep our manufacturing facilities open due to the essential nature of the majority of our products. While we have been able to broadly maintain our operations, we experienced some disruption in our supply chain in certain markets in Asia Pacific and IMEA in the first months of the pandemic due primarily to the restriction of employee movements as well as increased transportation and manufacturing costs. We intend to continue to work with government authorities and implement our employee safety measures to ensure that we continue manufacturing and distributing our products during the pandemic. However, uncertainty resulting from the pandemic could result in an unforeseen disruption to our supply chain (for example, a closure of a key manufacturing or distribution facility or the inability of a key material or transportation supplier to source and transport materials) that could impact our operations. Because the pandemic has not had a material negative impact on our operations or demand for our products and resulting net sales and net earnings, it has also not negatively impacted the Company’s liquidity position. We continue to generate operating cash flows to meet our short-term liquidity needs, and we have maintained access to the capital markets enabled by our strong short- and long-term credit ratings. We have also not observed any material impairments of our assets or a significant change in the fair value of assets due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 The following discussion provides a review of results for the three months ended March 31, 2021 versus the three months ended March 31, 2020. Three Months Ended March 31 Amounts in millions, except per share amounts 2021 2020 % Chg Net sales $18,109 $17,214 5% Operating income 3,785 3,453 10% Net earnings 3,249 2,957 10% Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 3,269 2,917 12% Diluted net earnings per common share 1.26 1.12 13% Core net earnings per common share 1.26 1.17 8% Three Months Ended March 31 COMPARISONS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES 2021 2020 Basis Pt Chg Gross margin 50.7% 49.4% 130 Selling, general & administrative expense 29.8% 29.3% 50 Operating income 20.9% 20.1% 80 Earnings before income taxes 21.4% 20.3% 110 Net earnings 17.9% 17.2% 70 Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 18.1% 16.9% 120 Net Sales Net sales for the quarter increased 5% to $18.1 billion while unit volume was unchanged. Increased pricing had a 2% positive impact to net sales. Mix had a 2% positive impact to net sales, driven by the disproportionate growth of the North America region, the Home Care, Appliances and Oral Care businesses, and super premium products within Skin and Personal Care, all of which have higher than company-average selling prices. Favorable foreign exchange had a 1% positive impact on net sales. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, organic sales increased 4% while organic volume was unchanged. Net sales increased high single digits in Beauty and Fabric & Home Care, increased mid-single digits in Grooming and Health Care and was unchanged in Baby, Feminine & Family Care. On a regional basis, volume increased double digits in Greater China and increased low single digits in North America and IMEA, partially offset by a mid-single digits decrease in Europe and a low single digit decrease in Asia Pacific. Volume was unchanged in Latin America.

(2) Other includes the sales mix impact from acquisitions and divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile volume to net sales. Operating Costs Gross margin increased 130 basis points to 50.7% of net sales for the quarter. Gross margin benefited from: • 120 basis points of gross manufacturing cost savings projects (90 basis points net of product and packaging reinvestments), • 80 basis points of help from higher pricing, and • 100 basis points of help due to lower restructuring costs versus the base period These benefits were partially offset by a 60 basis point decline from unfavorable mix (due to the disproportionate growth of the Home Care and Appliances categories which have lower than company-average margins) and other impacts, a 50 basis-point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange and a 30 basis-point decline due to higher commodity costs. Total SG&A spending increased 7% to $5.4 billion due to increases in both marketing spending and overhead costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased 50 basis points to 29.8% due to an increase in marketing spending and overhead costs as a percentage of net sales. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales increased 50 basis points due to investments in media, partially offset by the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and savings in agency compensation, production costs and advertising spending. Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales increased 20 basis points primarily due to inflation and other cost increases and higher restructuring charges versus the base period, partially offset by the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and productivity savings. Other net operating costs as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points due to a reduction in foreign exchange transactional charges. Productivity-driven cost savings delivered 90 basis points of benefit to SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Non-Operating Expenses and Income Interest expense was $106 million for the quarter, a nominal increase versus the prior year period. Interest income was $11 million for the quarter, a $28 million decrease versus the prior year period due to lower U.S. interest rates. Other non-operating income was $187 million, an increase of $81 million primarily due to an unrealized gain on an equity investment that became publicly traded in the current period. Income Taxes For the three months ended March 31, 2021, the effective tax rate increased 70 basis points versus the prior year period to 16.2% due to: • a 100 basis-point increase from lower excess tax benefits of share-based compensation (180 basis-point reduction in the current period versus 280 basis-point reduction in the prior year period), • a 150 basis-point increase related to the prior year tax benefit arising from transactions to simplify our legal entity structure, and • a 10 basis-point increase from unfavorable impacts from the geographic mix of current year earnings. These increases are partially offset by: • a 155 basis-point decrease from higher current period deductions for foreign-derived intangible income, and • a 35 basis-point decrease from discrete impacts related to uncertain tax positions (65 basis-point favorable impact in the current year versus a 30 basis-point favorable impact in the prior year period). Net Earnings Operating income increased $332 million, or 10%, to $3.8 billion for the quarter, due to the net sales increase and the increase in gross margin, partially offset by the increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales, all of which are described above. Net earnings increased $292 million, or 10%, to $3.2 billion as the increases in operating income and other non-operating income discussed above were partially offset by the increase in income taxes. Foreign exchange had a nominally positive impact on net earnings for the quarter, including both transactional charges and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars. Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $352 million, or 12%, to $3.3 billion for the quarter. Diluted net earnings per share increased 13% to $1.26 versus the base period due to the increase in net earnings and a reduction in the weighted average number of shares outstanding. Diluted net EPS increased 8% versus the base period Core EPS which represents diluted net earnings per share excluding incremental restructuring charges in the base period related to our productivity and cost savings plans. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Nine Months Ended March 31, 2021 The following discussion provides a review of results for the nine months ended March 31, 2021 versus the nine months ended March 31, 2020. Nine Months Ended March 31 Amounts in millions, except per share amounts 2021 2020 % Chg Net sales $57,172 $53,252 7% Operating income 14,446 12,225 18% Net earnings 11,444 10,317 11% Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 11,400 10,227 11% Diluted net earnings per common share 4.37 3.89 12% Core net earnings per common share 4.53 3.96 14% Nine Months Ended March 31 COMPARISONS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES 2021 2020 Basis Pt Chg Gross margin 52.2% 50.6% 160 Selling, general & administrative expense 27.0% 27.6% (60) Operating income 25.3% 23.0% 230 Earnings before income taxes 24.6% 23.2% 140 Net earnings 20.0% 19.4% 60 Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 19.9% 19.2% 70 Net Sales Net sales for the nine months ended March 31, 2021 increased 7% to $57.2 billion on a 4% increase in unit volume. Increased pricing had a 1% positive impact to net sales. Mix had a 2% positive impact to net sales driven by the disproportionate growth of the North America region and the Home Care and Appliances categories, all of which have higher than company-average selling prices. Foreign exchange had no net impact on net sales. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, organic sales also increased 7% on a 4% increase in organic volume. Net sales increased double digits in Fabric & Home Care, increased high single digits in Beauty and Health Care, increased mid-single digits in Grooming and increased low single digits in Baby, Feminine & Family Care. On a regional basis, volume increased high single digits in North America and in Greater China driven by innovation and increased demand, particularly in household cleaning and personal hygiene products due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic. Volume increased low single digits in Latin America and IMEA, partially offset by a low single digits decrease in Asia Pacific. Volume was unchanged in Europe. Net Sales Change Drivers 2021 vs. 2020 (Nine Months Ended March 31) (1) Volume with Acquisitions & Divestitures Volume Excluding Acquisitions & Divestitures Foreign Exchange Price Mix Other (2) Net Sales Growth Beauty 4% 4% —% 2% 1% —% 7% Grooming 3% 3% (1)% 2% 1% —% 5% Health Care 4% 4% —% 1% 3% —% 8% Fabric & Home Care 7% 7% —% 1% 3% —% 11% Baby, Feminine & Family Care 1% 1% —% 1% 1% —% 3% Total Company 4% 4% —% 1% 2% —% 7% (1) Net sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied. (2) Other includes the sales mix impact from acquisitions and divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile volume to net sales. Operating Costs Gross margin increased 160 basis points to 52.2% of net sales for the fiscal year to date period. Gross margin benefited from: • 140 basis points of gross manufacturing cost savings projects (120 basis points net of product and packaging reinvestments), • 60 basis points of help from higher pricing, • 50 basis points of help due to lower restructuring costs versus the base period, and • 20 basis points of lower commodity costs These benefits were partially offset by a 50 basis-point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange and a 40 basis point decline from unfavorable mix (due to the disproportionate growth of Home Care and Appliances categories which have lower than company-average margins, as well as mix within segments due to the growth of lower margin product forms and large sizes in certain categories) and other impacts. Total SG&A spending increased 5% to $15.4 billion primarily due to increases in both marketing spending and overhead costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 60 basis points to 27% primarily due to a reduction in overhead costs as a percentage of net sales. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales was unchanged as the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and savings in agency compensation, production costs and advertising spending, were offset by reinvestments in media. Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales declined 40 basis points due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and productivity savings, partially offset by higher restructuring costs versus the base period, inflation and other cost increases. Other net operating costs as a percentage of net sales decreased 20 basis points due to a reduction in foreign exchange transactional charges. Productivity-driven cost savings delivered 100 basis points of benefit to SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Non-Operating Expenses and Income Interest expense was $385 million for the fiscal year to date, an increase of $77 million versus the prior year period due to higher average interest rates driven by a higher proportion of fixed rate debt. Interest income was $30 million for the fiscal year to date, a $103 million decrease versus the prior year period due to lower U.S. interest rates. Other non-operating expense was $40 million, a change of $363 million versus the prior year non-operating income of $323 million, primarily due to current period charges of $512 million for early debt extinguishment ($427 million after tax), partially offset by an unrealized gain on an equity investment that became publicly traded in the current period and an increase in net non-operating benefits on defined benefit retirement plans caused by annual updates to actuarial assumptions. Income Taxes For the nine months ended March 31, 2021, the effective tax rate increased 200 basis points versus the prior year period to 18.6% due to: • a 70 basis-point increase from unfavorable impacts from the geographic mix of current year earnings, caused primarily by disproportionately higher sales and earnings in the U.S., • a 130 basis-point increase related to the prior year tax benefit arising from transactions to simplify our legal entity structure, • a 10 basis-point increase from the impact of the early extinguishment of debt in the current year, and • a 10 basis-point increase from lower excess tax benefits of share-based compensation (170 basis-point reduction in the current period versus 180 basis-point reduction in the prior year period). These increases are partially offset by: • a 10 basis-point decrease from the higher current period deduction for foreign-derived intangible income, and • a 10 basis-point decrease from discrete impacts related to uncertain tax positions (25 basis-point favorable impact in the current year versus a 15 basis-point favorable impact in the prior year period). Net Earnings Operating income increased $2.2 billion, or 18%, to $14.4 billion for the nine months ended March 31, 2021, due to the net sales increase, the increase in gross margin and the decrease in SG&A as a percentage of sales, all of which are described above. Net earnings increased $1.1 billion, or 11%, to $11.4 billion for the fiscal year to date period primarily due to the increase in operating income, partially offset by the increase in other non-operating expense (driven by the early debt extinguishment charge) and the increase in the effective tax rate. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of approximately $168 million on net earnings for the fiscal year to date period, including both transactional charges and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars. Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $1.2 billion, or 11%, to $11.4 billion for the fiscal year to date period. Diluted net earnings per share increased 12% to $4.37. Core net earnings per share increased 14% to $4.53. Core EPS represents diluted net earnings per share excluding current period charges for the early extinguishment of debt and incremental restructuring charges in the base period related to our productivity and cost savings plans. BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSION – Three and Nine Months Ended March 31, 2021 The following discussion provides a review of results by reportable business segment. Analysis of the results for the three- and nine month-periods ended March 31, 2021 is provided based on a comparison to the same three- and nine-month periods ended March 31, 2020. The primary financial measures used to evaluate segment performance are net sales and net earnings. The table below provides supplemental information on net sales, earnings before income taxes and net earnings by reportable business segment for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2021 versus the comparable prior year period (dollar amounts in millions): Three Months Ended March 31, 2021 Net Sales % Change Versus Year Ago Earnings/(Loss) Before Income Taxes % Change Versus Year Ago Net Earnings % Change Versus Year Ago Beauty $ 3,316 9 % $ 721 30 % $ 577 32 % Grooming 1,438 4 % 314 3 % 256 1 % Health Care 2,356 4 % 484 (7) % 377 (8) % Fabric & Home Care 6,275 8 % 1,348 6 % 1,027 7 % Baby, Feminine & Family Care 4,604 — % 1,133 — % 871 1 % Corporate 120 N/A (123) N/A 141 N/A Total Company $ 18,109 5 % $ 3,877 11 % $ 3,249 10 % Nine Months Ended March 31, 2021 Net Sales % Change Versus Year Ago Earnings/(Loss) Before Income Taxes % Change Versus Year Ago Net Earnings % Change Versus Year Ago Beauty $ 10,907 7 % $ 3,145 16 % $ 2,508 16 % Grooming 4,774 5 % 1,277 4 % 1,063 4 % Health Care 7,573 8 % 1,993 11 % 1,557 13 % Fabric & Home Care 19,417 11 % 4,689 21 % 3,626 23 % Baby, Feminine & Family Care 14,185 3 % 3,803 14 % 2,924 15 % Corporate 316 N/A (856) N/A (234) N/A Total Company $ 57,172 7 % $ 14,051 14 % $ 11,444 11 % Beauty Three months ended March 31, 2021 compared with three months ended March 31, 2020 Beauty net sales increased 9% to $3.3 billion during the third fiscal quarter on a 2% increase in unit volume. Higher pricing increased net sales by 2%. Favorable mix added 3% to net sales due to the disproportionate growth of the super premium SKII brand. Foreign exchange impacts increased net sales by 2%. Organic sales increased 7%. Global market share of the Beauty segment decreased 0.5 points. • Hair Care net sales increased high single digits due to a mid-single digit increase in volumes and devaluation-related price increases. Organic sales also increased high single digits. The volume increase was driven by a more than 20% increase in Greater China (due to distribution growth and lower base period volume caused by pandemic-related shutdowns) and high single digits increase in North America (due to innovation and lower base period volume caused by pandemic-related supply constraints). Volume also increased double digits in IMEA and increased low single digits in Latin America due to innovation, partially offset by double digit decline in Europe due to category declines and devaluation related price increases in certain markets. Global market share of the Hair Care category was unchanged. • Skin and Personal Care net sales increased double digits due to favorable mix impacts driven by the disproportionate growth of the super premium SKII brand, increased pricing and favorable foreign exchange impacts, partially offset by a mid-single digit decrease in volumes. Organic sales increased high single digits. Volume decreased mid-teens in IMEA, decreased double digits in Europe and Asia Pacific and decreased mid-single digits in North America, all primarily due to pandemic-related skin care and deodorant category declines. This was partially offset by high single digits volume growth in Greater China driven by increased consumption of personal care products due to the pandemic. Global market share of the Skin and Personal Care category decreased more than half a point. Net earnings increased 32% to $577 million due to the increase in net sales and a 300 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. The net earnings margin increased due to a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales and an increase in gross margin. The gross margin increase was driven by the positive impacts of manufacturing cost savings and increased pricing, partially offset by increased commodity costs. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase. Nine months ended March 31, 2021 compared with nine months ended March 31, 2020 Beauty fiscal year to date net sales increased 7% to $10.9 billion on a 4% increase in unit volume. Higher pricing increased net sales by 2%. Favorable mix added 1% to net sales due to the disproportionate growth of the super premium SKII brand. Foreign exchange had no net impact to net sales. Organic sales increased 6%. Global market share of the Beauty segment decreased 0.7 points. • Hair Care net sales increased mid-single digits due to a mid-single digit increase in volumes and increased pricing, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Organic sales increased high single digits. The volume increase was driven by a mid-teens increase in Greater China (due to market growth, distribution growth and to a lesser extent the low base period due to pandemic-related shutdowns) and mid-single digits increases in North America, Latin America and IMEA (due to innovation and increased demand following pandemic-related shutdowns), partially offset by a mid-single digits decrease in Europe due to pandemic-related consumption declines. Global market share of the Hair Care category was unchanged. • Skin and Personal Care net sales increased high single digits due to a low single digit increase in volumes, favorable mix due to the disproportionate growth of the super premium SKII brand, increased pricing and favorable foreign exchange impacts. Organic sales increased mid-single digits. Volume grew double digits in Greater China and grew low single digits in North America driven by increased consumption of personal care products due to the pandemic, partially offset by double digits volume decrease in IMEA due to pandemic-related category declines. Global market share of the Skin and Personal Care category decreased less than a point. Net earnings increased 16% to $2.5 billion due to the increase in net sales and a 170 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. The net earnings margin increased due to a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales and an increase in gross margin. The gross margin increase was primarily driven by manufacturing cost savings and increased selling prices, partially offset by the negative impacts of unfavorable mix due to the disproportionate growth of hair care which has lower than segment-average gross margins. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase. Grooming Three months ended March 31, 2021 compared with three months ended March 31, 2020 Grooming net sales increased 4% to $1.4 billion during the third fiscal quarter on unit volume that was unchanged. Pricing had a positive 2% impact on net sales. Favorable mix had a positive 2% impact on net sales due to the disproportionate growth of Appliances category which has higher than segment-average selling prices. Foreign exchange had no net impact to net sales. Organic sales also increased 4%. Global market share of the Grooming segment decreased 0.3 points. • Shave Care net sales were unchanged as a low single digits volume decrease, unfavorable foreign exchange impacts and unfavorable mix impact (due to the disproportionate growth of IMEA which has lower than category-average selling prices), were offset by devaluation-related price increases. Organic sales were also unchanged. Volume decreased high single digits in Europe and Asia Pacific primarily due to pandemic-related consumption decline. This was partially offset by double digit volume growth in IMEA (due to innovation), high single digit growth in Greater China (due to market growth) and low single digit growth in North America (due to innovation and a lower base period due to pandemic-related distribution capacity limitations). Global market share of the Shave Care category was unchanged. • Appliances net sales increased more than 30% primarily due to a high teens volume increase, favorable foreign exchange impacts, increased pricing and favorable mix due to the disproportionate growth of premium products. Organic sales increased more than 20%. Volume increased more than 20% in Europe and increased mid-teens in North America due to innovation and increased consumption of at-home grooming and styling products driven by the pandemic. Global market share of the Appliances category increased more than 3 points. Net earnings increased 1% to $256 million due to the increase in net sales partially offset by a 60 basis-point decrease in net earnings margin. The net earnings margin decreased due to a reduction in gross margin, partially offset by a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. The gross margin reduction was driven by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts and the negative impact of unfavorable mix (due to the disproportionate growth of Appliances, which has lower than segment-average margins), partially offset by manufacturing cost savings and increased selling prices. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to a reduction in overhead costs, driven by productivity savings and the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase, partially offset by an increase in marketing spending. Nine months ended March 31, 2021 compared with nine months ended March 31, 2020 Grooming fiscal year to date net sales increased 5% to $4.8 billion on a 3% increase in unit volume. Foreign exchange had a negative 1% impact on net sales. Higher pricing increased net sales by 2%. Favorable mix had a 1% positive impact to net sales due to the disproportionate growth of the Appliances category, which has higher than segment-average selling prices. Organic sales also increased 5%. Global market share of the Grooming segment decreased 0.8 points. • Shave Care net sales decreased low single digits primarily due to unfavorable foreign exchange impacts and unfavorable mix (due to the disproportionate growth of lower priced products in IMEA and Latin America), partially offset by a low single digit increase in volume and devaluation-related price increases. Organic sales were unchanged. Volume increased mid-teens in IMEA, increased mid-single digits in Greater China and Latin America and increased low single digits in North America due to product innovation and increased distribution in certain markets. This was partially offset by mid-single digit decreases in Europe and Asia Pacific primarily due to pandemic-related consumption declines. Global market share of the Shave Care category was unchanged. • Appliances net sales increased more than 30% primarily due to a more than 20% increase in volume, favorable foreign exchange impacts, increased pricing and favorable mix due to the disproportionate growth of premium products. Organic sales increased around 30%. Volume increased in all regions led by a more than 30% increase in Europe and North America and a double digit increase in Asia Pacific due to innovation and increased consumption of at-home grooming and styling products driven by the pandemic. Global market share of the Appliances category increased more than two points. Net earnings increased 4% to $1.1 billion due primarily to the increase in net sales. Net earnings margin was unchanged for the period as a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was offset by a reduction in gross margin. Gross margin decreased due to unfavorable foreign exchange impacts and unfavorable mix impacts (due to the disproportionate growth of the IMEA region and the Appliances category, both of which have lower than segment-average margins), partially offset by manufacturing cost savings and increased selling prices. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased due to productivity savings and the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase, partially offset by a favorable legal settlement in the base period. Health Care Three months ended March 31, 2021 compared with three months ended March 31, 2020 Health Care net sales increased 4% to $2.4 billion during the third fiscal quarter on unit volume that was unchanged. Favorable mix increased net sales by 3% due to the disproportionate growth of premium power brush. Foreign exchange had a 1% positive impact on net sales. Pricing had no net impact to net sales. Organic sales increased 3%. Global market share of the Health Care segment increased 2 points. • Oral Care net sales increased double digits due to a low single digit increase in volume, favorable mix impacts due to the disproportionate growth of premium power brush and favorable foreign exchange impacts. Organic sales increased high single digits. The volume increase was driven by a more than 20% growth in IMEA (due to innovation), mid-teens growth in Greater China (due to innovation and a low base period volume due to pandemic-related lockdowns) and low single digits growth in North America (due to innovation and increased marketing spending). These volume increases were partially offset by a high single digits decline in Latin America (due to competitive activity and devaluation-related price increases) and a mid-single digits decline in Europe (due to pandemic-related lockdowns in the current period and higher base period volume due to pandemic-related pantry loading). Global market share of the Oral Care category increased more than half a point. • Personal Health Care net sales decreased mid-single digits versus the prior year period due primarily to a mid-single digit decrease in volume. Favorable geographic mix marginally improved net sales due to the disproportionate decline of certain markets in IMEA which have lower than category-average selling prices. Organic sales also decreased mid-single digits. The volume decrease was driven by a high single digits decline in Europe and mid-single digits declines in North America and IMEA primarily driven by a lower than average cough, cold and flu season in the current period and higher base period volume due to pandemic-related pantry loading, partially offset by a mid-teens volume increase in Asia Pacific due to innovation and increased marketing spending. Global market share of the Personal Health Care category increased more than a point. Net earnings decreased 8% to $377 million due to a 200 basis-point decrease in net earnings margin, partially offset by the increase in net sales. Net earnings margin decreased due to a decrease in gross margin and an increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. The decrease in gross margin was driven by unfavorable mix impacts (due to the disproportionate growth of the Oral care category, which has lower than segment-average margins and the decline in higher-margin respiratory products), and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, partially offset by manufacturing cost savings. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to an increase in marketing spending. Nine months ended March 31, 2021 compared with nine months ended March 31, 2020 Health Care fiscal year to date net sales increased 8% to $7.6 billion on a 4% increase in unit volume. Favorable mix increased net sales by 3% due to the disproportionate growth of the North America region and premium power brush and paste products, both of which have higher than segment-average selling prices. Increased pricing had a positive 1% impact to net sales. Foreign exchange had no net impact to net sales. Organic sales also increased 8%. Global market share of the Health Care segment increased 1.7 points. • Oral Care net sales increased double digits due to a mid-single digit increase in volume and favorable mix impacts from the disproportionate growth of premium power brush and paste products. Organic sales also increased double digits. The volume increase was driven by mid-teens growth in IMEA, double digit growth in Greater China, mid-single digit growth in North America and low single digits growth in Europe driven by innovation and increased marketing spending. Global market share of the Oral Care category increased a point. • Personal Health Care net sales increased low single digits versus the prior year period due to a low single digit increase in volume and increased pricing, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Organic sales also increased low single digits. The volume increase was driven by double digits growth in Asia Pacific, high single digits growth in Latin America, mid-single digits growth in North America and low single digits growth in IMEA, driven by innovation, increased consumption of certain health care products and increased marketing spending. Global market share of the Personal Health Care category increased more than a point. Net earnings increased 13% to $1.6 billion due to the increase in net sales and a 90 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin increased primarily due to a decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales and a gain on a minor brand divestiture in the current period, partially offset by a decrease in gross margin. The decrease in gross margin was driven by unfavorable mix impacts (due to the disproportionate growth of the Oral Care category, which has lower than segment-average margins and the decline of higher-margin respiratory products), and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, partially offset by manufacturing cost savings. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to the positive scale benefits of the net sales increase, productivity savings and a reduction in other operating expenses due to costs related to the Merck OTC consumer healthcare acquisition in the base period, partially offset by increased marketing spending. Fabric & Home Care Three months ended March 31, 2021 compared with three months ended March 31, 2020 Fabric & Home Care net sales increased 8% to $6.3 billion during the third fiscal quarter on a 3% increase in unit volume. Positive mix impacts increased net sales by 2% due to the disproportionate growth of the North America region and the Home Care category, which have higher than segment-average prices. Higher pricing increased net sales by 2%. Foreign exchange had a 1% positive impact to net sales. Organic sales increased 7%. Global market share of the Fabric & Home Care segment increased 0.7 points. • Fabric Care net sales increased mid-single digits due to a low single digit increase in volume, devaluation-related price increases, favorable foreign exchange impacts and positive mix impact due to the disproportionate growth of premium products and the North America region, both of which have higher than category-average selling prices. Organic sales increased low single digits. Increased volume was driven by more than 20% growth in Greater China (due to innovation and a lower base period due to pandemic-related lockdowns) and mid-single digits growth in North America (due to innovation and increased marketing spending), partially offset by a mid-single digits decline in Europe due to pandemic-related market contraction. Global market share of the Fabric Care category increased more than a point. • Home Care net sales increased high teens, primarily due to a double digit increase in volume, increased pricing, a positive mix impact due to the disproportionate growth of premium products and the North America region, both of which have higher than category-average selling prices and favorable foreign exchange impact. Organic sales also increased high teens. The volume increase was primarily driven by mid-teens growth in North America and high single digits growth in Europe due to consumption increases related to the COVID-19 pandemic, product innovation and increased marketing spending. Global market share of the Home Care category increased more than half a point. Net earnings increased 7% to $1.0 billion primarily due to the increase in net sales. Net earnings margin was unchanged as an increase in gross margin was offset by an increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales. The gross margin increase was driven by increased selling prices and manufacturing cost savings, partially offset by unfavorable mix impacts due to the disproportionate growth of products with lower than segment-average margins, unfavorable foreign exchange impacts and an increase in commodity costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to an increase in marketing spending, partially offset by the positive scale benefits of the net sales increase. Nine months ended March 31, 2021 compared with nine months ended March 31, 2020 Fabric & Home Care fiscal year to date net sales increased 11% to $19.4 billion on a 7% increase in unit volume. Positive mix impacts increased net sales by 3% due to the disproportionate growth of the North America region and the Home Care category, both of which have higher than segment-average prices. Higher pricing increased net sales by 1%. Foreign exchange had no net impact to net sales. Organic sales also increased 11%. Global market share of the Fabric & Home Care segment increased 0.9 points. • Fabric Care net sales increased high single digits due to a mid-single digit increase in volume, positive mix impact due to the disproportionate growth of premium products and the North America region and increased pricing. Organic sales increased mid-single digits. Increased volume was driven by double digit growth in North America and Greater China due to product innovation, incremental marketing spending and consumption increases related to the COVID-19 pandemic. These volume increases were partially offset by a low single digits decline in Europe and Asia Pacific due to market contraction and competitive activities. Global market share of the Fabric Care category increased more than a point. • Home Care net sales increased more than 20% primarily due to a volume increase of around 20%, positive mix impact due to the disproportionate growth of premium products and the North America region, both of which have higher than segment-average prices, and increased pricing. Organic sales also increased more than 20%. Volume increased in all regions led by more than 20% growth in North America, high teens growth in Latin America, mid-teens growth in Europe, and high single digits growth in Asia Pacific (all due to consumption increases related to the COVID-19 pandemic), product innovation and incremental marketing spending. Global market share of the Home Care category increased more than half a point. Net earnings increased 23% to $3.6 billion due to the increase in net sales and a 170 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. The net earnings margin increase was due to an increase in gross margin and a marginal decrease in SG&A as a percentage of sales. The gross margin increase was driven by manufacturing cost savings, increased selling prices and a reduction in commodity costs, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts and unfavorable mix due to the disproportionate growth of products with lower than segment-average margins. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to the positive scale benefits of the net sales increase, partially offset by an increase in marketing spending. Baby, Feminine & Family Care Three months ended March 31, 2021 compared with three months ended March 31, 2020 Baby, Feminine & Family Care net sales were unchanged at $4.6 billion during the third fiscal quarter on a 4% decrease in unit volume. Higher pricing increased net sales by 2%. Favorable mix had a 1% positive impact to net sales due to the disproportionate growth of premium products, including diaper pants and adult incontinence. Foreign exchange had a 1% positive impact to net sales. Organic sales decreased 1%. Global market share of the Baby, Feminine & Family Care segment decreased 0.6 points. • Net sales in Baby Care decreased mid-single digits due to a high single digit decrease in volume, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange impact and positive mix impact due to the relatively lower decline of the North America region and the growth of premium products. Organic sales also decreased mid-single digits. Volume decreased mid-teens in Asia Pacific (due to competitive activity and category contraction in certain markets), decreased double digits in Greater China (due to competitive activity) and Europe (due to reduction in retailer inventories, competitive activity in certain markets and higher base period volume due to pandemic-related pantry loading), and decreased mid-single digits in North America (primarily due to higher base period volume due to pandemic-related pantry loading). Global market share of the Baby Care category decreased nearly half a point. • Feminine Care net sales were unchanged as a mid-single digit volume decline was offset by a positive mix impact driven by the growth of the North America region and premium products and favorable foreign exchange impact. Organic sales decreased low single digits. Volume decreased high-teens in Europe (due to pandemic-related market declines in the current period and higher base period volume due to pandemic-related pantry loading) and decreased mid-single digits in Latin America (due to pandemic-related consumption declines and competitive activity). This was partially offset by a mid-single digits volume increase in Greater China and a low single digits increase in North America and IMEA, primarily due to innovation. Global market share of the Feminine Care category increased more than half a point. • Net sales in Family Care, which is predominantly a North American business, increased mid-single digits primarily due to increased pricing (driven by lower consumer promotions). Volume was unchanged. Organic sales also increased mid-single digits. North America share of the Family Care category decreased more than two points. Net earnings increased 1% to $871 million primarily due to a 20 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin increased primarily due to an increase in gross margin, offset by an increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin increased primarily due to higher selling prices, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts and an increase in commodity costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to an increase in overhead costs. Nine months ended March 31, 2021 compared with nine months ended March 31, 2020 Baby, Feminine & Family Care fiscal year to date net sales increased 3% to $14.2 billion on a 1% increase in unit volume. Higher pricing increased net sales by 1%. Favorable mix impact increased net sales by 1% due to the disproportionate growth of the North America region. Foreign exchange had no net impact to net sales. Organic sales also increased 3%. Global market share of the Baby, Feminine & Family Care segment decreased 0.4 points. • Net sales in Baby Care decreased low single digits due to a mid-single digit decrease in volume, partially offset by devaluation-related price increases and positive mix impact due to the growth of the North America region and premium products. Organic sales also decreased low single digits. Volume decreased double digits in Greater China (due to competitive activity and consumer pantry destocking), decreased high single digits in Latin America (due to market contraction), IMEA (due to pandemic-related retailer inventory reductions and market contraction), and Asia Pacific (due primarily to market contractions and competitive activity) and decreased mid-single digits in Europe (due to market contractions and competitive activity in certain markets). These volume decreases were partially offset by low single digits volume growth in North America due to consumption increase in certain products and innovation. Global market share of the Baby Care category decreased more than half a point. • Feminine Care net sales increased mid-single digits due to increased pricing and positive mix impact of the growth of the North America region and premium products. This was partially offset by a low single digit decrease in global volume. Organic sales also increased mid-single digits. Volume decreased high single digits in Europe (due to pandemic-related consumption declines) and decreased mid-single digits in Latin America (due to competitive activity and pandemic-related consumption declines). Volume increased mid-single digits in North America (due to innovation) and in IMEA (primarily due to market growth and innovation). Global market share of the Feminine Care category increased less than a point. • Net sales in Family Care, which is predominantly a North American business, increased double digits driven by a high single digit increase in volumes and increased pricing driven by lower consumer promotions, partially offset by unfavorable mix impact due to the disproportionate growth of larger pack sizes. Organic sales also increased double digits. The volume increase was driven by a pandemic-related consumption increase and pantry loading, and to a lesser extent, retailer inventory restocking. North America share of the Family Care category decreased more than a point. Net earnings increased 15% to $2.9 billion due to the increase in net sales and a 200 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin increased primarily due to an increase in gross margin, and to a lesser extent, a decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin increased due to manufacturing cost savings, increased selling prices and a reduction in commodity costs, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to the positive scale benefits of the net sales increase. Corporate Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business segments. These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level; financing and investing activities; certain employee benefit costs; other general corporate items; the gains and losses related to certain divested brands and categories; and certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the reportable segments to U.S. GAAP. The most significant reconciling item relates to income taxes, to adjust from blended statutory rates that are reflected in the reportable segments to the overall Company effective tax rate. Corporate net sales improved by $4 million to $120 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2021 and increased $10 million to $316 million for the fiscal year to date. Corporate net earnings improved by $98 million in the quarter due to lower restructuring charges versus the base period and the current period unrealized gain on an equity investment that became publicly traded in the quarter, partially offset by a higher current period tax rate all of which have been described above. Corporate net earnings decreased $473 million for the fiscal year to date period, primarily due to the $427 million ($512 million before tax) current period charge for early debt extinguishment, higher interest expense, lower interest income, and the higher current year tax rate, partially offset by lower restructuring charges versus the base period and the current period unrealized gain from an equity investment, all of which have been described above. Restructuring Program to deliver Productivity and Cost Savings In 2012, the Company initiated a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs and better leverage scale in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overheads. The plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes to fund the Company's growth strategy. In 2017, the Company communicated specific elements of an additional multi-year productivity and cost savings program. As part of this plan, which was largely completed by the end of fiscal 2020, the Company incurred $1.5 billion in total before-tax restructuring costs across fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2021 and onwards, the Company expects to incur restructuring costs within the range of our historical ongoing level of $250 to $500 million before tax. In addition to our restructuring programs, we have additional ongoing savings efforts in our supply chain, marketing and overhead areas that have and are expected to continue to yield additional benefits to our operating margins. Refer to Note 9 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the restructuring program. LIQUIDITY & CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating Activities We generated $14.3 billion of cash from operating activities fiscal year to date, an increase of $1.7 billion versus the prior year period. Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, loss on extinguishment of debt, share-based compensation expense, deferred income taxes and gain on sale of assets), generated $14.2 billion of operating cash flow. Working capital and other impacts generated $53 million of cash in the period. Accounts receivable increased, using $604 million of cash, primarily due to sales growth. Days sales outstanding also increased about two days driven by higher relative amount of sales towards the end of the quarter. Inventory increased, consuming $399 million of cash primarily due to business growth, increased safety stock levels during the COVID-19 pandemic and commodity cost increases. Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities increased, generating $1.0 billion of cash. About half of this increase was driven by extended payment terms to suppliers. The remaining increase is due to higher marketing spending and to support the increase in inventory. These increases were partially offset by the payment of prior fiscal year-end incentive compensation and other salary-related accruals. Investing Activities Investing activities used $2.0 billion of cash fiscal year to date primarily due to capital expenditures. Financing Activities Financing activities used $18.4 billion of cash fiscal year to date. We used $8.0 billion for treasury stock purchases and $6.1 billion for dividends. We used $5.8 billion for net debt reductions, including $512 million for early debt extinguishment costs related to the early retirement of $2.3 billion of debt. The exercise of stock options and other financing activities generated $1.5 billion of cash. As of March 31, 2021, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $9.4 billion. We have short- and long-term debt to meet our financing needs. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements. RECONCILIATION OF MEASURES NOT DEFINED BY U.S. GAAP In accordance with the SEC's Regulation S-K Item 10(e), the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measures. We believe that these measures provide useful perspective on underlying business results and trends (i.e., trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and provide a supplemental measure of year-on-year results. The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measures, but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted. Organic sales growth: Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. This measure is used in assessing achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. Adjusted free cash flow: Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the U.S. Tax Act (the company incurred a transitional tax liability of approximately $3.8 billion in fiscal 2018 from the U.S. Tax Act of 2017 which is payable over a period of 8 years). Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. Management views adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments. Adjusted free cash flow productivity: Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the charges for early debt extinguishment (which are not considered part of our ongoing operations). Management views adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G’s ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. This measure is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. The Company's long-term target is to generate annual adjusted free cash flow productivity at or above 90 percent. Core EPS: Core earnings per share, or Core EPS, is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share adjusted as indicated. Management views this non-GAAP measure as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time. This measure is also used when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation. The Core earnings measures included in the following reconciliation tables refer to the equivalent GAAP measures adjusted as applicable for the following items: Incremental Restructuring: The Company has historically had an ongoing level of restructuring activities. Such activities have resulted in ongoing annual restructuring-related charges of approximately $250 - $500 million before tax. Beginning in 2012, the Company has had a strategic productivity and cost savings initiative that resulted in incremental restructuring charges. The adjustment to Core earnings includes only the restructuring costs above what we believe are the normal recurring level of restructuring costs. In fiscal 2021 and onwards, the Company expects to incur restructuring costs within our historical ongoing level noted above. Early debt extinguishment charges: In the three months ended December 31, 2020, the Company recorded after tax charges of $427 million ($512 million before tax), due to early extinguishment of certain long-term debt. These charges represent the difference between the reacquisition price and the par value of the debt extinguished. We do not view the above items to be part of our sustainable results and their exclusion from Core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-over-year results. These items are also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation.

See accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Basis of Presentation These statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of The Procter & Gamble Company and subsidiaries (the ""Company,"" ""Procter & Gamble,"" ""P&G,"" ""we"" or ""our"") contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods reported. However, the results of operations included in such financial statements may not necessarily be indicative of annual results. 2. New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies On July 1, 2020, we adopted ASU 2017-04, ""Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment."" The standard simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by requiring a goodwill impairment to be measured using a single step impairment model, whereby the impairment equals the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the specified reporting units in their entirety. This eliminated the second step of the previous impairment model that required companies to first estimate the fair value of all assets in a reporting unit and measure impairments based on those estimated fair values and a residual measurement approach. It also specifies that any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The impact of the new standard will depend on the specific facts and circumstances of future individual impairments, if any. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, ""Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting."" The amendments provide optional guidance for a limited time to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform. The new guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met and to other derivative instruments if there is a change to the interest rates used for discounting, margining or contract price alignment. These amendments are effective immediately and may be applied prospectively to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated on or before December 31, 2022. We are currently evaluating our contracts and the optional expedients provided by the new standard. No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had, or is expected to have, a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 3. Segment Information Under U.S. GAAP, our operating segments are aggregated into five reportable segments: 1) Beauty, 2) Grooming, 3) Health Care, 4) Fabric & Home Care and 5) Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Our five reportable segments are comprised of: • Beauty : Hair Care (Conditioners, Shampoos, Styling Aids, Treatments); Skin and Personal Care (Antiperspirants and Deodorants, Personal Cleansing, Skin Care); • Grooming : Shave Care (Female Blades & Razors, Male Blades & Razors, Pre- and Post-Shave Products, Other Shave Care); Appliances • Health Care : Oral Care (Toothbrushes, Toothpaste, Other Oral Care); Personal Health Care (Gastrointestinal, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements, Pain Relief, Other Personal Health Care); • Fabric & Home Care : Fabric Care (Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Additives, Laundry Detergents); Home Care (Air Care, Dish Care, P&G Professional, Surface Care); and • Baby, Feminine & Family Care : Baby Care (Baby Wipes, Taped Diapers and Pants); Feminine Care (Adult Incontinence, Feminine Care); Family Care (Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper).

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill is allocated by reportable segment as follows: Beauty Grooming Health Care Fabric & Home Care Baby, Feminine & Family Care Total Company Goodwill at June 30, 2020 $ 12,902 $ 12,815 $ 7,786 $ 1,841 $ 4,557 $ 39,901 Translation and other 542 398 344 45 151 1,480 Goodwill at December 31, 2020 $ 13,444 $ 13,213 $ 8,130 $ 1,886 $ 4,708 $ 41,381 Goodwill increased from June 30, 2020 due to currency translation. Identifiable intangible assets at December 31, 2020 were comprised of: Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Intangible assets with determinable lives $ 8,679 $ ( 5,977 ) Intangible assets with indefinite lives 21,162 — Total identifiable intangible assets $ 29,841 $ ( 5,977 ) Intangible assets with determinable lives consist of brands, patents, technology and customer relationships. The intangible assets with indefinite lives consist of brands. The amortization expense of determinable-lived intangible assets for the three months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $ 79 and $ 91 , respectively. For the six months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the amortization expense was $ 163 and $ 187 , respectively. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment by comparing the estimated fair values of our reporting units and underlying indefinite-lived intangible assets to their respective carrying values. We typically use an income method to estimate fair value of these assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. If the resulting fair value is less than its carrying value, that difference represents an impairment. Our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets occurs during the three months ended December 31. The business unit valuations used to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment depend on a number of significant estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment, margin expansion and Company business plans. We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable. However, future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount rates, tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. To the extent changes in such factors result in a failure to achieve the level of projected cash flows initially used to estimate fair value for purposes of establishing or subsequently impairing the carrying amount of goodwill and related intangible assets, we may need to record non-cash impairment charges in the future. Most of our goodwill reporting units are comprised of a combination of legacy and acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that, at a minimum, exceed two times their underlying carrying values. Certain of our goodwill reporting units, in particular Shave Care and Appliances, are comprised entirely of acquired businesses and as a result, have fair value cushions that are not as high. The Appliances reporting unit has a fair value that significantly exceeds the underlying carrying value. As previously disclosed, the carrying value of the Shave Care reporting unit and the related Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset were impaired during the quarter ended June 30, 2019. Also as previously disclosed, the Shave Care reporting unit fair value exceeded its carrying value by more than 20 % and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset fair value approximated its carrying value as of our fiscal 2020 impairment testing dates. Accordingly, no impairment charge was recorded during the year ended June 30, 2020. Based on our impairment testing during the three months ended December 31, 2020, the Shave Care reporting unit fair value continued to exceed its carrying value by more than 20 % and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset fair value continued to approximate its carrying value. The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the net sales and earnings growth rates (including residual growth rates) and the discount rate. The residual growth rate represents the expected rate at which the Shave Care reporting unit and Gillette brand are expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period. The residual growth rate utilized in our fair value estimates is consistent with the reporting unit and brand operating plans and approximates expected long term category market growth rates. The residual growth rate depends on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, relative currency exchange rates and business activities that impact market share. As a result, the residual growth rate could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes, devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or an increased competitive environment. The discount rate, which is consistent with a weighted average cost of Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, such as further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar. Spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the U.S. While management can and has implemented strategies to address these events, changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that would trigger future impairment charges of the Shave Care reporting unit's goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. The duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic could also result in additional future impairment charges for the Shave Care reporting unit goodwill and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset. While we have concluded that no impairment exists based on our testing during the quarter ended December 31, 2020, the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is most susceptible to future impairment risk. Our assessment of the Gillette intangible asset assumes the pandemic’s impact on net sales will begin to abate during the second half of the fiscal year. There continues to be a high level of uncertainty relating to how the pandemic will evolve, how governments and consumers will react and progress on the approval and distribution of vaccines. Accordingly, there is a significant amount of risk related to this key assumption. A more prolonged pandemic could impact the assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset that are significant enough to trigger an impairment. Net sales and earnings growth rates could be negatively impacted by reductions or changes in demand for our shave care products, which may be caused by, among other things: the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine or other travel restrictions, or financial hardship, or by shifts in demand away from one or more of our higher priced products to lower priced products. In addition, relative global and country/regional macroeconomic factors could result in additional and prolonged devaluation of other countries’ currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Finally, the discount rate utilized in our valuation model could be impacted by changes in the underlying interest rates and risk premiums included in the determination of the cost of capital. As of December 31, 2020, the carrying values of the Shave Care goodwill and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset were $ 12.9 billion and $ 14.1 billion, respectively. The table below provides a sensitivity analysis for the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset, utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the shorter-term and residual growth rates and the discount rate, to demonstrate the potential impacts to the estimated fair values. The table below provides, in isolation, the estimated fair value impacts related to a 25 basis-point increase in the discount rate or a 25 basis-point decrease in our shorter-term and residual growth rates, either of which, in isolation, would result in an additional impairment of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset.

Earnings Per Share Basic net earnings per common share are calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble less preferred dividends (net of related tax benefits) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net earnings per common share are calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble by the diluted weighted average number of common shares during the period. The diluted shares include the dilutive effect of stock options and other stock-based awards based on the treasury stock method and the assumed conversion of preferred stock. Net earnings per share were calculated as follows: CONSOLIDATED AMOUNTS Three Months Ended December 31 Six Months Ended December 31 2020 2019 2020 2019 Net earnings $ 3,887 $ 3,743 $ 8,195 $ 7,360 Less: Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 33 26 64 50 Net earnings attributable to P&G (Diluted) 3,854 3,717 8,131 7,310 Less: Preferred dividends, net of tax 66 64 132 129 Net earnings attributable to P&G available to common shareholders (Basic) $ 3,788 $ 3,653 $ 7,999 $ 7,181 SHARES IN MILLIONS Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 2,475.8 2,487.0 2,481.0 2,495.5 Add: Effect of dilutive securities Conversion of preferred shares (1) 83.1 86.4 83.5 86.9 Impact of stock options and other unvested equity awards (2) 56.5 56.7 55.9 56.4 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 2,615.4 2,630.1 2,620.4 2,638.8 NET EARNINGS PER SHARE (3) Basic $ 1.53 $ 1.47 $ 3.22 $ 2.88 Diluted $ 1.47 $ 1.41 $ 3.10 $ 2.77 (1) Despite being included currently in Diluted net earnings per common share, the actual conversion to common stock occurs when the preferred shares are sold. Shares may only be sold after being allocated to the ESOP participants pursuant to the repayment of the ESOP's obligations through 2035. (2) Weighted average outstanding stock options of approximately 8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020, and approximately 6 million and 2 million for the six months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were not included in the Diluted net earnings per share calculation because the options were out of the money or to do so would have been antidilutive (i.e., the total proceeds upon exercise would have exceeded the market value of the underlying common shares). There were no antidilutive shares for the three months ended December 31, 2019. (3) Net earnings per share are calculated on Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble. 6. Share-Based Compensation and Postretirement Benefits The following table provides a summary of our share-based compensation expense and postretirement benefit costs: Three Months Ended December 31 Six Months Ended December 31 2020 2019 2020 2019 Share-based compensation expense $ 165 $ 92 $ 254 $ 202 Net periodic benefit cost for pension benefits (1) 46 44 93 84 Net periodic benefit credit for other retiree benefits (1) ( 80 ) ( 52 ) ( 160 ) ( 104 ) (1) The components of the total net periodic benefit cost/(credit) for both pension benefits and other retiree benefits for these interim periods, on an annualized basis, do not differ materially from the amounts disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. 7. Risk Management Activities and Fair Value Measurements As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. There have been no significant changes in our risk management policies or activities during the six months ended December 31, 2020. The Company has not changed its valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period. The Company recognizes transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of each quarter. There were no transfers between levels during the periods presented. Also, there was no significant activity within the Level 3 assets and liabilities during the periods presented. There were no significant assets or liabilities that were remeasured at fair value on a non-recurring basis for the six months ended December 31, 2020. Cash equivalents were $ 10.4 billion and $ 14.6 billion as of December 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020, respectively, and are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. Other investments had a fair value of $ 70 and $ 67 as of December 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020, respectively, and are presented in Other noncurrent assets. These investments measured at fair value are generally classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. There are no material investment balances classified as Level 1 or Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy or using net asset value as a practical expedient. Fair values are generally estimated based upon quoted market prices for similar instruments. The fair value of long-term debt was $ 28.5 billion and $ 29.0 billion as of December 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020, respectively. This includes the current portion of long-term debt instruments ($ 3.3 billion and $ 2.5 billion as of December 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020, respectively). Certain long-term debt (debt designated as a fair value hedge) is recorded at fair value. All other long-term debt is recorded at amortized cost but is measured at fair value for disclosure purposes. We consider our debt to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Fair values are generally estimated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments. Disclosures about Financial Instruments The notional amounts and fair values of financial instruments used in hedging transactions as of December 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020 are as follows: Notional Amount Fair Value Asset Fair Value (Liability) December 31, 2020 June 30, 2020 December 31, 2020 June 30, 2020 December 31, 2020 June 30, 2020 DERIVATIVES IN FAIR VALUE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Interest rate contracts $ 7,591 $ 7,114 $ 274 $ 269 $ — $ — DERIVATIVES IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Foreign currency interest rate contracts $ 7,393 $ 3,856 $ — $ 26 $ ( 459 ) $ ( 41 ) TOTAL DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS $ 14,984 $ 10,970 $ 274 $ 295 $ ( 459 ) $ ( 41 ) DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS Foreign currency contracts $ 8,120 $ 5,986 $ 100 $ 23 $ ( 29 ) $ ( 25 ) TOTAL DERIVATIVES AT FAIR VALUE $ 23,104 $ 16,956 $ 374 $ 318 $ ( 488 ) $ ( 66 ) The fair value of the interest rate derivative asset/(liability) directly offsets the cumulative amount of the fair value hedging adjustment included in the carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation. The carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation, which includes the unamortized discount or premium and the fair value adjustment, was $ 7.8 billion and $ 7.4 billion as of December 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020, respectively. In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges. The carrying value of those debt instruments designated as net investment hedges, which includes the adjustment for the foreign currency transaction gain or loss on those instruments, was $ 12.4 billion and $ 16.0 billion as of December 31, 2020 and June 30, 2020, respectively. The increase in the notional balance of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges is largely offset by the decrease in the principal balance of debt instruments designated as net investment hedges, reflecting the Company’s decision to leverage favorable interest rates in the foreign currency swap market versus the short-term debt market. The increase in the notional balance of foreign currency contracts not designated as hedging instruments reflects changes in the level of intercompany financing activity during the period. All derivative assets are presented in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Other noncurrent assets. All derivative liabilities are presented in Accrued and other liabilities or Other noncurrent liabilities. Changes in the fair value of net Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. investment hedges are recognized in the Foreign currency translation component of Other comprehensive income (OCI). All of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Before tax gains/(losses) on our financial instruments in hedging relationships are categorized as follows: Amount of Gain/(Loss) Recognized in OCI on Derivatives Three Months Ended December 31 Six Months Ended December 31 2020 2019 2020 2019 DERIVATIVES IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS (1) (2) Foreign exchange contracts $ ( 352 ) $ ( 82 ) $ ( 538 ) $ 31 (1) For the derivatives in net investment hedging relationships, the amount of gain excluded from effectiveness testing, which was recognized in earnings, was $ 16 and $ 21 for the three months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The amount of gain excluded from effectiveness testing was $ 30 and $ 40 for the six months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. (2) In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges. The amount of loss recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (AOCI) for such instruments was $( 595 ) and $( 428 ) for the three months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The amount of gain/(loss) recognized in AOCI for such instruments was $( 1,241 ) and $ 181 for the six months ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

These are both recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in Interest expense. The gain/(loss) on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is substantially offset by the currency mark-to-market of the related exposure. These are both recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A). 8. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss) The table below presents the changes in AOCI, including the reclassifications out of AOCI by component: Investment Securities Post-retirement Benefits Foreign Currency Translation Total AOCI Balance at June 30, 2020 $ ( 1 ) $ ( 4,350 ) $ ( 11,814 ) $ ( 16,165 ) OCI before reclassifications (1) 14 ( 334 ) 1,237 917 Amounts reclassified from AOCI into the Consolidated Statements of Earnings (2) — 164 — 164 Net current period OCI 14 ( 170 ) 1,237 1,081 Less: Other comprehensive income attributable to non-controlling interests — — 7 7 Balance at December 31, 2020 $ 13 $ ( 4,520 ) $ ( 10,584 ) $ ( 15,091 ) (1) Net of tax expense/(benefit) of $ 0 , $( 107 ) and $( 418 ) for gains/losses on investment securities, postretirement benefit items and foreign currency translation, respectively.

The below provides additional details on amounts reclassified from AOCI into the Consolidated Statements of Earnings: • Postretirement benefits: amounts reclassified from AOCI into Other non-operating income, net and included in the computation of net periodic postretirement costs. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. 9. Restructuring Program The Company has historically incurred an ongoing annual level of restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Before-tax costs incurred under the ongoing program have generally ranged from $ 250 to $ 500 annually. In fiscal 2017, the Company announced specific elements of an additional multi-year productivity and cost savings plan to further reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, certain marketing activities and overhead expenses, which resulted in incremental restructuring charges through fiscal 2020. We expect fiscal 2021 restructuring charges to be more in line with our ongoing level of spending noted above. Restructuring costs incurred consist primarily of costs to separate employees, asset-related costs to exit facilities and other costs. Employee separation costs relate to severance packages that were primarily voluntary and the amounts were calculated based on salary levels and past service periods. Severance costs related to voluntary separations are generally charged to earnings when the employee accepts the offer. Asset-related costs consist of both asset write-downs and accelerated depreciation. Asset write-downs relate to the establishment of a new fair value basis for assets held-for-sale or disposal. These assets were written down to the lower of their current carrying basis or amounts expected to be realized upon disposal, less minor disposal costs. Charges for accelerated depreciation relate to long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period. These assets relate primarily to manufacturing consolidations and technology standardizations. The asset-related charges will not have a significant impact on future depreciation charges. Other restructuring-type charges are incurred as a direct result of the restructuring program. Such charges primarily include asset removal and termination of contracts related to supply chain optimization. The following table presents restructuring activity for the three and six months ended December 31, 2020. The majority of the remaining reserve balance as of December 31, 2020 related to employee separations. Reserve Balance Previously Reported (Three Months Ended September 30, 2020) Three Months Ended December 31, 2020 Six Months Ended December 31, 2020 Reserve Balance June 30, 2020 Cost Incurred and Charged to Expense Cost Incurred and Charged to Expense Cost Paid/Settled December 31, 2020 Total $ 472 $ 22 $ 65 $ ( 277 ) $ 282 10. Commitments and Contingencies Litigation We are subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental, patent and trademark matters, labor and employment matters and tax. While considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management and our counsel, the ultimate resolution of the various lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior manufacturing and waste disposal practices. Based on currently available information, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of environmental remediation will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Income Tax Uncertainties The Company is present in approximately 70 countries and over 150 taxable jurisdictions and, at any point in time, has 40 – 50 jurisdictional audits underway at various stages of completion. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite our belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitations. Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate. We have tax years open ranging from 2008 and forward. We are generally not able to reliably estimate the ultimate settlement amounts until the close of the audit. Based on information currently available, we anticipate that over the next 12 month period, audit activity could be completed related to uncertain tax positions in multiple jurisdictions for which we have accrued existing liabilities of approximately $ 60 , including interest and penalties. Additional information on the Commitments and Contingencies of the Company can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended June 30, 2020. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. Item 2.

A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected herein, is included in the section titled ""Economic Conditions and Uncertainties"" and the section titled ""Risk Factors"" (Part II, Item 1A) of this Form 10-Q. The purpose of Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is to provide an understanding of Procter & Gamble's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. The MD&A is organized in the following sections: • Overview • Summary of Results – Six Months Ended December 31, 2020 • Economic Conditions and Uncertainties • Results of Operations – Three and Six Months Ended December 31, 2020 • Business Segment Discussion – Three and Six Months Ended December 31, 2020 • Liquidity and Capital Resources • Reconciliation of Measures Not Defined by U.S. GAAP Throughout the MD&A, we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales and net earnings. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), consisting of organic sales growth, core net earnings per share (Core EPS), adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity. The explanation at the end of the MD&A provides the definition of these non-GAAP measures, details on the use and the derivation of these measures, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures. Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and market consumption in the MD&A are based on a combination of vendor purchased traditional brick-and-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales of our products in dollar terms on a constant currency basis, relative to all product sales in the category. The Company measures fiscal year to date market shares through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months as compared to the end of the reporting period. Management also uses unit volume growth to evaluate and explain drivers of changes in net sales. Organic volume growth reflects year-over-year changes in unit volume excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and certain one-time items if applicable and is used to explain changes in organic sales. OVERVIEW P&G is a global leader in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world.

The following table provides the percentage of net sales and net earnings by reportable business segment for the three and six months ended December 31, 2020 (excluding net sales and net earnings in Corporate): Three Months Ended December 31, 2020 Six Months Ended December 21, 2020 Net Sales Net Earnings Net Sales Net Earnings Beauty 19% 22% 19% 23% Grooming 9% 10% 9% 9% Health Care 14% 15% 13% 14% Fabric & Home Care 33% 29% 34% 30% Baby, Feminine & Family Care 25% 24% 25% 24% Total Company 100% 100% 100% 100% SUMMARY OF RESULTS Following are highlights of results for the six months ended December 31, 2020 versus the six months ended December 31, 2019: • Net sales increased 8% to $39.1 billion, driven by double digit increases in Fabric & Home Care and Health Care and mid-single digits increases in Beauty, Grooming and Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, increased 9%. Organic sales also increased double digits in Fabric & Home Care and Health Care and increased mid-single digits in Beauty, Grooming and Baby, Feminine & Family Care. • Net earnings were $8.2 billion, an increase of $835 million or 11% versus the prior year period due to the increase in net sales and an increase in operating margins, partially offset by an increase in the income tax rate and $512 million of current year charges for early debt extinguishment. • Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $821 million or 11% versus the prior year period to $8.1 billion. • Diluted net earnings per share (EPS) increased 12% to $3.10 due primarily to the increase in net earnings. • Core net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble, which represents net earnings excluding charges for the early extinguishment of debt in the current period and incremental restructuring charges in the base period, increased 16% to $8.6 billion. Core net earnings per share increased 17% to $3.27 versus the prior year due primarily to the increase in Core net earnings. • Operating cash flow was $10.2 billion. Adjusted free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less capital expenditures and certain other impacts, was $9.0 billion. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 104%. ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES Global Economic Conditions . Our products are sold in numerous countries across North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa with more than half our sales generated outside the United States. As such, we are exposed to and impacted by global macro-economic factors, U.S. and foreign government policies and foreign exchange fluctuations. Current global economic conditions are highly volatile due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in both market size contractions in certain countries due to economic slowdowns and government restrictions on movement, as well as market size increases in certain countries due to pantry loading and increased consumption of household cleaning and personal health and hygiene products by consumers. Other macro-economic factors also remain dynamic, and any causes of market size contraction, such as reduced GDP in commodity-dependent economies, greater political unrest or instability in the Middle East, Central & Eastern Europe, certain Latin American markets, the Hong Kong market in Greater China and the Korean peninsula could reduce our net sales or erode our operating margin, in either case reducing our net earnings and cash flows. Changes in Costs. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, transportation costs and our own productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities, in particular, certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp, and volatility in the market price of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs. Disruptions in our manufacturing, supply and distribution operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic may also impact our costs. If we are unable to manage these impacts through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions, as well as through consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. Net sales could also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on consumption of our products. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including outsourcing projects, supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. In fiscal 2017, we communicated specific elements of a multi-year cost reduction program which is resulting in targeted enrollment reductions and other savings. If we are not successful in executing and sustaining these changes, there could be a negative impact on our gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. Foreign Exchange . We have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates. Translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation of transaction-related working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. In the past two fiscal years, as well as the current fiscal year, the U.S. dollar has strengthened versus a number of foreign currencies, leading to lower sales and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts. Certain countries experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations, like Argentina, Brazil, Russia, Turkey, the United Kingdom, China as well as the European Union have previously had, and could in the future have, a significant impact on our net sales, costs and net earnings. Increased pricing in response to certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could also have a negative impact on consumption of our products, which would affect our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. Government Policies . Our net earnings and cash flows could be materially affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government legislative, regulatory or enforcement policies, for example, any tax regulatory guidance issued as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017 (the U.S. Tax Act) or any significant change in global tax policy adopted under the current work being led by the OECD for the G20 focused on ""Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy."" The breadth of the OECD project extends beyond pure digital businesses and is likely to impact all multinational businesses by redefining jurisdictional taxation rights. Further, our net sales, net earnings and cash flows may be impacted by U.S. and foreign government policies to manage the COVID-19 pandemic, such as movement restrictions or site closures. Additionally, we attempt to carefully manage our debt, currency and other exposures in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and pricing controls, such as Nigeria, Algeria, Egypt, Argentina and Turkey. Further, our net sales, net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes to international trade agreements in North America and elsewhere, including increases of import tariffs, both currently effective and future potential changes. Changes in government policies in these areas might cause an increase or decrease in our net sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. COVID-19 Pandemic Disclosures The Company’s priorities during the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be protecting the health and safety of our employees; maximizing the availability of products that help consumers with their health, hygiene and cleaning needs; and using our employees’ talents and our resources to help society meet and overcome the current challenges. Because the Company sells products that are essential to the daily lives of consumers, the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a materially negative impact to our consolidated net sales, net earnings and cash flows. The pandemic has had both positive and negative impacts to our net sales and net earnings during the three and six month periods ended December 31, 2020. We have experienced a significant increase in demand and consumption of certain of our product categories (fabric, home cleaning and hygiene products) primarily in North America and Europe, caused in part by changing consumer habits, pantry stocking and retailer inventory replenishment, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, contributing to increases in net sales, net earnings and cash flows. At the same time, we experienced a decrease in net sales due to the economic slowdown and restricted consumer movements in certain regions, including IMEA (India, Middle East and Africa) and Asia Pacific, in certain channels, including travel retail and professional, and in certain of our beauty and grooming products. In the future, the pandemic may cause reduced demand for our products if it results in a recessionary global economic environment. Demand in certain countries in Latin America, Asia Pacific, and IMEA may be particularly susceptible to recession. It could also lead to volatility in consumer access to our products due to government actions impacting our ability to produce and ship products or impacting consumers’ movements and access to our products. We believe that over the long term, there will continue to be strong demand for categories in which we operate, particularly our products that deliver essential health, hygiene and cleaning benefits. However, the timing and extent of demand recovery in certain markets in Asia Pacific, IMEA and Latin America, the resumption of international travel, the timing and impact of potential consumer pantry destocking in markets including North America and Europe, and product demand volatility caused by future economic trends are unclear. Accordingly, there may be heightened volatility in net sales, net earnings and cash flows during and subsequent to the duration of the pandemic. Our retail customers are also being impacted by the pandemic. Their success in addressing the issues and maintaining their operations could impact consumer access to, and as a result, sales of our products. Our ability to continue to operate without any significant negative impacts will in part depend on our ability to protect our employees and our supply chain. The Company has endeavored to follow actions recommended by governments and health authorities to protect our employees world-wide, with particular measures in place for those working in our plants and distribution facilities. We have also worked closely with local and national officials to keep our manufacturing facilities open due to the essential nature of the majority of our products. While we have been able to broadly maintain our operations, we experienced some disruption in our supply chain in certain markets in Asia Pacific and IMEA in the first months of the pandemic due primarily to the restriction of employee movements as well as increased transportation and manufacturing costs. We intend to continue to work with government authorities and implement our employee safety measures to ensure that we continue manufacturing and distributing our products during the pandemic. However, uncertainty resulting from the pandemic could result in an unforeseen disruption to our supply chain (for example, a closure of a key manufacturing or distribution facility or the inability of a key material or transportation supplier to source and transport materials) that could impact our operations. Because the pandemic has not had a material negative impact on our operations or demand for our products and resulting net sales and net earnings, it has also not negatively impacted the Company’s liquidity position. We continue to generate operating cash flows to meet our short-term liquidity needs, and we have maintained access to the capital markets enabled by our strong short- and long-term credit ratings. We have also not observed any material impairments of our assets or a significant change in the fair value of assets due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For additional information on risk factors that could impact our results, please refer to “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of the Company's Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Three Months Ended December 31, 2020 The following discussion provides a review of results for the three months ended December 31, 2020 versus the three months ended December 31, 2019. Three Months Ended December 31 Amounts in millions, except per share amounts 2020 2019 % Chg Net sales $19,745 $18,240 8% Operating income 5,380 4,482 20% Net earnings 3,887 3,743 4% Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 3,854 3,717 4% Diluted net earnings per common share 1.47 1.41 4% Core net earnings per common share 1.64 1.42 15% Three Months Ended December 31 COMPARISONS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES 2020 2019 Basis Pt Chg Gross margin 53.1% 51.4% 170 Selling, general & administrative expense 25.9% 26.8% (90) Operating income 27.2% 24.6% 260 Earnings before income taxes 24.7% 24.8% (10) Net earnings 19.7% 20.5% (80) Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 19.5% 20.4% (90) Net Sales Net sales for the quarter increased 8% to $19.7 billion on a 5% increase in unit volume. Increased pricing had a 1% positive impact to net sales. Mix had a 2% positive impact to net sales, driven by the disproportionate growth of the North America region and the Home Care and Appliances businesses, all of which have higher than company-average selling prices. Foreign exchange had no net impact on net sales. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, organic sales also increased 8% on a 5% increase in organic volume. Net sales increased double digits in Fabric & Home Care, increased high single digits in Health Care and increased mid-single digits in Beauty, in Baby, Feminine & Family Care and in Grooming. On a regional basis, volume increased high single digits in North America and Greater China and increased low single digits in Europe and Latin America, partially offset by a low single digit decrease in Asia Pacific. Volume was unchanged in IMEA.

(2) Other includes the sales mix impact from acquisitions and divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile volume to net sales. Operating Costs Gross margin increased 170 basis points to 53.1% of net sales for the quarter. Gross margin benefited from: • 180 basis points of gross manufacturing cost savings projects (160 basis points net of product and packaging reinvestments), • 70 basis points of help from higher pricing, • 30 basis points of lower commodity costs, and • 20 basis points of help due to lower restructuring costs versus the base period These benefits were partially offset by a 60 basis point decline from unfavorable mix (due to the disproportionate growth of the Home Care and Appliances categories which have lower than company-average margins, as well as mix within segments due to the growth of lower margin product forms and large sizes in certain categories) and a 50 basis-point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. Total SG&A spending increased 5% to $5.1 billion due to increases in both marketing spending and overhead costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 90 basis points to 25.9% primarily due to a reduction in marketing spending and overhead costs as a percentage of net sales. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 20 basis points due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and savings in agency compensation, production costs and advertising spending, partially offset by reinvestments in media. Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales declined 50 basis points due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and productivity savings, partially offset by inflation and other cost increases. Other net operating costs as a percentage of net sales decreased 20 basis points due to a reduction in foreign exchange transactional charges. Productivity-driven cost savings delivered 100 basis points of benefit to SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Non-Operating Expenses and Income Interest expense was $143 million for the quarter, an increase of $43 million versus the prior year period due to an increase in average debt balances. Interest income was $9 million for the quarter, a $27 million decrease versus the prior year period due to lower U.S. interest rates. Other non-operating expense was $369 million, a change of $483 million versus other non-operating income of $114 million in the prior year period primarily due to current period charges of $512 million for the early extinguishment of debt. Income Taxes For the three months ended December 31, 2020, the effective tax rate increased 290 basis points versus the prior year period to 20.3% due to: • a 135 basis-point increase from unfavorable impacts of the geographic mix of current year earnings, caused primarily by disproportionately higher sales and earnings in the U.S., • a 120 basis-point increase related to the prior year tax benefit arising from transactions to simplify our legal entity structure, • a 35 basis-point increase from the impact of the early extinguishment of debt in the current period, and • a 10 basis-point increase from discrete impacts related to uncertain tax positions (30 basis-point favorable impact in the current year versus a 40 basis-point favorable impact in the prior year period). These increases are partially offset by a 10 basis-point decrease from increased excess tax benefits on share-based compensation (90 basis-point reduction in the current period versus 80 basis-point reduction in the prior year period). Net Earnings Operating income increased $898 million, or 20%, to $5.4 billion for the quarter, due to the net sales increase, the increase in gross margin and the decrease in SG&A as a percentage of sales, all of which are described above. Net earnings increased $144 million or 4% to $3.9 billion as the increase in operating income was partially offset by the increase in non-operating expense (due to the debt extinguishment charge) and the increase in income taxes. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of approximately $78 million on net earnings for the quarter, including both transactional charges and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars. Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $137 million or 4%, to $3.9 billion for the quarter. Diluted net earnings per share increased 4% to $1.47. Core net earnings per share increased 15% to $1.64. Core EPS represents diluted net earnings per share excluding current period charges for the early extinguishment of debt and incremental restructuring charges in the base period related to our productivity and cost savings plans. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Six Months Ended December 31, 2020 The following discussion provides a review of results for the six months ended December 31, 2020 versus the six months ended December 31, 2019. Six Months Ended December 31 Amounts in millions, except per share amounts 2020 2019 % Chg Net sales $39,063 $36,038 8% Operating income 10,661 8,772 22% Net earnings 8,195 7,360 11% Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 8,131 7,310 11% Diluted net earnings per common share 3.10 2.77 12% Core net earnings per common share 3.27 2.79 17% Six Months Ended December 31 COMPARISONS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES 2020 2019 Basis Pt Chg Gross margin 52.9% 51.2% 170 Selling, general & administrative expense 25.6% 26.8% (120) Operating income 27.3% 24.3% 300 Earnings before income taxes 26.0% 24.6% 140 Net earnings 21.0% 20.4% 60 Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 20.8% 20.3% 50 Net Sales Net sales for the six months ended December 31, 2020 increased 8% to $39.1 billion on a 6% increase in unit volume. Increased pricing had a 1% positive impact to net sales. Mix had a 2% positive impact to net sales, driven by the disproportionate growth of the North America region and the Home Care and Appliances categories all of which have higher than company-average selling prices. Unfavorable foreign exchange had a 1% negative impact on net sales. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, organic sales increased 9% on a 6% increase in organic volume. Net sales increased double digits in Fabric & Home Care and in Health Care and increased mid-single digits in Beauty, in Baby, Feminine & Family Care and in Grooming. On a regional basis, volume increased double digits in North America driven by innovation and increased demand, particularly in household cleaning, health care and personal hygiene products due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic. Volume increased high single digits in Greater China and increased low single digits in Europe, Latin America and IMEA, partially offset by a low single digits decrease in Asia Pacific.

Operating Costs Gross margin increased 170 basis points to 52.9% of net sales for the fiscal year to date period. Gross margin benefited from: • 150 basis points of gross manufacturing cost savings projects (130 basis points net of product and packaging reinvestments), • 60 basis points of help from higher pricing, • 50 basis points of lower commodity costs, and • 30 basis points of help due to lower restructuring costs versus the base period These benefits were partially offset by a 60 basis point decline from unfavorable mix (due to the disproportionate growth of Home Care and Appliances categories which have lower than company-average margins, as well as mix within segments due to the growth of lower margin product forms and large sizes in certain categories) and a 40 basis-point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. Total SG&A spending increased 3% to $10.0 billion primarily due to increases in both marketing spending and overhead costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 120 basis points to 25.6% due to a reduction in both marketing spending and overhead costs as a percentage of net sales. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and savings in agency compensation, production costs and advertising spending, partially offset by reinvestments in media. Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales declined 70 basis points due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and productivity savings, partially offset by inflation and other cost increases. Other net operating costs as a percentage of net sales decreased 20 basis points due to a reduction in foreign exchange transactional charges. Productivity-driven cost savings delivered 100 basis points of benefit to SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Non-Operating Expenses and Income Interest expense was $279 million for the fiscal year to date, an increase of $71 million versus the prior year period due to an increase in average debt balances. Interest income was $19 million for the fiscal year to date, a $75 million decrease versus the prior year period due to lower U.S. interest rates. Other non-operating expense was $227 million, a change of $444 million versus the prior year non-operating income of $217 million, primarily due to current period charges of $512 million for early debt extinguishment, partially offset by gains from minor brand divestitures and an increase in net non-operating benefits on defined benefit retirement plans caused by annual actuarial assumption updates. Income Taxes For the six months ended December 31, 2020, the effective tax rate increased 240 basis points versus the prior year period to 19.5% due to: • a 135 basis-point increase from unfavorable impacts from geographic mix of current year earnings, caused primarily by disproportionately higher sales and earnings in the U.S., • a 120 basis-point increase related to the prior year tax benefit arising from transactions to simplify our legal entity structure, • a 15 basis-point increase from the impact of the early extinguishment of debt in the current period, and • a 5 basis-point increase from discrete impacts related to uncertain tax positions (5 basis-point favorable impact in the current year versus a 10 basis-point favorable impact in the prior year period). These increases were partially offset by a 35 basis-point decrease from increased excess tax benefits of share-based compensation (175 basis-point reduction in the current period versus 140 basis-point reduction in the prior year period). Net Earnings Operating income increased $1.9 billion, or 22% to $10.7 billion for the six months ended December 31, 2020, due to the net sales increase, the increase in gross margin and the decrease in SG&A as a percentage of sales, all of which are described above. Net earnings increased $0.8 billion or 11% to $8.2 billion for the fiscal year to date period primarily due to the increase in operating income, partially offset by the increase in non-operating expense and the increase in the effective tax rate.

BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSION – Three and Six Months Ended December 31, 2020 The following discussion provides a review of results by reportable business segment. Analysis of the results for the three and six month periods ended December 31, 2020 is provided based on a comparison to the same three and six month periods ended December 31, 2019. The primary financial measures used to evaluate segment performance are net sales and net earnings. The table below provides supplemental information on net sales and net earnings by reportable business segment for the three and six months ended December 31, 2020 versus the comparable prior year period (dollar amounts in millions): Three Months Ended December 31, 2020 Net Sales % Change Versus Year Ago Earnings/(Loss) Before Income Taxes % Change Versus Year Ago Net Earnings % Change Versus Year Ago Beauty $ 3,806 6 % $ 1,196 12 % $ 955 11 % Grooming 1,735 5 % 537 9 % 452 10 % Health Care 2,746 9 % 830 13 % 655 15 % Fabric & Home Care 6,498 12 % 1,599 25 % 1,250 28 % Baby, Feminine & Family Care 4,858 6 % 1,352 26 % 1,044 27 % Corporate 102 N/A (637) N/A (469) N/A Total Company $ 19,745 8 % $ 4,877 8 % $ 3,887 4 % Six Months Ended December 31, 2020 Net Sales % Change Versus Year Ago Earnings/(Loss) Before Income Taxes % Change Versus Year Ago Net Earnings % Change Versus Year Ago Beauty $ 7,591 6 % $ 2,424 12 % $ 1,931 11 % Grooming 3,336 5 % 963 5 % 807 6 % Health Care 5,217 10 % 1,509 19 % 1,180 21 % Fabric & Home Care 13,142 13 % 3,341 28 % 2,599 30 % Baby, Feminine & Family Care 9,581 5 % 2,670 21 % 2,053 21 % Corporate 196 N/A (733) N/A (375) N/A Total Company $ 39,063 8 % $ 10,174 15 % $ 8,195 11 % Beauty Three months ended December 31, 2020 compared with three months ended December 31, 2019 Beauty net sales increased 6% to $3.8 billion during the second fiscal quarter on a 2% increase in unit volume. Higher pricing increased net sales by 2%. Favorable mix added 1% to net sales due to the disproportionate growth of premium products. Favorable foreign exchange impacts increased net sales by 1%. Organic sales increased 5%. Global market share of the Beauty segment decreased 0.6 points. • Hair Care net sales increased mid-single digits due to a low single digit increase in volumes and increased pricing. Organic sales increased mid-single digits. The volume increase was driven by a double digits increase in Greater China due primarily to market growth, a mid-single digits increase in Latin America and low single digits increases in IMEA due to innovation, partially offset by low single digit decreases in North America (due to trade inventory reductions) and in Europe (due to market declines). Global market share of the Hair Care category was unchanged. • Skin and Personal Care net sales increased high single digits due to a low single digit increase in volumes, favorable mix impact due to the disproportionate growth of premium products, increased pricing and favorable foreign exchange impacts. Organic sales also increased mid-single digits. Volume grew high single digits in Greater China driven by innovation and increased consumption of hand soap and sanitizer products due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This growth was partially offset by a double digit volume decrease in IMEA, a mid-single digits decrease in Asia Pacific and a low single digits decrease in Latin America due to pandemic-related consumption decreases. Global market share of the Skin and Personal Care category decreased more than half a point. Net earnings increased 11% to $955 million due to the increase in net sales and a 130 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. The net earnings margin increased due to a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales and an increase in gross margin. The gross margin increase was driven by the positive impacts of manufacturing cost savings and increased pricing, partially offset by the negative impacts of unfavorable mix, due to the relatively lower global growth of the super-premium SKII brand. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase. Six months ended December 31, 2020 compared with six months ended December 31, 2019 Beauty fiscal year to date net sales increased 6% to $7.6 billion on a 4% increase in unit volume.

Net earnings increased 11% to $1.9 billion due to the increase in net sales and a 120 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. The net earnings margin increased due to a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales and a marginal increase in gross margin. The gross margin increase was primarily driven by manufacturing cost savings and increased selling prices, partially offset by the negative impacts of unfavorable mix due to the relatively lower global growth of the super-premium SKII brand. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase. Grooming Three months ended December 31, 2020 compared with three months ended December 31, 2019 Grooming net sales increased 5% to $1.7 billion during the second fiscal quarter on a 4% increase in unit volume.

Global market share of the Grooming segment decreased 0.9 points. • Shave Care net sales decreased low single digits driven by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts and unfavorable mix due to the disproportionate growth of Latin America and IMEA which have lower than category-average selling prices partially offset by a low single digit increase in volume and devaluation-related price increases. Organic sales increased low single digits. Volume increased mid-teens in Greater China and increased high single digits in Latin America and IMEA due to product innovation and increased distribution in certain markets. This was partially offset by low single digits decreases in North America, Europe and Asia Pacific primarily due to pandemic-related consumption decline and competitive activities. Global market share of the Shave Care category decreased slightly. • Appliances net sales increased more than 30% primarily due to a volume increase of more than 20% and favorable foreign exchange impacts. Organic sales increased more than 20%. Volume increased in all regions led by a more than 40% increase in IMEA, a more than 30% increase in North America, a more than 20% increase in Europe and about a 20% increase in Asia Pacific due to innovation and increased consumption of at-home grooming and styling products driven by the pandemic. Global market share of the Appliances category increased more than two points. Net earnings increased 10% to $452 million due to the increase in net sales and a 120 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. The net earnings margin increased due to an increase in gross margin and a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. The gross margin increase was driven by manufacturing cost savings partially offset by the negative impact of unfavorable mix (due to the disproportionate growth of Appliances, which has lower than segment-average margins) and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase.

Global market share of the Appliances category increased more than a point. Net earnings increased 6% to $807 million due to the increase in net sales and a 20 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. The net earnings margin increased primarily due to a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales partially offset by a reduction in gross margin. Gross margin decreased due to the negative impact of unfavorable mix (due to the disproportionate growth of IMEA and Latin America regions and Appliances category, all of which have lower than segment-average margins) and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, partially offset by manufacturing cost savings. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased due to productivity savings and the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase, partially offset by a favorable legal settlement in the base period. Health Care Three months ended December 31, 2020 compared with three months ended December 31, 2019 Health Care net sales increased 9% to $2.7 billion during the second fiscal quarter on a 4% increase in unit volume.

Global market share of the Oral Care category increased more than a point. • Personal Health Care net sales increased mid-single digits versus the prior year period due to a mid-single digit increase in volume and increased pricing partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impact and unfavorable product mix due to decrease in respiratory category (due to lower incidence of cough, cold and flu versus year ago) which has higher than category-average selling prices. Organic sales also increased mid-single digits. The volume growth was driven by a more than 20% increase in Latin America, mid-single digits increases in North America and Asia Pacific and low single digits increases in Europe and IMEA, driven by innovation, increased consumption of certain health care products and increased marketing spending. Global market share of the Personal Health Care category increased more than a point. Net earnings increased 15% to $655 million due to the increase in net sales and a 140 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin increased primarily due to a decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales and a marginal increase in gross margin. The increase in gross margin was driven by the positive impacts of manufacturing cost savings and increased pricing, partially offset by unfavorable mix impacts due to the disproportionate growth of the Oral care category and Latin America both of which have lower than segment-average margins and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased driven by productivity savings, including Merck OTC consumer healthcare acquisition synergies and the positive scale benefits of the net sales increase, partially offset by increased marketing spending.

Corporate Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business segments. These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level; financing and investing activities; certain employee benefit costs; other general corporate items; the gains and losses related to certain divested brands and categories; and certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the reportable segments to U.S. GAAP. The most significant reconciling item relates to income taxes, to adjust from blended statutory rates that are reflected in the reportable segments to the overall Company effective tax rate. Corporate net sales improved by $7 million to $102 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2020 and increased $6 million to $196 million for the fiscal year to date. Corporate net earnings decreased $575 million in the quarter and decreased $571 million for the fiscal year to date period, both primarily due to the $512 million charge for early debt extinguishment in the current period. Corporate net earnings also declined due to higher interest expense, lower interest income, and higher base period tax benefits, partially offset by lower restructuring charges versus the base period, all of which have been described above. Restructuring Program to deliver Productivity and Cost Savings In 2012, the Company initiated a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs and better leverage scale in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overheads. The plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes to fund the Company's growth strategy. In 2017, the Company communicated specific elements of an additional multi-year productivity and cost savings program. As part of this plan, which was largely completed by the end of fiscal 2020, the Company incurred $1.5 billion in total before-tax restructuring costs across fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2021 and onwards, the Company expects to incur restructuring costs within the range of our historical ongoing level of $250 to $500 million before tax. In addition to our restructuring programs, we have additional ongoing savings efforts in our supply chain, marketing and overhead areas that have and are expected to continue to yield additional benefits to our operating margins. Refer to Note 9 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the restructuring program. LIQUIDITY & CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating Activities We generated $10.2 billion of cash from operating activities fiscal year to date, an increase of $1.6 billion versus the prior year period. Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, loss on extinguishment of debt, share-based compensation expense, deferred income taxes and gain on sale of assets), generated $10.4 billion of operating cash flow. Working capital and other impacts used $271 million of cash in the period. Accounts receivable increased, using $462 million of cash, primarily due to sales growth. Inventory increased, consuming $217 million of cash primarily due to increased safety stock levels through the COVID-19 pandemic and business growth. Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities increased, generating $312 million of cash, primarily driven by an increase in marketing accruals, extended payment terms to suppliers and an increase in payables to support the increase in inventory. This was partially offset by the payment of prior fiscal year-end incentive compensation and other salary-related accruals. Investing Activities Investing activities used $1.4 billion of cash fiscal year to date primarily due to capital expenditures. Financing Activities Financing activities used $13.2 billion of net cash fiscal year to date. We used $5.0 billion for treasury stock purchases and $4.1 billion for dividends. We used $5.2 billion for net debt reductions, including $512 million for early debt extinguishment costs related to the early retirement of $2.3 billion of debt. The exercise of stock options and other impacts generated $1.1 billion of cash. As of December 31, 2020, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $7.1 billion. We have short- and long-term debt to meet our financing needs. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements. RECONCILIATION OF MEASURES NOT DEFINED BY U.S. GAAP In accordance with the SEC's Regulation S-K Item 10(e), the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measures. We believe that these measures provide useful perspective on underlying business results and trends (i.e., trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and provide a supplemental measure of year-on-year results. The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measures, but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted. Organic sales growth: Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. This measure is used in assessing achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. Adjusted free cash flow: Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the U.S. Tax Act (the company incurred a transitional tax liability of approximately $3.8 billion in fiscal 2018 from the U.S. Tax Act of 2017 which is payable over a period of 8 years). Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. Management views adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments. Adjusted free cash flow productivity: Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the charges for early debt extinguishment (which are not considered part of our ongoing operations). Management views adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G’s ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. This measure is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. The Company's long-term target is to generate annual adjusted free cash flow productivity at or above 90 percent. Core EPS: Core earnings per share, or Core EPS, is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share adjusted as indicated. Management views this non-GAAP measure as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time. This measure is also used when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation. The Core earnings measures included in the following reconciliation tables refer to the equivalent GAAP measures adjusted as applicable for the following items: Incremental Restructuring: The Company has historically had an ongoing level of restructuring activities. Such activities have resulted in ongoing annual restructuring-related charges of approximately $250 - $500 million before tax. Beginning in 2012, the Company has had a strategic productivity and cost savings initiative that resulted in incremental restructuring charges. The adjustment to Core earnings includes only the restructuring costs above what we believe are the normal recurring level of restructuring costs. In fiscal 2021 and onwards, the Company expects to incur restructuring costs within our historical ongoing level noted above. Early debt extinguishment charges: In the three months ended December 31, 2020, the company recorded after tax charges of $427 million ($512 million before tax), due to early extinguishment of certain long-term debt. These charges represent the difference between the reacquisition price and the par value of the debt extinguished. We do not view the above items to be part of our sustainable results and their exclusion from Core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results. These items are also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation.

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Basis of Presentation These statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of The Procter & Gamble Company and subsidiaries (the ""Company,"" ""Procter & Gamble,"" ""P&G,"" ""we"" or ""our"") contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods reported. However, the results of operations included in such financial statements may not necessarily be indicative of annual results. 2. New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies On July 1, 2020, we adopted ASU 2017-04, ""Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment."" The standard simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by requiring a goodwill impairment to be measured using a single step impairment model, whereby the impairment equals the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the specified reporting units in their entirety. This eliminated the second step of the previous impairment model that required companies to first estimate the fair value of all assets in a reporting unit and measure impairments based on those estimated fair values and a residual measurement approach. It also specifies that any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. The impact of the new standard will depend on the specific facts and circumstances of future individual impairments, if any. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, ""Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting."" The amendments provide optional guidance for a limited time to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform. The new guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The amendments apply only to contracts and hedging relationships that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued due to reference rate reform. These amendments are effective immediately and may be applied prospectively to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated on or before December 31, 2022. We are currently evaluating our contracts and the optional expedients provided by the new standard. No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had, or is expected to have, a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 3. Segment Information Under U.S. GAAP, our operating segments are aggregated into five reportable segments: 1) Beauty, 2) Grooming, 3) Health Care, 4) Fabric & Home Care and 5) Baby, Feminine & Family Care.

Identifiable intangible assets at September 30, 2020 were comprised of: Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Intangible assets with determinable lives $ 8,571 $ ( 5,849 ) Intangible assets with indefinite lives 21,092 — Total identifiable intangible assets $ 29,663 $ ( 5,849 ) Intangible assets with determinable lives consist of brands, patents, technology and customer relationships. The intangible assets with indefinite lives consist of brands. The amortization expense of determinable lived intangible assets for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 was $ 84 and $ 96 , respectively. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment by comparing the estimated fair values of our reporting units and underlying indefinite-lived intangible assets to their respective carrying values. We typically use an income method to estimate fair value of these assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. If the resulting fair value is less than its carrying value, that difference represents an impairment. Our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets occurs during the three months ended December 31. The business unit valuations used to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment depend on a number of significant estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment, margin expansion and Company business plans. We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable. However, future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. To the extent changes in such factors result in a failure to achieve the level of projected cash flows initially used to estimate fair value for purposes of establishing or subsequently impairing the carrying amount of goodwill and related intangible assets, we may need to record non-cash impairment charges in the future. Most of our goodwill reporting units are comprised of a combination of legacy and acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that, at a minimum, exceed two times their underlying carrying values. Certain of our goodwill reporting units, in particular Shave Care and Appliances, are comprised entirely of acquired businesses and as a result, have fair value cushions that are not as high. The Appliances reporting unit has a fair value that significantly exceeds the underlying carrying value. As previously disclosed, the carrying value of the Shave Care reporting unit and the related Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset were impaired during the quarter ended June 30, 2019. Also as previously disclosed, the Shave Care reporting unit fair value exceeded its carrying value by more than 20 % and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset fair value approximated its carrying value as of our most recent impairment testing dates. Accordingly, no impairment charge was recorded during the year ended June 30, 2020. The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the net sales and earnings growth rates (including residual growth rates) and discount rate. The residual growth rate represents the expected rate at which the reporting unit and Gillette brand are expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period. The residual growth rate utilized in our fair value estimates is consistent with the reporting unit and brand operating plans and approximates expected long term category market growth rates. The residual growth rate depends on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, relative currency exchange rates and business activities that impact market share. As a result, the residual growth rate could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes, devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or an increased competitive environment. The discount rate, which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, such as further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar. Spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the U.S. While management can and has implemented strategies to address these events, changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that would trigger future impairment charges of the Shave Care reporting unit's goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. The duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic could also result in additional future impairment charges for the Shave Care reporting unit goodwill and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset. While we have concluded that a triggering event did not occur during the quarter ended September 30, 2020, the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is most susceptible to future impairment risk. Our assessment of the Gillette intangible asset assumes the pandemic’s impact on net sales will be largely eliminated in the second half of the fiscal year. There continues to be an extreme Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. level of uncertainty relating to how the pandemic will evolve and how governments and consumers will react. Accordingly, there is a significant amount of risk related to this key assumption. A more prolonged pandemic could impact the assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset that are significant enough to trigger an impairment. Net sales and earnings growth rates could be negatively impacted by reductions or changes in demand for our shave care products, which may be caused by, among other things: the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine or other travel restrictions, or financial hardship, or by shifts in demand away from one or more of our higher priced products to lower priced products. In addition, relative global and country/regional macroeconomic factors could result in additional and prolonged devaluation of other countries’ currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. Finally, the discount rate utilized in our valuation model could be impacted by changes in the underlying interest rates and risk premiums included in the determination of the cost of capital. As of September 30, 2020, the carrying values of the Shave Care goodwill and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset were $ 12.7 billion and $ 14.1 billion, respectively. The table below provides a sensitivity analysis for the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset, utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the shorter term and residual growth rates and the discount rate, to demonstrate the potential impacts to the estimated fair values. The table below provides, in isolation, the estimated fair value impacts related to a 25 basis-point increase in the discount rate or a 25 basis-point decrease in our shorter-term and residual growth rates, either of which, in isolation, would result in an additional impairment of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset.

Earnings Per Share Basic net earnings per common share are calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble less preferred dividends (net of related tax benefits) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net earnings per common share are calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble by the diluted weighted average number of common shares during the period. The diluted shares include the dilutive effect of stock options and other stock-based awards based on the treasury stock method and the assumed conversion of preferred stock. Net earnings per share were calculated as follows: CONSOLIDATED AMOUNTS Three Months Ended September 30 2020 2019 Net earnings $ 4,308 $ 3,617 Less: Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 31 24 Net earnings attributable to P&G (Diluted) 4,277 3,593 Less: Preferred dividends, net of tax 66 65 Net earnings attributable to P&G available to common shareholders (Basic) $ 4,211 $ 3,528 SHARES IN MILLIONS Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 2,486.1 2,504.0 Add: Effect of dilutive securities Conversion of preferred shares (1) 83.9 87.4 Impact of stock options and other unvested equity awards (2) 55.3 56.1 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 2,625.3 2,647.5 NET EARNINGS PER SHARE (3) Basic $ 1.69 $ 1.41 Diluted $ 1.63 $ 1.36 (1) Despite being included currently in Diluted net earnings per common share, the actual conversion to common stock occurs when the preferred shares are sold. Shares may only be sold after being allocated to the ESOP participants pursuant to the repayment of the ESOP's obligations through 2035. (2) Weighted average outstanding stock options of approximately 1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019 were not included in the Diluted net earnings per share calculation because the options were out of the money or to do so would have been antidilutive (i.e., the total proceeds upon exercise would have exceeded the market value of the underlying common shares). (3) Net earnings per share are calculated on Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble. 6. Share-Based Compensation and Postretirement Benefits The following table provides a summary of our share-based compensation expense and postretirement benefit costs: Three Months Ended September 30 2020 2019 Share-based compensation expense $ 89 $ 110 Net periodic benefit cost for pension benefits (1) 47 40 Net periodic benefit credit for other retiree benefits (1) ( 80 ) ( 52 ) (1) The components of the total net periodic benefit cost for both pension benefits and other retiree benefits for these interim periods, on an annualized basis, do not differ materially from the amounts disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. 7. Risk Management Activities and Fair Value Measurements As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. There have been no significant changes in our risk management policies or activities during the three months ended September 30, 2020. The Company has not changed its valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period. The Company recognizes transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of each quarter. There were no transfers between levels during the periods presented. Also, there was no significant activity within the Level 3 assets and liabilities during the periods presented. There were no significant assets or liabilities that were remeasured at fair value on a non-recurring basis for the three months ended September 30, 2020. Other investments had a fair value of $ 66 and $ 67 as of September 30, 2020 and June 30, 2020, respectively, and are presented in Other noncurrent assets. The Company's investments measured at fair value are generally classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Cash equivalents were $ 12.2 billion and $ 14.6 billion as of September 30, 2020 and June 30, 2020, respectively, and are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. There are no other material investment balances classified as Level 1 or Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy or using net asset value as a practical expedient. Fair values are generally estimated based upon quoted market prices for similar instruments. The fair value of long-term debt was $ 29.5 billion and $ 29.0 billion as of September 30, 2020 and June 30, 2020, respectively. This includes the current portion of long-term debt instruments ($ 2.5 billion as of September 30, 2020 and June 30, 2020). Certain long-term debt (debt designated as a fair value hedge) is recorded at fair value. All other long-term debt is recorded at amortized cost but is measured at fair value for disclosure purposes. We consider our debt to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Fair values are generally estimated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments. Disclosures about Financial Instruments The notional amounts and fair values of financial instruments used in hedging transactions as of September 30, 2020 and June 30, 2020 are as follows: Notional Amount Fair Value Asset Fair Value (Liability) September 30, 2020 June 30, 2020 September 30, 2020 June 30, 2020 September 30, 2020 June 30, 2020 DERIVATIVES IN FAIR VALUE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Interest rate contracts $ 7,339 $ 7,114 $ 276 $ 269 $ — $ — DERIVATIVES IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Foreign currency interest rate contracts $ 8,089 $ 3,856 $ 21 $ 26 $ ( 196 ) $ ( 41 ) TOTAL DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS $ 15,428 $ 10,970 $ 297 $ 295 $ ( 196 ) $ ( 41 ) DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS Foreign currency contracts $ 5,944 $ 5,986 $ 40 $ 23 $ ( 32 ) $ ( 25 ) TOTAL DERIVATIVES AT FAIR VALUE $ 21,372 $ 16,956 $ 337 $ 318 $ ( 228 ) $ ( 66 ) The fair value of the interest rate derivative asset/(liability) directly offsets the cumulative amount of the fair value hedging adjustment included in the carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation. The carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation, which includes the unamortized discount or premium and the fair value adjustment, was $ 7.6 billion and $ 7.4 billion as of September 30, 2020 and June 30, 2020, respectively. In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges. The carrying value of those debt instruments designated as net investment hedges, which includes the adjustment for the foreign currency transaction gain or loss on those instruments, was $ 12.5 billion and $ 16.0 billion as of September 30, 2020 and June 30, 2020, respectively. The increase in the notional balance of derivative instruments designated as net investment hedges is largely offset by the decrease in the principal balance of debt instruments designated as net investment hedges, reflecting the Company’s decision to leverage favorable interest rates in the foreign currency swap market versus the short-term debt market. All derivative assets are presented in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Other noncurrent assets. All derivative liabilities are presented in Accrued and other liabilities or Other noncurrent liabilities. Changes in the fair value of net investment hedges are recognized in the Foreign currency translation component of Other comprehensive income (OCI). All of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. Before tax gains/(losses) on our financial instruments in hedging relationships are categorized as follows: Amount of Gain/(Loss) Recognized in OCI on Derivatives Three Months Ended September 30 2020 2019 DERIVATIVES IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS (1) (2) Foreign exchange contracts $ ( 186 ) $ 113 (1) For the derivatives in net investment hedging relationships, the amount of gain excluded from effectiveness testing, which was recognized in earnings, was $ 14 and $ 19 for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. (2) In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges. The amount of gain/(loss) recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (AOCI) for such instruments was $( 646 ) and $ 609 for the three months ended September 30, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Amount of Gain/(Loss) Recognized in Earnings Three Months Ended September 30 2020 2019 DERIVATIVES IN FAIR VALUE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Interest rate contracts $ 7 $ 90 DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS Foreign currency contracts $ 106 $ ( 97 ) The gain/(loss) on the derivatives in fair value hedging relationships is fully offset by the mark-to-market impact of the related exposure. These are both recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in Interest expense. The gain/(loss) on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is substantially offset by the currency mark-to-market of the related exposure. These are both recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A). 8. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss) The table below presents the changes in AOCI, including the reclassifications out of AOCI by component: Investment Securities Post-retirement Benefits Foreign Currency Translation Total AOCI Balance at June 30, 2020 $ ( 1 ) $ ( 4,350 ) $ ( 11,814 ) $ ( 16,165 ) OCI before reclassifications (1) 6 ( 152 ) 352 206 Amounts reclassified from AOCI into the Consolidated Statements of Earnings (2) — 83 — 83 Net current period OCI 6 ( 69 ) 352 289 Less: Other comprehensive income/(loss) attributable to non-controlling interests — — 5 5 Balance at September 30, 2020 $ 5 $ ( 4,419 ) $ ( 11,467 ) $ ( 15,881 ) (1) Net of tax expense/(benefit) of $ 0 , $( 42 ) and $( 195 ) for gains/losses on investment securities, postretirement benefit items and foreign currency translation, respectively. (2) Net of tax expense/(benefit) of $ 0 , $ 24 and $ 0 for gains/losses on investment securities, postretirement benefit items and foreign currency translation, respectively. The below provides additional details on amounts reclassified from AOCI into the Consolidated Statements of Earnings: • Investment securities: amounts reclassified from AOCI into Other non-operating income, net. • Postretirement benefits: amounts reclassified from AOCI into Other non-operating income, net and included in the computation of net periodic postretirement costs. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. 9. Restructuring Program The Company has historically incurred an ongoing annual level of restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Before-tax costs incurred under the ongoing program have generally ranged from $ 250 to $ 500 annually. In fiscal 2017, the Company announced specific elements of an additional multi-year productivity and cost savings plan to further reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, certain marketing activities and overhead expenses, which resulted in incremental restructuring charges through fiscal 2020. We expect fiscal 2021 restructuring charges to be more in line with our ongoing level of spending noted above. Restructuring costs incurred consist primarily of costs to separate employees, asset-related costs to exit facilities and other costs. Employee separation costs relate to severance packages that were primarily voluntary and the amounts were calculated based on salary levels and past service periods. Severance costs related to voluntary separations are generally charged to earnings when the employee accepts the offer. Asset-related costs consist of both asset write-downs and accelerated depreciation. Asset write-downs relate to the establishment of a new fair value basis for assets held-for-sale or disposal. These assets were written down to the lower of their current carrying basis or amounts expected to be realized upon disposal, less minor disposal costs. Charges for accelerated depreciation relate to long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period. These assets relate primarily to manufacturing consolidations and technology standardizations. The asset-related charges will not have a significant impact on future depreciation charges. Other restructuring-type charges are incurred as a direct result of the restructuring program. Such charges primarily include asset removal and termination of contracts related to supply chain optimization. The following table presents restructuring activity for the three months ended September 30, 2020. The majority of the charges during the three months ended September 30, 2020 and the remaining reserve balance as of September 30, 2020 related to employee separations. Reserve Balance Three Months Ended September 30, 2020 Reserve Balance June 30, 2020 Cost Incurred and Charged to Expense Cost Paid/Settled September 30, 2020 Total $ 472 $ 22 $ ( 191 ) $ 303 10. Commitments and Contingencies Litigation We are subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental, patent and trademark matters, labor and employment matters and tax. While considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management and our counsel, the ultimate resolution of the various lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior manufacturing and waste disposal practices. Based on currently available information, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of environmental remediation will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Income Tax Uncertainties The Company is present in approximately 70 countries and over 150 taxable jurisdictions and, at any point in time, has 40 – 50 jurisdictional audits underway at various stages of completion. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite our belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitations. Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate. We have tax years open ranging from 2008 and forward. We are generally not able to reliably estimate the ultimate settlement amounts until the close of the audit. Based on information currently available, we anticipate that over the next 12 month period, audit activity could be completed related to uncertain tax positions in multiple jurisdictions for which we have accrued existing liabilities of approximately $ 60 , including interest and penalties. Additional information on the Commitments and Contingencies of the Company can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K/A for the year ended June 30, 2020. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. Item 2.

A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected herein, is included in the section titled ""Economic Conditions and Uncertainties"" and the section titled ""Risk Factors"" (Part II, Item 1A) of this Form 10-Q. The purpose of Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is to provide an understanding of Procter & Gamble's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes. The MD&A is organized in the following sections: • Overview • Summary of Results – Three Months Ended September 30, 2020 • Economic Conditions and Uncertainties • Results of Operations – Three Months Ended September 30, 2020 • Business Segment Discussion – Three Months Ended September 30, 2020 • Liquidity and Capital Resources • Reconciliation of Measures Not Defined by U.S. GAAP Throughout the MD&A, we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales and net earnings. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), consisting of organic sales growth, core net earnings per share (Core EPS), adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity. The explanation at the end of the MD&A provides the definition of these non-GAAP measures, details on the use and the derivation of these measures, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures. Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and market consumption in the MD&A are based on a combination of vendor purchased traditional brick-and-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales of our products in dollar terms on a constant currency basis, relative to all product sales in the category. The Company measures fiscal year to date market shares through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months as compared to the end of the reporting period. Management also uses unit volume growth to evaluate and explain drivers of changes in net sales. Organic volume growth reflects year-over-year changes in unit volume excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and certain one-time items if applicable and is used to explain changes in organic sales. OVERVIEW P&G is a global leader in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world.

The following table provides the percentage of net sales and net earnings by reportable business segment for the three months ended September 30, 2020 (excluding net sales and net earnings in Corporate): Three Months Ended September 30, 2020 Net Sales Net Earnings Beauty 20% 23% Grooming 8% 8% Health Care 13% 13% Fabric & Home Care 34% 32% Baby, Feminine & Family Care 25% 24% Total Company 100% 100% SUMMARY OF RESULTS Following are highlights of results for the three months ended September 30, 2020 versus the three months ended September 30, 2019: • Net sales increased 9% to $19.3 billion, driven by a mid-teens increase in Fabric & Home Care, a double digit increase in Health Care, a high single digits increase in Beauty, a mid-single digits increase in Grooming and a low single digits increase in Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, also increased 9%. Organic sales increased mid-teens in Fabric & Home Care, increased double digits in Health Care, increased high single digits in Beauty and increased mid-single digits in Grooming and in Baby, Feminine & Family Care. • Net earnings were $4.3 billion, an increase of $691 million or 19% versus the prior year period due to the increase in net sales and an increase in operating margins, partially offset by an increase in the current period income tax rate. • Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $684 million or 19% versus the prior year period to $4.3 billion. • Diluted net earnings per share (EPS) increased 20% to $1.63 due primarily to the increase in net earnings. • Diluted net earnings per share increased 19% versus the prior year Core net earnings per share which excludes incremental restructuring charges in the base period. • Operating cash flow was $4.7 billion. Adjusted free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less capital expenditures and certain other impacts, was $4.1 billion. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 95%. ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES Global Economic Conditions . Our products are sold in numerous countries across North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa with more than half our sales generated outside the United States. As such, we are exposed to and impacted by global macro-economic factors, U.S. and foreign government policies and foreign exchange fluctuations. Current global economic conditions are highly volatile due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in both market size contractions in certain countries due to economic slowdowns and government restrictions on movement, as well as market size increases in certain countries due to pantry loading and increased consumption of household cleaning and personal health and hygiene products by consumers. Other macro-economic factors also remain dynamic, and any causes of market size contraction, such as reduced GDP in commodity-dependent economies, greater political unrest or instability in the Middle East, Central & Eastern Europe, certain Latin American markets, the Hong Kong market in Greater China and the Korean peninsula and economic uncertainty related to the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, could reduce our sales or erode our operating margin, in either case reducing our net earnings and cash flows. Changes in Costs. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, transportation costs and our own productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities, in particular, certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp, and volatility in the market price of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs. Disruptions in our manufacturing, supply and distribution operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic may also impact our costs. If we are unable to manage these impacts through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions, as well as through consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. Sales could also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on consumption of our products. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including outsourcing projects, supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. In fiscal 2017, we communicated specific elements of a multi-year cost reduction program which is resulting in targeted enrollment reductions and other savings. If we are not successful in executing and sustaining these changes, there could be a negative impact on our gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. Foreign Exchange . We have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates. Translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation of transaction-related working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. In the past two fiscal years, as well as the current year, the U.S. dollar has strengthened versus a number of foreign currencies, leading to lower sales and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts. Certain countries experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations, like Argentina, Brazil, Russia Turkey and the European Union have previously had, and could in the future have, a significant impact on our sales, costs and net earnings. Increased pricing in response to certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could also have a negative impact on consumption of our products, which would affect our sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. Government Policies . Our net earnings could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government tax policies, for example, any regulatory guidance issued as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017 (the U.S. Tax Act) and the current work being led by the OECD for the G20 focused on ""Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy."" The breadth of this project extends beyond pure digital businesses and is likely to impact all multinational businesses by redefining jurisdictional taxation rights. Further, our sales, net earnings and cash flows may be impacted by U.S. and foreign government policies to manage the COVID-19 pandemic, such as movement restrictions or site closures. Additionally, we attempt to carefully manage our debt, currency and other exposures in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and pricing controls, such as Nigeria, Algeria, Egypt, Argentina and Turkey. Further, our sales, net earnings and cash flows could be affected by changes to international trade agreements in North America and elsewhere, including increases of import tariffs, both currently effective and future potential changes. Changes in government policies in these areas might cause an increase or decrease in our sales, gross margin, operating margin, net earnings and cash flows. COVID-19 Pandemic Disclosures The Company’s priorities during the COVID-19 pandemic continue to be protecting the health and safety of our employees; maximizing the availability of products that help consumers with their health, hygiene and cleaning needs; and using our employees’ talents and our resources to help society meet and overcome the current challenges. Because the Company sells products that are essential to the daily lives of consumers, the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a materially negative impact to our consolidated sales, net earnings and cash flows. The pandemic has had both positive and negative impacts to our sales and net earnings during the quarter ended September 30, 2020. We have experienced a significant increase in demand and consumption of certain of our product categories (fabric, home cleaning and hygiene products) primarily in North America and Europe, caused in part by changing consumer habits, pantry stocking and retailer inventory replenishment, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, contributing to increases in sales, net earnings and cash flows. At the same time, we experienced a decrease in sales due to the economic slowdown and restricted consumer movements in certain regions, including IMEA (India, Middle East and Africa), Asia Pacific and Latin America, in certain channels including travel retail and professional, and in certain of our beauty and grooming products. In the future, the pandemic may cause reduced demand for our products if it results in a recessionary global economic environment. Demand in certain countries in Latin America, Asia Pacific, and IMEA may be particularly susceptible to recession. It could also lead to volatility in consumer access to our products due to government actions impacting our ability to produce and ship products or impacting consumers’ movements and access to our products. We believe that over the long term, there will continue to be strong demand for categories in which we operate, particularly our products that deliver essential health, hygiene and cleaning benefits. However, the timing and extent of demand recovery in certain markets in Asia Pacific, IMEA and Latin America, the resumption of international travel, the timing and impact of potential consumer pantry destocking in markets including North America and Europe, and product demand volatility caused by future economic trends are unclear. Accordingly, there may be heightened volatility in sales, net earnings and cash flows during and subsequent to the duration of the pandemic. Our retail customers are also being impacted by the pandemic. Their success in addressing the issues and maintaining their operations could impact consumer access to, and as a result, sales of our products. Our ability to continue to operate without any significant negative impacts will in part depend on our ability to protect our employees and our supply chain. The Company has endeavored to follow actions recommended by governments and health authorities to protect our employees world-wide, with particular measures in place for those working in our plants and distribution facilities. We have also worked closely with local and national officials to keep our manufacturing facilities open due to the essential nature of the majority of our products. We have been able to broadly maintain our operations, but we have experienced some disruption in our supply chain in certain markets in Asia Pacific and IMEA due primarily to the restriction of employee movements as well as increased transportation and manufacturing costs. We intend to continue to work with government authorities and implement our employee safety measures to ensure that we are able to continue manufacturing and distributing our products during the pandemic. However, uncertainty resulting from the pandemic could result in an unforeseen disruption to our supply chain (for example a closure of a key manufacturing or distribution facility or the inability of a key material or transportation supplier to source and transport materials) that could impact our operations. Because the pandemic has not had a material negative impact on our operations or demand for our products and resulting sales and net earnings, it has also not negatively impacted the Company’s liquidity position. We continue to generate operating cash flows to meet our short-term liquidity needs, and we expect to maintain access to the capital markets enabled by our strong short- and long-term credit ratings. We have also not observed any material impairments of our assets or a significant change in the fair value of assets due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For additional information on risk factors that could impact our results, please refer to “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of the Company's Form 10-K/A for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Three Months Ended September 30, 2020 The following discussion provides a review of results for the three months ended September 30, 2020 versus the three months ended September 30, 2019. Three Months Ended September 30 Amounts in millions, except per share amounts 2020 2019 % Chg Net sales $19,318 $17,798 9% Operating income 5,281 4,290 23% Net earnings 4,308 3,617 19% Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 4,277 3,593 19% Diluted net earnings per common share 1.63 1.36 20% Core net earnings per common share 1.63 1.37 19% Three Months Ended September 30 COMPARISONS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES 2020 2019 Basis Pt Chg Gross margin 52.7% 51.0% 170 Selling, general & administrative expense 25.3% 26.9% (160) Operating income 27.3% 24.1% 320 Earnings before income taxes 27.4% 24.4% 300 Net earnings 22.3% 20.3% 200 Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 22.1% 20.2% 190 Net Sales Net sales for the quarter increased 9% to $19.3 billion on a 7% increase in unit volume. Increased pricing had a 1% positive impact to net sales. Mix had a 1% positive impact to net sales, driven by the disproportionate growth of the North America region and the Home Care, Personal Care, Health Care and Appliances businesses all of which have higher than company-average selling prices. Foreign exchange had a negative 1% impact on net sales. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, organic sales also increased 9% on a 7% increase in organic volume. Net sales increased mid-teens in Fabric & Home Care, increased double digits in Health Care, increased high single digits in Beauty, increased mid-single digits in Grooming and increased low single digits in Baby, Feminine & Family Care. On a regional basis, volume increased mid-teens in North America driven by innovation, increased demand and retailer inventory rebuild, particularly in household cleaning, health care and personal hygiene products due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic. Volume increased high single digits in Greater China, increased mid-single digits in IMEA and Latin America and increased low single digits in Europe. These increases were partially offset by a low single digits volume decrease in Asia Pacific primarily due to the base period inventory build by retailers in Japan in advance of a VAT increase. Net Sales Change Drivers 2020 vs. 2019 (Three Months Ended September 30) (1) Volume with Acquisitions & Divestitures Volume Excluding Acquisitions & Divestitures Foreign Exchange Price Mix Other (2) Net Sales Growth Beauty 7% 7% (1)% 1% —% —% 7% Grooming 5% 5% (2)% 2% —% —% 5% Health Care 9% 9% (1)% 1% 2% —% 11% Fabric & Home Care 10% 10% —% —% 4% —% 14% Baby, Feminine & Family Care 3% 3% (1)% 1% —% —% 3% Total Company 7% 7% (1)% 1% 1% 1% 9% (1) Net sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently applied. (2) Other includes the sales mix impact from acquisitions and divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile volume to net sales. Operating Costs Gross margin increased 170 basis points to 52.7% of net sales for the quarter. Gross margin benefited from: • 120 basis points of gross manufacturing cost savings projects (100 basis points net of product and packaging reinvestments), • 70 basis points of lower commodity costs, • 40 basis points of help from higher pricing, • 30 basis points of help due to higher restructuring costs in the base period and • 20 basis points of help from other impacts These benefits were partially offset by a 60 basis point decline from unfavorable mix (due to the disproportionate growth of Home Care and Appliances categories which have lower than company average margins, as well as mix within segments due to the growth of lower margin product forms and large sizes in certain categories) and a 30 basis-point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. Total SG&A spending increased 2% to $4.9 billion primarily due to increases in marketing spending. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 160 basis points to 25.3% due to a reduction in marketing spending and overhead costs as a percentage of net sales. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 50 basis points due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and savings in agency compensation, production costs and advertising spending, partially offset by reinvestments in media. Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales declined 100 basis points due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and productivity savings, partially offset by inflation and other cost increases. Other net operating costs as a percentage of net sales was unchanged. Productivity-driven cost savings delivered 110 basis points of benefit to SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Non-Operating Expenses and Income Interest expense was $136 million for the quarter, an increase of $28 million versus the prior year period due to an increase in average debt balances. Interest income was $10 million for the quarter, a $48 million decrease versus the prior year period due to lower average cash and investment securities balances and reduced U.S. interest rates. Other non-operating income was $142 million, an increase of $39 million due to gains from minor brand divestitures and an increase in net non-operating benefits on defined benefit retirement plans caused by annual actuarial assumption updates. Income Taxes For the three months ended September 30, 2020, the effective tax rate increased 200 basis points versus the prior year period to 18.7% due to: • a 120 basis-point increase related to the prior year tax benefit arising from transactions to simplify our legal entity structure and • a 140 basis-point increase from unfavorable impacts from geographic mix of current year earnings, caused primarily by disproportionately higher sales and earnings in the U.S. These increases are partially offset by: • a 10 basis-point decrease from discrete impacts related to uncertain tax positions (5 basis-point unfavorable impact in the current year versus a 15 basis-point unfavorable impact in the prior year period) and • a 50 basis-point decrease from higher excess tax benefits on share-based compensation (250 basis-point reduction in the current period versus 200 basis-point reduction in the prior year period). Net Earnings Operating income increased $991 million, or 23% to $5.3 billion for the quarter, due to the net sales increase, the increase in gross margin and the decrease in SG&A as a percentage of sales, all of which are described above. Net earnings increased $691 million or 19% to $4.3 billion primarily due to the increase in operating income, partially offset by the increase in the effective tax rate. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of approximately $100 million on net earnings for the quarter, including both transactional charges and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars. Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $684 million or 19% to $4.3 billion for the quarter. Diluted net earnings per share increased 20% to $1.63 versus the base period diluted net EPS and increased 19% versus the base period Core EPS which represents diluted net earnings per share excluding incremental restructuring charges in the base period related to our productivity and cost savings plans. BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSION – Three Months Ended September 30, 2020 The following discussion provides a review of results by reportable business segment. Analysis of the results for the three month period ended September 30, 2020 is provided based on a comparison to the same three month period ended September 30, 2019. The primary financial measures used to evaluate segment performance are net sales and net earnings. The table below provides supplemental information on net sales and net earnings by reportable business segment for the three months ended September 30, 2020 versus the comparable prior year period (dollar amounts in millions): Three Months Ended September 30, 2020 Net Sales % Change Versus Year Ago Earnings/(Loss) Before Income Taxes % Change Versus Year Ago Net Earnings % Change Versus Year Ago Beauty $ 3,786 7 % $ 1,228 12 % $ 976 12 % Grooming 1,601 5 % 426 — % 355 1 % Health Care 2,471 11 % 679 26 % 525 31 % Fabric & Home Care 6,644 14 % 1,743 30 % 1,349 31 % Baby, Feminine & Family Care 4,723 3 % 1,318 16 % 1,010 16 % Corporate 93 N/A (97) N/A 93 N/A Total Company $ 19,318 9 % $ 5,297 22 % $ 4,308 19 % Beauty Three months ended September 30, 2020 compared with three months ended September 30, 2019 Beauty net sales increased 7% to $3.8 billion during the first fiscal quarter on a 7% increase in unit volume. Higher pricing increased net sales by 1%. Unfavorable foreign exchange impacts reduced net sales by 1%. Organic sales increased 7%. Global market share of the Beauty segment decreased 0.4 points. • Hair Care net sales increased mid-single digits, due to a mid-single digit increase in volumes and increased pricing, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Organic sales increased high single digits. The volume increase was driven by a double digits increase in Greater China, a high single digits increase in North America, a mid-single digits increase in Latin America and low single digits increases in Asia Pacific and IMEA due to innovation, increased demand following pandemic-related shutdowns and inventory restocking. Global market share of the Hair Care category decreased slightly. • Skin and Personal Care net sales increased high single digits, due to a double digit increase in volumes, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange and unfavorable mix impacts. Organic sales also increased high single digits. Volume grew more than 20% in Greater China, grew double digits in Asia Pacific and grew high single digits in North America driven by innovation and increased consumption due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Global market share of the Skin and Personal Care category decreased slightly. Net earnings increased 12% to $976 million due to the increase in net sales and a 120 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. The net earnings margin increased due to a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales partially offset by a reduction in gross margin and an increase in tax rates due to unfavorable geographic mix of earnings. The gross margin decrease was primarily driven by the negative impacts of unfavorable mix, due to the relatively lower global growth of the super-premium SKII brand, partially offset by increased pricing. The decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and reduced marketing spending. Grooming Three months ended September 30, 2020 compared with three months ended September 30, 2019 Grooming net sales increased 5% to $1.6 billion during the first fiscal quarter on a 5% increase in unit volume. Unfavorable foreign exchange had a negative 2% impact on net sales. Pricing had a positive 2% impact on net sales. Organic sales increased 6%. Global market share of the Grooming segment decreased 1.8 points. • Shave Care net sales decreased low single digits as a low single digit increase in volume, was more than offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts and unfavorable mix impact due to the disproportionate growth of lower priced products in IMEA. Organic sales were unchanged. Volume increased more than 20% in IMEA and increased low single digits in North America and Latin America due to product innovation and increased distribution in certain markets. This was partially offset by mid-single digits decreases in Europe and Asia Pacific primarily due to pandemic-related consumption decline. Global market share of the Shave Care category decreased more than half a point. • Appliances net sales increased more than 40% primarily due to a volume increase of more than 30%. Organic sales increased more than 30%. Volume increased in all regions led by more than a 50% increase in North America, more than a 40% increase in Europe and a high-teens increase in Asia Pacific due to innovation and increased consumption of at-home grooming and styling products driven by the pandemic. Global market share of the Appliances category increased more than a point. Net earnings increased 1% to $355 million due to the increase in net sales partially offset by a 90 basis-point decrease in net earnings margin. The net earnings margin declined primarily due to a decrease in gross margin, partially offset by a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin decreased due to the negative impact of unfavorable mix (due to the disproportionate growth of IMEA, which has lower than segment average margins) and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased due to productivity savings and the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase, partially offset by a favorable legal settlement in the base period. Health Care Three months ended September 30, 2020 compared with three months ended September 30, 2019 Health Care net sales increased 11% to $2.5 billion during the first fiscal quarter on a 9% increase in unit volume. Unfavorable foreign exchange impacts decreased net sales by 1%. Pricing had a 1% positive impact to net sales for the quarter. Favorable mix increased net sales by 2% due to the disproportionate growth of the North America region and power brush products both of which have higher than segment average selling prices. Organic sales increased 12%. Global market share of the Health Care segment increased 1.4 points. • Oral Care net sales increased mid-teens due to a high single digit increase in volume, favorable mix impacts due to the disproportionate growth of North America and premium power brush products, and increased pricing partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Organic sales also increased mid-teens. Volume grew in all regions, led by double digits growth in North America and IMEA and high single digits growth in Europe, Greater China and Latin America driven by innovation. Global market share of the Oral Care category increased less than a point. • Personal Health Care net sales increased high single digits versus the prior year period due to a high single digit increase in volume and increased pricing partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Organic sales also increased high single digits. The volume increase was driven by double digits growth in North America, Europe, IMEA and Latin America and high single digits growth in Asia Pacific, driven by innovation and increased marketing spending. Global market share of the Personal Health Care category increased two points. Net earnings increased 31% to $525 million, due to the increase in net sales and a 310 basis-points increase in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin increased due to an increase in gross margin, a decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales and a gain on a minor brand divestiture in the current period. The increase in gross margin was driven by the positive impacts of manufacturing cost savings and increased pricing, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to the positive scale benefits of the net sales increase and a reduction in other operating expenses due to costs related to the Merck OTC consumer healthcare acquisition in the base period. Fabric & Home Care Three months ended September 30, 2020 compared with three months ended September 30, 2019 Fabric & Home Care net sales increased 14% to $6.6 billion during the first fiscal quarter on an 10% increase in unit volume. Positive mix impacts increased net sales by 4% due to the disproportionate growth of the North America region and the Home Care category, which have higher than segment average prices. Pricing and foreign exchange had no net impact to net sales. Organic sales also increased 14%. Global market share of the Fabric & Home Care segment increased 1.2 points. • Fabric Care net sales increased high single digits due to a high single digit increase in volume and positive mix impact due to the disproportionate growth of premium products and the North America region. Organic sales also increased high single digits. Increased volume was driven by high teens growth in North America, high single digits growth in Latin America, mid-single digits growth in Greater China and low single digits growth in Europe, all due to product innovation and consumption increases in certain markets related to the COVID-19 pandemic. This was partially offset by a high single digits decline in Asia Pacific, primarily due to the base period increase in retailer inventories prior to a VAT increase in Japan. Global market share of the Fabric Care category increased more than a point. • Home Care net sales increased more than 30%, primarily due to a volume increase of more than 20%, a positive mix impact due to the disproportionate growth of premium products and the North America region and increased pricing. Organic sales also increased more than 30%. Volume increased in all regions led by more than 30% growth in North America, more than 20% growth in Europe, Latin America and IMEA and mid-teens growth in Asia Pacific all due to consumption increases related to the COVID-19 pandemic, product innovation and to a lesser extent, retailer inventory restocking in the U.S. Global market share of the Home Care category increased more than a point. Net earnings increased 31% to $1.3 billion due to the increase in net sales and a 270 basis-points increase in net earnings margin. The net earnings margin increase was due to an increase in gross margin and a decrease in SG&A as a percentage of sales. The gross margin increase was driven by manufacturing cost savings and a reduction in commodity costs, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to the positive scale benefits of the net sales increase. Baby, Feminine & Family Care Three months ended September 30, 2020 compared with three months ended September 30, 2019 Baby, Feminine & Family Care net sales increased 3% to $4.7 billion during the first fiscal quarter on a 3% increase in unit volume. Unfavorable foreign exchange impacts decreased net sales by 1%. Higher pricing increased net sales by 1%. Mix had no impact to net sales. Organic sales increased 4%. Global market share of the Baby, Feminine & Family Care segment decreased 0.4 points. • Net sales in Baby Care decreased mid-single digits due to a mid-single digit decrease in volume and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Organic sales decreased low single digits. Volume decreased mid-teens in Latin America (due to market contraction), decreased double digits in Asia Pacific (due primarily to the base period increase in retailer inventories prior to a VAT increase in Japan) and IMEA (due to pandemic-related retailer inventory reductions and market contraction) and decreased high single digits in Greater China (primarily due to competitive activity and consumer pantry destocking). This was partially offset by mid-single digits growth in North America (due to consumption increase in certain products and pandemic-related retailer inventory restocking). Global market share of the Baby Care category decreased less than a point. • Feminine Care net sales increased mid-single digits due to a low single digit increase in volume, increased pricing and positive mix impact due to the disproportionate growth of the North America region and premium products primarily in Greater China, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. Organic sales increased high single digits. Volume increased over 20% in Asia Pacific due to a new launch in the adult incontinence category in Japan. Volume increased high single digits in North America (primarily due to pandemic-related trade inventory increases and innovation) and in IMEA (primarily due to market growth). This was partially offset by a mid-single digits decline in Greater China and a low single digits decline in Europe and Latin America primarily due to the COVID-19 related consumption declines. Global market share of the Feminine Care category increased more than half a point. • Net sales in Family Care, which is predominantly a North American business, increased double digits driven by a double digit increase in volumes and increased pricing driven by lower consumer promotions, partially offset by unfavorable mix impact due to the disproportionate growth of larger pack sizes. Organic sales also increased double digits. The volume increase was driven by COVID-19 related consumption increase and to a lesser extent retailer inventory restocking. North America share of the Family Care category decreased a point. Net earnings increased 16% to $1.0 billion due to the increase in net sales and a 230 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin increased primarily due to an increase in gross margin and a marginal decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin increased due to manufacturing cost savings and a reduction in commodity costs, partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impacts. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased marginally due to the positive scale benefits of the net sales increase. Corporate Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business segments. These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level; financing and investing activities; certain employee benefit costs; other general corporate items; the gains and losses related to certain divested brands and categories; and certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the reportable segments to U.S. GAAP. The most significant reconciling item relates to income taxes, to adjust from blended statutory rates that are reflected in the reportable segments to the overall Company effective tax rate. Corporate net sales decreased $2 million to $93 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2020. Corporate net earnings improved by $3 million in the quarter as lower restructuring charges versus the base period and lower overheads spending were partially offset by higher interest expense, lower interest income and tax benefits in the base period, all of which have been described above. Restructuring Program to deliver Productivity and Cost Savings In 2012, the Company initiated a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs and better leverage scale in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overheads. The plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes to fund the Company's growth strategy. In 2017, the Company communicated specific elements of an additional multi-year productivity and cost savings program. As part of this plan, which was largely completed by the end of fiscal 2020, the Company incurred $1.5 billion in total before-tax restructuring costs across fiscal 2019 and fiscal 2020. In fiscal 2021 and onwards, the Company expects to incur restructuring costs within the range of our historical ongoing level of $250 to $500 million before tax. In addition to our restructuring programs, we have additional ongoing savings efforts in our supply chain, marketing and overhead areas that have and are expected to continue to yield additional benefits to our operating margins. Refer to Note 9 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the restructuring program. LIQUIDITY & CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating Activities We generated $4.7 billion of cash from operating activities fiscal year to date, an increase of $570 million versus the prior year period. Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, deferred income taxes and gain on sale of assets), generated $5.2 billion of operating cash flow. Working capital and other impacts used $510 million of cash in the period. Accounts receivable increased, using $825 million of cash, primarily due to sales growth. Days sales outstanding also increased about two days driven by a higher relative amount of sales towards the end of the quarter. Inventory increased, consuming $137 million of cash primarily due to holiday seasonality builds in certain categories and to support business growth. Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities increased, generating $442 million of cash, primarily due to an increase in trade-related payables and accruals (approximately $650 million to support business growth and to a lesser extent, extended payment terms to suppliers) and increased taxes payable caused by growth in earnings and the timing of estimated payments (approximately $440 million), partially offset by the payment of prior fiscal year-end incentive compensation and other salary-related accruals. Investing Activities Investing activities used $829 million of cash fiscal year to date primarily due to capital expenditures of $850 million. Financing Activities Our financing activities used $6.7 billion of net cash fiscal year to date. We used $2.0 billion for treasury stock purchases, $2.0 billion for dividends and $3.6 billion related to the reduction of short-term debt due primarily to the maturity of commercial paper. The exercise of stock options and other impacts generated $893 million of cash. As of September 30, 2020, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $4.0 billion. We have short- and long-term debt to meet our financing needs. Subsequent to September 30, 2020 the Company announced a plan to early retire approximately $2.3 billion of outstanding debt securities. The execution of the program is expected to be completed during the three months ended December 31, 2020 and the cash outlay would be funded through a combination of existing liquidity and potentially new debt financing. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements. RECONCILIATION OF MEASURES NOT DEFINED BY U.S. GAAP In accordance with the SEC's Regulation S-K Item 10(e), the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measures. We believe that these measures provide useful perspective on underlying business results and trends (i.e., trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and provide a supplemental measure of year-on-year results. The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measure, but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted. Organic sales growth: Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. This measure is used in assessing achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. Adjusted free cash flow: Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the U.S. Tax Act. Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. Management views adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments. Adjusted free cash flow productivity: Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings. Management views adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G’s ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. This measure is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. The Company's long-term target is to generate annual adjusted free cash flow productivity at or above 90 percent. Core EPS: Core earnings per share, or Core EPS, is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share adjusted as indicated. Management views this non-GAAP measure as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time. This measure is also used when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation. The Core earnings measures included in the following reconciliation tables refer to the equivalent GAAP measures adjusted as applicable for the following items: Incremental Restructuring: The Company has historically had an ongoing level of restructuring activities. Such activities have resulted in ongoing annual restructuring related charges of approximately $250 - $500 million before tax. Since 2012, the Company has had a strategic productivity and cost savings initiative that resulted in incremental restructuring charges. The adjustment to Core earnings includes only the restructuring costs above what we believe are the normal recurring level of restructuring costs. In fiscal 2021 and onwards, the Company expects to incur restructuring costs within our historical ongoing level. We do not view the above item to be part of our sustainable results and its exclusion from Core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results. This item is also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation.

Taylor and Moeller, to allow their timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company’s fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Basis of Presentation These statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of The Procter & Gamble Company and subsidiaries (the ""Company,"" ""Procter & Gamble,"" ""P&G,"" ""we"" or ""our"") contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods reported. However, the results of operations included in such financial statements may not necessarily be indicative of annual results. 2. New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies On July 1, 2019, we adopted ASU 2016-02, ""Leases (Topic 842)."" The new accounting standard requires the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all long-term leases, including operating leases, on the balance sheet. We elected the optional transition method and adopted the new guidance on a modified retrospective basis with no restatement of prior period amounts. As allowed under the new accounting standard, we elected to apply practical expedients to carry forward the original lease determinations, lease classifications and accounting of initial direct costs for all asset classes at the time of adoption. The adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements, resulting in an increase of approximately 1 % to each of our total assets and total liabilities on our balance sheet as of July 1, 2019. See Note 10 for further information. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, ""Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment."" The standard simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by requiring a goodwill impairment to be measured using a single step impairment model, whereby the impairment equals the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the specified reporting units in their entirety. This eliminates the second step of the current impairment model that requires companies to first estimate the fair value of all assets in a reporting unit and measure impairments based on those estimated fair values and a residual measurement approach. It also specifies that any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We will adopt the standard effective July 1, 2020. The impact of the new standard will be dependent on the specific facts and circumstances of future individual impairments, if any. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, ""Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting."" The amendments provide optional guidance for a limited time to ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform. The new guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying U.S. GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The amendments apply only to contracts and hedging relationships that reference LIBOR or another reference rate expected to be discontinued due to reference rate reform. These amendments are effective immediately and may be applied prospectively to contract modifications made and hedging relationships entered into or evaluated on or before December 31, 2022. We are currently evaluating our contracts and the optional expedients provided by the new standard. No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had, or is expected to have, a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 3. Segment Information Under U.S. GAAP, our operating segments are aggregated into five reportable segments: 1) Beauty, 2) Grooming, 3) Health Care, 4) Fabric & Home Care and 5) Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Our five reportable segments are comprised of: • Beauty : Hair Care (Conditioner, Shampoo, Styling Aids, Treatments); Skin and Personal Care (Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Personal Cleansing, Skin Care); • Grooming : Shave Care (Female Blades & Razors, Male Blades & Razors, Pre- and Post-Shave Products, Other Shave Care); Appliances • Health Care : Oral Care (Toothbrushes, Toothpaste, Other Oral Care); Personal Health Care (Gastrointestinal, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements, Pain Relief, Other Personal Health Care); • Fabric & Home Care : Fabric Care (Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Additives, Laundry Detergents); Home Care (Air Care, Dish Care, P&G Professional, Surface Care); and • Baby, Feminine & Family Care : Baby Care (Baby Wipes, Taped Diapers and Pants); Feminine Care (Adult Incontinence, Feminine Care); Family Care (Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper). Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. Our operating segments are comprised of similar product categories. Operating segments that individually accounted for 5% or more of consolidated net sales are as follows: % of Net sales by operating segment (1) Three Months Ended March 31 Nine Months Ended March 31 2020 2019 2020 2019 Fabric Care 23 % 22 % 23 % 23 % Baby Care 11 % 12 % 11 % 12 % Home Care 11 % 11 % 10 % 10 % Skin and Personal Care 9 % 10 % 10 % 10 % Hair Care 9 % 9 % 9 % 9 % Family Care 9 % 8 % 9 % 9 % Oral Care 8 % 8 % 8 % 8 % Shave Care 7 % 8 % 7 % 8 % Feminine Care 7 % 6 % 6 % 6 % Personal Health Care 5 % 5 % 5 % 4 % Other 1 % 1 % 2 % 1 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % (1) % of Net sales by operating segment excludes sales held in Corporate.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill is allocated by reportable segment as follows: Beauty Grooming Health Care Fabric & Home Care Baby, Feminine & Family Care Total Company Goodwill at June 30, 2019 $ 12,985 $ 12,881 $ 7,972 $ 1,855 $ 4,580 $ 40,273 Acquisitions and divestitures ( 1 ) — ( 46 ) — 5 ( 42 ) Translation and other ( 189 ) ( 143 ) ( 201 ) ( 23 ) ( 58 ) ( 614 ) Goodwill at March 31, 2020 $ 12,795 $ 12,738 $ 7,725 $ 1,832 $ 4,527 $ 39,617 Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. Goodwill from current year acquisitions and divestitures primarily reflects opening balance sheet adjustments from the prior year acquisition of the over-the-counter (OTC) healthcare business of Merck KGaA (Merck OTC) in the Health Care reportable segment (see Note 12), along with a minor Baby Care acquisition in the current year and adjustments from a prior year Beauty acquisition. Identifiable intangible assets at March 31, 2020 were comprised of: Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Intangible assets with determinable lives $ 8,458 $ ( 5,628 ) Intangible assets with indefinite lives 21,004 — Total identifiable intangible assets $ 29,462 $ ( 5,628 ) Intangible assets with determinable lives consist of brands, patents, technology and customer relationships. The intangible assets with indefinite lives consist of brands. The amortization expense of determinable lived intangible assets for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 was $ 87 and $ 98 , respectively. For the nine months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, the amortization expense was $ 274 and $ 252 , respectively. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested annually for impairment. The test to evaluate goodwill for impairment is a two-step process. In the first step, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we perform a second step (the step two testing) to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. The step two testing of the impairment analysis requires a valuation of a reporting unit's tangible and intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of purchase price in a business combination. If the resulting implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is less than its carrying value, that difference represents an impairment. The business unit valuations used to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment, margin expansion and Company business plans. We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable. However, future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. Our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets occurs during the three months ended December 31. Most of our goodwill reporting units are comprised of a combination of legacy and acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that, at a minimum, exceed two times their underlying carrying values. Certain of our goodwill reporting units, in particular Shave Care and Appliances, are comprised entirely of acquired businesses and as a result, have fair value cushions that are not as high. The Appliances reporting unit has a fair value that significantly exceeds the underlying carrying value. As previously disclosed, the carrying value of the Shave Care reporting unit and the related Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset were impaired during the quarter ended June 30, 2019. The underlying reductions in fair values were due in large part to significant currency devaluations in a number of countries relative to the U.S. dollar, a deceleration of category growth caused by changing grooming habits, primarily in the developed markets, and an increased competitive market environment in the U.S. and certain other markets. As a result of the June 30, 2019 impairment determined by the step two testing, the Shave Care fair value exceeded the carrying value by approximately 20 % as of June 30, 2019. Because the impairment testing for intangible assets is a one-step process, the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset fair value approximated its carrying value at that date. During our annual impairment testing during the quarter ended December 31, 2019, we reduced the discount rate used in the valuation based on developments in the macroeconomic environment. As a result of this change and updates to other underlying cash flow projections, the Shave Care fair value exceeded the carrying value by more than 20 % and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset fair value exceeded the carrying value by approximately 5 %. The Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is most susceptible to future impairment risk. The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the net sales and earnings growth rates (including residual growth rates) and discount rate. The residual growth rate represents the expected rate at which the reporting unit and Gillette brand are expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period. The residual growth rate utilized in our fair value estimates is consistent with the reporting unit and brand operating plans and approximates expected long term category market growth rates. The residual growth rate is dependent on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, relative currency exchange rates and business activities that impact market share. As a result, the residual growth rate could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes, devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or an increased competitive environment. The discount rate, which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, such as further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar. Spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the U.S. While management can and has implemented strategies to address these events, changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that would trigger future impairment charges of the Shave Care reporting unit's goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. As of March 31, 2020, the carrying values of the Shave Care goodwill and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset were $ 12.4 billion and $ 14.1 billion, respectively. The duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic could result in additional future impairment charges for the Shave Care reporting unit goodwill and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset. While we have concluded that a triggering event did not occur during the quarter ended March 31, 2020, a prolonged pandemic could impact the results of operations due to changes to assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset that are significant enough to trigger an impairment. Net sales and earnings growth rates could be negatively impacted by reductions or changes in demand for our shave care products, which may be caused by, among other things: the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine or other travel restrictions, or financial hardship, or by shifts in demand away from one or more of our higher priced products to lower priced products. In addition, relative global and country/regional macroeconomic factors could result in additional and prolonged devaluation of other countries’ currencies relative to the dollar. Finally, the discount rate utilized in our valuation model could be impacted by changes in the underlying interest rates and risk premiums included in the determination of the cost of capital. The table below provides a sensitivity analysis for the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite lived intangible asset, utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the shorter term and residual growth rates and the discount rate, to demonstrate the potential impacts to the estimated fair values. The table below provides, in isolation, the estimated fair value impacts related to a 25 basis-point increase in the discount rate or a 25 basis-point decrease in our shorter-term and residual growth rates, either of which, in isolation, would result in an additional impairment of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset.

Earnings Per Share Basic net earnings per common share are calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble less preferred dividends by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net earnings per common share are calculated using the treasury stock method, on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of stock options and other stock-based awards and the assumed conversion of preferred stock. Net earnings per share were as follows: CONSOLIDATED AMOUNTS Three Months Ended March 31 Nine Months Ended March 31 2020 2019 2020 2019 Net earnings $ 2,957 $ 2,776 $ 10,317 $ 9,203 Less: Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 40 31 90 65 Net earnings attributable to P&G (Diluted) 2,917 2,745 10,227 9,138 Preferred dividends ( 64 ) ( 64 ) ( 193 ) ( 195 ) Net earnings attributable to P&G available to common shareholders (Basic) $ 2,853 $ 2,681 $ 10,034 $ 8,943 SHARES IN MILLIONS Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 2,476.2 2,509.1 2,489.1 2,501.5 Add: Effect of dilutive securities Conversion of preferred shares (1) 85.5 89.6 86.4 90.8 Impact of stock options and other unvested equity awards (2) 51.6 39.0 54.8 32.0 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 2,613.3 2,637.7 2,630.3 2,624.3 NET EARNINGS PER SHARE (3) Basic $ 1.15 $ 1.07 $ 4.03 $ 3.58 Diluted $ 1.12 $ 1.04 $ 3.89 $ 3.48 (1) Despite being included currently in Diluted net earnings per common share, the actual conversion to common stock occurs when the preferred shares are sold. Shares may only be sold after being allocated to the ESOP participants pursuant to the repayment of the ESOP's obligations through 2035. (2) Weighted average outstanding stock options of approximately 7 million and 4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, and approximately 3 million and 25 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 respectively, were not included in the Diluted net earnings per share calculation because the options were out of the money or to do so would have been antidilutive (i.e., the total proceeds upon exercise would have exceeded the market value of the underlying common shares). (3) Net earnings per share are calculated on Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble. 6. Share-Based Compensation and Postretirement Benefits The following table provides a summary of our share-based compensation expense and postretirement benefit costs: Three Months Ended March 31 Nine Months Ended March 31 2020 2019 2020 2019 Share-based compensation expense $ 123 $ 118 $ 325 $ 299 Net periodic benefit cost for pension benefits (1) 42 30 126 94 Net periodic benefit cost/(credit) for other retiree benefits (1) ( 52 ) ( 41 ) ( 156 ) ( 124 ) (1) The components of the total net periodic benefit cost for both pension benefits and other retiree benefits for these interim periods, on an annualized basis, do not differ materially from the amounts disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. 7. Risk Management Activities and Fair Value Measurements As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. There have been no significant changes in our risk management policies or activities during the nine months ended March 31, 2020. The Company has not changed its valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period. The Company recognizes transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of each quarter. There were no transfers between levels during the periods presented. Also, there was no significant activity within the Level 3 assets and liabilities during the periods presented. There were no significant assets or liabilities that were remeasured at fair value on a non-recurring basis for the nine months ended March 31, 2020. Other investments had a fair value of $ 50 and $ 169 as of March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2019, respectively, and are presented in Other noncurrent assets. During the nine months ended March 31, 2020, the Company sold all of its existing U.S. government securities and corporate bond securities. Such securities were presented in Available-for-sale investment securities at June 30, 2019, and had fair values of $ 3,648 and $ 2,400 , respectively. The Company's investments measured at fair value are generally classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Cash equivalents were $ 14,171 and $ 2,956 as of March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2019, respectively, and are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. There are no other material investment balances classified as Level 1 or Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy or using net asset value as a practical expedient. Fair values are generally estimated based upon quoted market prices for similar instruments. The fair value of long-term debt was $ 28,602 and $ 25,378 as of March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2019, respectively. This includes the current portion of long-term debt instruments ($ 3,473 and $ 3,390 as of March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2019, respectively). Certain long-term debt (debt designated as a fair value hedge) is recorded at fair value. All other long-term debt is recorded at amortized cost but is measured at fair value for disclosure purposes. We consider our debt to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Fair values are generally estimated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments. Disclosures about Financial Instruments The notional amounts and fair values of financial instruments used in hedging transactions as of March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2019 are as follows: Notional Amount Fair Value Asset Fair Value (Liability) March 31, 2020 June 30, 2019 March 31, 2020 June 30, 2019 March 31, 2020 June 30, 2019 DERIVATIVES IN FAIR VALUE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Interest rate contracts $ 7,015 $ 7,721 $ 232 $ 177 $ — $ ( 1 ) DERIVATIVES IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Foreign currency interest rate contracts $ 3,279 $ 3,157 $ 69 $ 35 $ ( 10 ) $ ( 24 ) TOTAL DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS $ 10,294 $ 10,878 $ 301 $ 212 $ ( 10 ) $ ( 25 ) DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS Foreign currency contracts $ 6,001 $ 6,431 $ 47 $ 27 $ ( 76 ) $ ( 20 ) TOTAL DERIVATIVES AT FAIR VALUE $ 16,295 $ 17,309 $ 348 $ 239 $ ( 86 ) $ ( 45 ) All derivative assets are presented in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Other noncurrent assets. All derivative liabilities are presented in Accrued and other liabilities or Other noncurrent liabilities. The fair value of the interest rate derivative asset/(liability) directly offsets the cumulative amount of the fair value hedging adjustment included in the carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation. The carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation, which includes the unamortized discount or premium and the fair value adjustment, was $ 7,217 and $ 7,860 as of March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2019, respectively. In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges. The carrying value of those debt instruments designated as net investment hedges, which includes the adjustment for the foreign currency transaction gain or loss on those instruments, was $ 16,765 and $ 17,154 as of March 31, 2020 and June 30, 2019, respectively. Changes in the fair value of net investment hedges are recognized in the Foreign currency translation component of Other comprehensive income (OCI). All of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. Before tax gains/(losses) on our financial instruments in hedging relationships are categorized as follows: Amount of Gain/(Loss) Recognized in OCI on Derivatives Three Months Ended March 31 Nine Months Ended March 31 2020 2019 2020 2019 DERIVATIVES IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS (1) (2) Foreign exchange contracts $ 83 $ 34 $ 114 $ 53 (1) For the derivatives in net investment hedging relationships, the amount of gain/(loss) excluded from effectiveness testing, which was recognized in earnings, was $ 17 and $ 17 for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The amount of gain/(loss) excluded from effectiveness testing was $ 57 and $ 44 for the nine months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. (2) In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges. The amount of gain/(loss) recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (AOCI) for such instruments was $ 306 and $ 226 for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The amount of gain/(loss) recognized in AOCI for such instruments was $ 487 and $ 467 for the nine months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Amount of Gain/(Loss) Recognized in Earnings Three Months Ended March 31 Nine Months Ended March 31 2020 2019 2020 2019 DERIVATIVES IN FAIR VALUE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Interest rate contracts $ 109 $ 21 $ 56 $ 39 DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS Foreign currency contracts $ ( 148 ) $ 75 $ ( 160 ) $ 68 The gain/(loss) on the derivatives in fair value hedging relationships is fully offset by the mark-to-market impact of the related exposure. These are both recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in Interest expense. The gain/(loss) on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is substantially offset by the currency mark-to-market of the related exposure. These are both recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A). 8. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss) The table below presents the changes in AOCI, including the reclassifications out of AOCI by component: Investment Securities Pension and Other Retiree Benefits Foreign Currency Translation Total AOCI Balance at June 30, 2019 $ 11 $ ( 4,198 ) $ ( 10,749 ) $ ( 14,936 ) OCI before reclassifications (1) ( 10 ) 104 ( 1,312 ) ( 1,218 ) Amounts reclassified from AOCI into the Consolidated Statements of Earnings (2) ( 2 ) 223 — 221 Net current period OCI ( 12 ) 327 ( 1,312 ) ( 997 ) Less: Other comprehensive income/(loss) attributable to non-controlling interests — — ( 17 ) ( 17 ) Balance at March 31, 2020 $ ( 1 ) $ ( 3,871 ) $ ( 12,044 ) $ ( 15,916 ) (1) Net of tax expense/(benefit) of $( 2 ), $ 51 and $ 141 for gains/losses on investment securities, pension and other retiree benefit items and foreign currency translation, respectively. (2) Net of tax expense/(benefit) of $ 0 , $ 66 and $ 0 for gains/losses on investment securities, pension and other retiree benefit items and foreign currency translation, respectively. The below provides additional details on amounts reclassified from AOCI into the Consolidated Statements of Earnings: • Investment securities: amounts reclassified from AOCI into Other non-operating income, net. • Pension and other retiree benefits: amounts reclassified from AOCI into Other non-operating income, net and included in the computation of net periodic postretirement costs. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. 9. Restructuring Program The Company has historically incurred an ongoing annual level of restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Before-tax costs incurred under the ongoing program have generally ranged from $ 250 to $ 500 annually. In fiscal 2017 the Company announced specific elements of a multi-year productivity and cost savings plan to further reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, certain marketing activities and overhead expenses. This program is expected to result in incremental targeted enrollment reductions, along with further optimization of the supply chain and other manufacturing processes. Restructuring costs incurred consist primarily of costs to separate employees, asset-related costs to exit facilities and other costs. For the three and nine month period ended March 31, 2020, the Company incurred total restructuring charges of $ 222 and $ 420 , respectively. Of these charges incurred, approximately $ 198 and $ 331 were recorded in Cost of products sold and approximately $ 21 and $ 80 were recorded in SG&A, respectively. The remainder of these charges were recorded in Other non-operating income, net. The following table presents restructuring activity for the nine months ended March 31, 2020: Reserve Balance Charges Previously Reported (Six Months Ended December 31, 2019) Charges for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2020 Nine Months Ended March 31, 2020 Reserve Balance June 30, 2019 Cash Spent Charges Against Assets March 31, 2020 Separations $ 280 $ 81 $ 41 $ ( 170 ) $ — $ 232 Asset-related costs — 73 148 — ( 221 ) — Other costs 188 44 33 ( 107 ) — 158 Total $ 468 $ 198 $ 222 $ ( 277 ) $ ( 221 ) $ 390 Separation Costs Employee separation charges for the three and nine month period ended March 31, 2020 relate to severance packages for approximately 350 and 720 employees, respectively. The packages were primarily voluntary and the amounts were calculated based on salary levels and past service periods. Severance costs related to voluntary separations are generally charged to earnings when the employee accepts the offer. Asset-Related Costs Asset-related costs consist of both asset write-downs and accelerated depreciation. Asset write-downs relate to the establishment of a new fair value basis for assets held-for-sale or disposal. These assets were written down to the lower of their current carrying basis or amounts expected to be realized upon disposal, less minor disposal costs. Charges for accelerated depreciation relate to long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period. These assets relate primarily to manufacturing consolidations and technology standardizations. The asset-related charges will not have a significant impact on future depreciation charges. Other Costs Other restructuring-type charges are incurred as a direct result of the restructuring program. Such charges primarily include asset removal and termination of contracts related to supply chain optimization. Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the restructuring program charges are funded by and included within Corporate for both management and segment reporting. Accordingly, all of the charges under the program are included within the Corporate reportable segment. However, for informative purposes, the following table summarizes the total restructuring costs related to our reportable segments: Three Months Ended March 31, 2020 Nine Months Ended March 31, 2020 Beauty $ 16 $ 29 Grooming 20 52 Health Care 65 89 Fabric & Home Care 6 17 Baby, Feminine & Family Care 63 92 Corporate (1) 52 141 Total Company $ 222 $ 420 (1) Corporate includes costs related to allocated overheads, including charges related to our Market Operations, Global Business Services and Corporate Functions activities. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. 10. Leases The Company determines whether a contract contains a lease at the inception of a contract by determining if the contract conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. We lease certain real estate, machinery, equipment, vehicles and office equipment for varying periods. Many of these leases include an option to either renew or terminate the lease. For purposes of calculating lease liabilities, these options are included within the lease term when it has become reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options. The incremental borrowing rate utilized to calculate our lease liabilities is based on the information available at commencement date, as most of the leases do not provide an implicit borrowing rate. The Company does not have any material financing lease or sublease activities. The Company incurred lease expense for operating leases of $ 82 and $ 255 for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2020, respectively. Total cash paid related to leases during the three and nine months ended March 31, 2020 was $ 60 and $ 205 , respectively, including amounts expensed and amounts capitalized. Short-term leases, defined as leases with initial terms of 12 months or less, are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Lease expense for such short-term leases is not material. The most significant assets in our leasing portfolio relate to real estate and vehicles. For purposes of calculating lease liabilities for such leases, we have combined lease and non-lease components. The right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new lease liabilities were $ 42 and $ 70 for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2020, respectively. Supplemental balance sheet and other information related to leases is as follows: March 31, 2020 Operating leases: Other noncurrent assets $ 855 Accrued and other liabilities 245 Other noncurrent liabilities 645 Total operating lease liabilities $ 890 Weighted average remaining lease term: Operating leases 6.4 years Weighted average discount rate: Operating leases 4.4 % At March 31, 2020, future payments of operating lease liabilities were as follows: Operating Leases March 31, 2020 1 year $ 245 2 years 193 3 years 159 4 years 134 5 years 93 Over 5 years 199 Total lease payments 1,023 Less: Interest ( 133 ) Present value of lease liabilities $ 890 Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. As of June 30, 2019, minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases by fiscal year were expected to be: Operating Leases June 30, 2019 2020 $ 263 2021 209 2022 165 2023 141 2024 121 After 2024 244 Total lease payments $ 1,143 11. Commitments and Contingencies Litigation We are subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental, patent and trademark matters, labor and employment matters and tax. While considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management and our counsel, the ultimate resolution of the various lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior manufacturing and waste disposal practices. Based on currently available information, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of environmental remediation will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Income Tax Uncertainties The Company is present in approximately 70 countries and over 150 taxable jurisdictions and, at any point in time, has 40 – 50 jurisdictional audits underway at various stages of completion. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite our belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitations. Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate. We have tax years open ranging from 2008 and forward. We are generally not able to reliably estimate the ultimate settlement amounts until the close of the audit. Based on information currently available, we anticipate that over the next 12 month period, audit activity could be completed related to uncertain tax positions in multiple jurisdictions for which we have accrued existing liabilities of approximately $ 50 , including interest and penalties. Additional information on the Commitments and Contingencies of the Company can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2019. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. 12. Merck Acquisition On November 30, 2018, we completed our acquisition of the OTC healthcare business of Merck KGaA (Merck OTC) for $ 3.7 billion (based on exchange rates at the time of closing) in an all-cash transaction. This business primarily sells OTC consumer healthcare products, mainly in Europe, Latin America and Asia markets. The results of Merck OTC, which are not material to the Company, are reported in our consolidated financial statements beginning December 1, 2018. During the quarter ended December 31, 2019, we completed the allocation of the purchase price to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The allocation is based on the final determination of fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired. The following table presents the allocation of purchase price related to the Merck OTC business as of the date of the acquisition: Amounts in millions November 30, 2018 Current assets $ 421 Property, plant and equipment 119 Intangible assets 2,134 Goodwill 2,083 Other non-current assets 209 Total assets acquired $ 4,966 Current liabilities $ 232 Deferred income taxes 763 Non-current liabilities 94 Total liabilities acquired $ 1,089 Noncontrolling interest (1) $ 169 Net assets acquired $ 3,708 (1) Represents a 48 % minority ownership interest in the Merck India company. The acquisition resulted in $ 2.1 billion in goodwill, of which approximately $ 180 million is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. All of this goodwill was allocated to the Health Care reportable segment. The fair value of Merck OTC’s identifiable intangible assets is $ 2.1 billion. The allocation of identifiable intangible assets and their average useful lives is as follows: Amounts in millions Estimated Fair Value Avg Remaining Useful Life Intangible assets with determinable lives Brands $ 701 14 Patents and technology 162 10 Customer relationships 325 20 Total $ 1,188 15 Intangible assets with indefinite lives Brands 946 Total intangible assets $ 2,134 The majority of the acquired intangible assets relate to brand intangibles. Our assessment as to brand intangibles that have an indefinite life and those that have a definite life was based on a number of factors, including competitive environment, market share, brand history, product life cycles, operating plan and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. The indefinite-lived brand intangibles include Neurobion and Dolo Neurobion. The definite-lived brand intangibles primarily include regional or local brands. The definite-lived brand intangibles have estimated lives ranging from 10 to 20 years. The technology intangibles are related to R&D and manufacturing know-how. The customer relationships intangibles are related to Merck OTC’s relationships with health care professionals, retailers and distributors. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements Certain statements in this report, other than purely historical information, including estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives, and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements are based, are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected herein, is included in the section titled ""Economic Conditions and Uncertainties"" and the section titled ""Risk Factors"" (Part II, Item 1A) of this Form 10-Q. The purpose of Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is to provide an understanding of Procter & Gamble's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. The MD&A is organized in the following sections: • Overview • Summary of Results – Nine Months Ended March 31, 2020 • Economic Conditions and Uncertainties • Results of Operations – Three and Nine Months Ended March 31, 2020 • Business Segment Discussion – Three and Nine Months Ended March 31, 2020 • Liquidity and Capital Resources • Reconciliation of Measures Not Defined by U.S. GAAP Throughout the MD&A, we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales and net earnings. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), consisting of organic sales growth, core net earnings per share (Core EPS), adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity. The explanation at the end of the MD&A provides the definition of these non-GAAP measures, details on the use and the derivation of these measures, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures. Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and market consumption in the MD&A are based on a combination of vendor purchased traditional brick-and-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales of our products in dollar terms on a constant currency basis, relative to all product sales in the category. The Company measures fiscal year to date market shares through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months as compared to the end of the reporting period. Management also uses unit volume growth to evaluate and explain drivers of changes in net sales. Organic volume growth reflects year-over-year changes in unit volume excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and certain one-time items if applicable and is used to explain changes in organic sales. OVERVIEW P&G is a global leader in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories, primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, high-frequency stores and pharmacies. We also sell direct to consumers. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries. Our market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands.

The following table provides the percentage of net sales and net earnings by reportable business segment for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2020 (excluding net sales and net earnings in Corporate): Three Months Ended March 31, 2020 Nine Months Ended March 31, 2020 Net Sales Net Earnings Net Sales Net Earnings Beauty 18% 15% 19% 22% Grooming 8% 9% 9% 10% Health Care 13% 14% 13% 14% Fabric & Home Care 34% 33% 33% 29% Baby, Feminine & Family Care 27% 29% 26% 25% Total Company 100% 100% 100% 100% SUMMARY OF RESULTS Following are highlights of results for the nine months ended March 31, 2020 versus the nine months ended March 31, 2019: • Net sales increased 5% to $53.3 billion, driven by a double digit increase in Health Care, mid-single digits increases in Beauty and Fabric & Home Care and a low single digits increase in Baby, Feminine & Family Care, partially offset by a low single digits decrease in Grooming. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, increased 6%, driven by high single digits increase in Health Care and Fabric & Home Care, mid-single digits increases in Beauty and Baby, Feminine & Family Care and low single digits increases in Grooming. • Unit volume increased 5% , with organic volume up 4%. Volume increased double digits in Health Care, mid-single digits in Fabric & Home Care and low single digits in Beauty and in Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Grooming volume was unchanged. Excluding the impacts of the Merck OTC acquisition, organic volume increased high single digits in Health Care. • Net earnings were $10.3 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion or 12% versus the prior year period due to the increase in net sales, an increase in operating margin and a reduction in the current period income tax rate, partially offset by the base period gain on the dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership. • Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $1.1 billion or 12% versus the prior year period to $10.2 billion . • Diluted net earnings per share increased 12% to $3.89 due primarily to the increase in net earnings. • Core net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble, which represents net earnings excluding incremental restructuring charges in both periods and the base period gain on the dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership, increased 16% to $10.4 billion. Core net earnings per share increased 16% to $3.96 due primarily to the increase in Core net earnings. • Operating cash flow was $12.6 billion. Adjusted free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less capital expenditures and certain other impacts, was $10.4 billion. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 101%. ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES Global Economic Conditions . Our products are sold in numerous countries across North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa with more than half our sales generated outside the United States. As such, we are exposed to and impacted by global macroeconomic factors, U.S. and foreign government policies and foreign exchange fluctuations. Current global economic conditions are highly volatile due to the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting in both market size contractions in certain countries due to economic slowdowns and government restrictions on movement, as well as market size increases in certain countries due to pantry loading and increased consumption of household cleaning and personal health and hygiene products by consumers. Other macroeconomic factors also remain dynamic, and any causes of market size contraction, such as reduced GDP in commodity-dependent economies, greater political unrest or instability in the Middle East, Central & Eastern Europe, certain Latin American markets, the Hong Kong market in Greater China and the Korean peninsula, economic uncertainty related to the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, and overall economic slowdowns, could reduce our sales or erode our operating margin, in either case reducing our earnings. Changes in Costs . Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, transportation costs and our own productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities, in particular, certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp, and volatility in the market price of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs. Disruptions in our manufacturing, supply and distribution operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic may also impact our costs. If we are unable to manage these impacts through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions, as well as through consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our gross margin, operating margin and net earnings. Sales could also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on consumption of our products. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including outsourcing projects, supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. As discussed later in this MD&A, in 2012 we initiated overhead and supply chain cost improvement projects. In fiscal 2017, we communicated specific elements of an additional multi-year cost reduction program which is resulting in targeted enrollment reductions and other savings. If we are not successful in executing and sustaining these changes, there could be a negative impact on our operating margin and net earnings. Foreign Exchange . We have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates. Translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation of transaction-related working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. In four of the past five fiscal years, as well as the current year, the U.S. dollar has strengthened versus a number of foreign currencies, leading to lower sales and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts. Certain countries experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations, like Argentina, Brazil, Greater China, Turkey and the United Kingdom have previously had, and could in the future have, a significant impact on our sales, costs and earnings. Increased pricing in response to certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could also have a negative impact on consumption of our products, which would affect our sales and profits. Government Policies . Our net earnings could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government tax policies, for example, the U.S. Tax Act enacted in December 2017, and the current work being led by the OECD for the G20 focused on ""Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy."" The breadth of this project extends beyond pure digital businesses and is likely to impact all multinational businesses by redefining jurisdictional taxing rights. Further, our earnings and sales may be impacted by U.S. and foreign government policies to manage the COVID-19 pandemic, such as movement restrictions or site closures. Additionally, we attempt to carefully manage our debt, currency and other exposures in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and pricing controls, such as Nigeria, Algeria, Egypt, Argentina and Turkey. Further, our earnings and sales could be affected by changes to international trade agreements in North America and elsewhere, including increases of import tariffs, both currently effective and potential future changes. Changes in government policies in these areas might cause an increase or decrease in our sales, operating margin and net earnings. For information on risk factors that could impact our results, please refer to “Risk Factors” in Part II, Item 1A of this Form 10-Q. COVID-19 Pandemic disclosures The Company’s priorities during the COVID-19 pandemic are protecting the health and safety of our employees; maximizing the availability of products that help consumers with their health, hygiene and cleaning needs; and the use of our employees’ talents and our resources to help society meet and overcome the current challenges. Because the Company sells products that are essential to the daily lives of consumers, the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material net impact to our consolidated operating results in the current quarter. However, the pandemic has had offsetting impacts during the period. For example, during the quarter ended March 31, 2020 we experienced a significant increase in demand and consumption of certain of our product categories in certain markets (the health, hygiene and cleaning products, and primarily in North America and Europe) caused in part by changing consumer habits and pantry stocking, contributing to increases in net sales. At the same time, we experienced declines in Greater China, Japan, and in certain channels, including travel retail, due to the economic slowdown and restricted consumer movements, as well as in certain of our beauty and grooming products. In the future, the pandemic may cause reduced demand for our products if it results in a recessionary global economic environment. It could also lead to volatility in consumer access to our products due to government actions impacting our ability to produce and ship products or impacting consumers’ movements and access to our products. We believe that over the long term, there will continue to be strong demand for categories in which we operate, particularly our products that deliver essential health, hygiene and cleaning benefits. However, the timing and extent of demand recovery in markets such as Greater China and Japan, the resumption of international travel, the timing and impact of potential consumer pantry destocking in markets including North America and Europe, and product demand trends caused by future economic trends are unclear. Accordingly, there may be heightened volatility in net sales and resulting earnings during and subsequent to the duration of the pandemic. Our retail customers are also being impacted by the pandemic. Their success in addressing the issues and maintaining their operations could impact consumer access to, and as a result, sales of our products. Our ability to continue to operate without any significant negative impacts will in part depend on our ability to protect our employees and our supply chain. The Company has endeavored to follow recommended actions of government and health authorities to protect our employees world-wide, with particular measures in place for those working in our plants and distribution facilities. We have also worked closely with local and national officials to keep our manufacturing facilities open due to the essential nature of our products. For the three months ended March 31, 2020, we were able to broadly maintain our operations. We intend to continue to work with government authorities and implement our employee safety measures to ensure that we are able to continue manufacturing and distributing our products during the pandemic. However, uncertainty resulting from the pandemic could result in an unforeseen disruption to our supply chain (for example a closure of a key manufacturing or distribution facility or the inability of a key supplier or transportation supplier to source and transport materials) that could impact our operations. Because the pandemic has not materially impacted our operations or demand for our products, it has also not negatively impacted the Company’s liquidity position. We continue to generate operating cash flows to meet our short-term liquidity needs, and we expect to maintain access to the capital markets enabled by our strong short- and long-term debt ratings. We have also not observed any material impairments of our assets or a significant change in the fair value of assets due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Three Months Ended March 31, 2020 The following discussion provides a review of results for the three months ended March 31, 2020 versus the three months ended March 31, 2019. Three Months Ended March 31 Amounts in millions, except per share amounts 2020 2019 % Chg Net sales $17,214 $16,462 5% Operating income 3,453 3,229 7% Net earnings 2,957 2,776 7% Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 2,917 2,745 6% Diluted net earnings per common share 1.12 1.04 8% Core net earnings per common share 1.17 1.06 10% Three Months Ended March 31 COMPARISONS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES 2020 2019 Basis Pt Chg Gross margin 49.4% 48.8% 60 Selling, general & administrative expense 29.3% 29.2% 10 Operating income 20.1% 19.6% 50 Earnings before income taxes 20.3% 19.9% 40 Net earnings 17.2% 16.9% 30 Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 16.9% 16.7% 20 Net Sales Net sales for the quarter increased 5% to $17.2 billion including a 2% negative impact from foreign exchange. Unit volume increased 6%. Excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures, organic volume also increased 6%. Increased pricing had a 1% positive impact to net sales. Mix had no impact to net sales. Volume increased high single digits in Heath Care, Fabric & Home Care and in Baby, Feminine & Family Care, and increased low single digits in Beauty. Grooming volume was unchanged. On a regional basis, volume increased double digits in North America and high single digits in Europe driven by innovation, increased demand and market growth, particularly in household cleaning and personal health and hygiene products due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic. Volume increased mid-single digits in Asia Pacific and Latin America. These increases were partially offset by a double digits volume decrease in Greater China due to market contraction driven by economic slowdown resulting from COVD-19 and a low single digits decrease in India, Middle East and Africa (IMEA). Organic sales increased 6% on a 6% increase in organic volume.

(2) Other includes the sales mix impact from acquisitions and divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile volume to net sales. Operating Costs Gross margin increased 60 basis points to 49.4% of net sales for the quarter. Gross margin benefited from: • 170 basis points of gross manufacturing cost savings projects (150 basis points net of product and packaging reinvestments), • 100 basis points of lower commodity costs, and • 40 basis points of positive pricing impacts These benefits were partially offset by a 160 basis point decline from unfavorable mix (due to the disproportionate growth of Fabric & Home Care and Baby, Feminine & Family Care segments which have lower than company average margins, as well as mix within segments due to the growth of lower margin product forms and large sizes in certain categories), a 60 basis-point decline from higher restructuring costs and a 10 basis-point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange. Total SG&A spending increased 5% to $5.0 billion primarily due to increases in marketing spending and other operating costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased 10 basis points to 29.3% due to an increase in marketing spending and other net operating costs as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by a reduction in overhead costs as a percentage of net sales. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales increased 40 basis points as the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and savings in agency compensation, production costs and advertising spending were more than offset by reinvestments in media. Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales declined 50 basis points due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and productivity savings, partially offset by inflation and other cost increases. Other net operating costs as a percentage of net sales increased 30 basis points primarily due to an increase in foreign exchange transaction charges. Productivity-driven cost savings delivered 70 basis points of benefit to SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Non-Operating Expenses and Income Interest expense was $100 million for the quarter, a decrease of $31 million versus the prior year period due to a decrease in average debt balances and a reduction in U.S. interest rates. Interest income was $39 million for the quarter, a $13 million decrease versus the prior year period due to lower average cash and investment securities balances and reduced U.S. interest rates. Other non-operating income was $106 million, a decrease of $22 million due to higher costs on certain postretirement benefit plans in the current period. Income Taxes For the three months ended March 31, 2020, the effective tax rate increased 20 basis points versus the prior year period to 15.5%. A 290 basis-point increase from an unfavorable geographic mix of earnings, caused primarily by disproportionately higher sales and earnings in the U.S. was partially offset by: • a 150 basis-point reduction from a non-recurring tax benefit arising from a simplification of our legal entity structure, • a 70 basis-point reduction from discrete impacts related to uncertain tax positions (30 basis-point reduction in the current period versus 40 basis-point increase in the prior year period) and • a 40 basis-point reduction from increased excess tax benefits of share-based compensation (280 basis-point reduction in the current period versus 240 basis-point reduction in the prior year period). Net Earnings Operating income increased $224 million, or 7% to $3.5 billion for the quarter, due to the net sales increase and the increase in gross margin, partially offset by the increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales, all of which are described above. Net earnings increased $181 million or 7% to $3 billion due to the increase in operating income. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of approximately $144 million on net earnings for the quarter, including both transactional charges and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars. Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $172 million or 6% to $2.9 billion for the quarter. Diluted net earnings per share increased 8% to $1.12. Core net earnings per share increased 10% to $1.17. Core net earnings per share represents diluted net earnings per share, excluding the incremental restructuring charges in both periods related to our productivity and cost savings plans. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Nine Months Ended March 31, 2020 The following discussion provides a review of results for the nine months ended March 31, 2020 versus the nine months ended March 31, 2019. Nine Months Ended March 31 Amounts in millions, except per share amounts 2020 2019 % Chg Net sales $53,252 $50,590 5% Operating income 12,225 10,679 14% Net earnings 10,317 9,203 12% Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 10,227 9,138 12% Diluted net earnings per common share 3.89 3.48 12% Core net earnings per common share 3.96 3.42 16% Nine Months Ended March 31 COMPARISONS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES 2020 2019 Basis Pt Chg Gross margin 50.6% 48.9% 170 Selling, general & administrative expense 27.6% 27.8% (20) Operating income 23.0% 21.1% 190 Earnings before income taxes 23.2% 22.0% 120 Net earnings 19.4% 18.2% 120 Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 19.2% 18.1% 110 Net Sales Net sales for the nine months ended March 31, 2020 increased 5% to $53.3 billion including a 2% negative impact from foreign exchange. Unit volume increased 5%. Excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures, organic volume increased 4%. Increased pricing had a 1% favorable impact to net sales. Mix was a 1% positive impact to net sales, driven primarily by disproportionate organic growth of the Health Care segment and the Skin & Personal Care category, both of which have higher than company average selling prices. Volume increased double digits in Health Care, increased mid-single digits in Fabric & Home Care and increased low single digits in Beauty and in Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Volume was unchanged in Grooming. Excluding the impacts of the Merck OTC acquisition, Health Care organic volume increased high single digits. On a regional basis volume grew mid-single digits in North America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Latin America and grew low single digits in IMEA. Excluding the impact of minor acquisitions and divestitures, organic volume increased low single digits in Latin America. Organic sales increased 6% on a 4% increase in organic volume.

Operating Costs Gross margin increased 170 basis points to 50.6% of net sales for the nine months ended March 31, 2020. Gross margin benefited from: • 130 basis points of gross manufacturing cost savings projects (110 basis points net of product and packaging reinvestments), • 50 basis points of positive pricing impacts, and • 70 basis points of lower commodity costs These benefits were partially offset by a 10 basis-point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange and a 50 basis point net decline from unfavorable product mix (primarily mix within segments due to the growth of lower margin product forms and large sizes in certain categories) and other impacts. Total SG&A spending increased 5% to $14.7 billion for the nine months ended March 31, 2020, primarily due to increases in marketing spending and to a lesser extent overhead costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 20 basis points to 27.6% due to a decrease in overhead and other operating costs as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by an increase in marketing spending as a percentage of sales. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales increased 10 basis points as the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and savings in agency compensation, production costs and advertising spending, were more than offset by reinvestments in media and other marketing spending. Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points driven by the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase, productivity savings and lower restructuring charges versus the base period, partially offset by inflation, higher incentive compensation costs and other cost increases. Other net operating costs as a percentage of net sales decreased 10 basis points primarily due to gains from legal settlements, partially offset by an increase in foreign exchange transaction charges. Productivity-driven cost savings delivered 80 basis points of benefit to SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Non-Operating Expenses and Income Interest expense was $308 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2020, a decrease of $90 million versus the prior year period due to a decrease in average debt balances and a reduction in U.S. interest rates. Interest income was $133 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2020, a decrease of $35 million versus the prior year period due to a decrease in cash and investment securities balances and a reduction in U.S. interest rates. Other non-operating income was $323 million, a decrease of $362 million primarily due to the base period gain from the dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership. Income Taxes For the nine months ended March 31, 2020, the effective tax rate decreased 70 basis points versus the prior year period to 16.6% due to: • a 130 basis-point reduction from a non-recurring tax benefit arising from a simplification of our legal entity structure and • a 40 basis-point reduction from increased excess tax benefits of share-based compensation (a 180 basis-point reduction in the current year versus a 140 basis-point reduction in the prior year). These reductions are partially offset by: • a 60 basis-point increase related to the prior year tax impact of the gain on the dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership and • a 30 basis-point increase from unfavorable geographic mix of earnings. Net Earnings Operating income increased $1.5 billion, or 14% to $12.2 billion for the nine months ended March 31, 2020, due to the net sales increase, the increase in gross margin and the reduction in SG&A as a percentage of sales, all of which are described above. Net earnings increased $1.1 billion or 12% to $10.3 billion for the fiscal year to date period due to the increase in operating income and the lower tax rates as described above, partially offset by the base period gain on the PGT Healthcare partnership dissolution. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of approximately $234 million on net earnings for the fiscal year to date period, including both transactional charges and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars. Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $1.1 billion or 12% to $10.2 billion for the fiscal year to date period. Diluted net earnings per share increased 12% to $3.89. Core net earnings per share increased 16% to $3.96. Core net earnings per share represents diluted net earnings per share excluding the incremental restructuring charges in both periods related to our productivity and cost savings plans and the gain on dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership in the base period. BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSION – Three and Nine Months Ended March 31, 2020 The following discussion provides a review of results by reportable business segment. Analysis of the results for the three and nine month periods ended March 31, 2020 is provided based on a comparison to the same three and nine months periods ended March 31, 2019. The primary financial measures used to evaluate segment performance are net sales and net earnings. The table below provides supplemental information on net sales and net earnings by reportable business segment for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2020 versus the comparable prior year periods (dollar amounts in millions): Three Months Ended March 31, 2020 Net Sales % Change Versus Year Ago Earnings/(Loss) Before Income Taxes % Change Versus Year Ago Net Earnings % Change Versus Year Ago Beauty $ 3,033 (1) % $ 553 (18) % $ 436 (21) % Grooming 1,380 (3) % 305 (7) % 254 (26) % Health Care 2,262 7 % 523 13 % 408 14 % Fabric & Home Care 5,826 8 % 1,271 14 % 957 13 % Baby, Feminine & Family Care 4,597 6 % 1,130 31 % 859 32 % Corporate 116 N/A (284) N/A 43 N/A Total Company $ 17,214 5 % $ 3,498 7 % $ 2,957 7 % Nine Months Ended March 31, 2020 Net Sales % Change Versus Year Ago Earnings/(Loss) Before Income Taxes % Change Versus Year Ago Net Earnings % Change Versus Year Ago Beauty $ 10,183 5 % $ 2,717 5 % $ 2,168 4 % Grooming 4,559 (1) % 1,225 3 % 1,018 (4) % Health Care 7,013 13 % 1,795 14 % 1,380 14 % Fabric & Home Care 17,445 6 % 3,887 15 % 2,960 15 % Baby, Feminine & Family Care 13,746 3 % 3,340 24 % 2,552 24 % Corporate 306 N/A (591) N/A 239 N/A Total Company $ 53,252 5 % $ 12,373 11 % $ 10,317 12 % Beauty Three months ended March 31, 2020 compared with three months ended March 31, 2019 Beauty net sales decreased 1% to $3.0 billion during the third fiscal quarter on a 1% increase in unit volume. Unfavorable product mix reduced net sales by 2% driven by the disproportionate decline of the super premium SKII brand, caused by the impacts of the COVD-19 pandemic related travel restrictions and economic downturns in Greater China and certain markets in Asia. Higher pricing increased net sales by 2%. Unfavorable foreign exchange impacts reduced net sales by 2%. Organic sales increased 1%. Global market share of the Beauty segment increased 0.2 points. The volume increase was driven by a double digit increase in Europe, a high single digit increase in Asia Pacific and a mid-single digit increase in North America, partially offset by a double digit decrease in Greater China (primarily due to reduced demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic) and in IMEA. • Volume in Hair Care decreased low single digits. The volume decrease was driven by a high teens decline in Greater China (due to the aforementioned negative impacts of COVID-19), a double digit decline in IMEA and a mid-single digits decline in North America (both due to market declines in certain countries). This was partially offset by a double digit volume increase in Europe and high single digit increase in Asia Pacific due to innovation. Global market share of the Hair Care category was unchanged. • Volume in Skin and Personal Care increased high single digits, primarily driven by growth in personal care products. Volume grew double digits in North America, high single digits in Europe and Asia Pacific and mid-single digits in Greater China (all due to innovation, increased marketing spending and increased consumption and pantry loading due to the COVID-19 pandemic). Global market share of the Skin and Personal Care category increased less than half a point. Net earnings decreased 21% to $436 million due to the decrease in net sales and a 360 basis-point decrease in net earnings margin. The net earnings margin decreased due to a reduction in gross margin, an increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales and an increase in effective tax rates due to unfavorable geographic mix of earnings. The gross margin decrease was primarily driven by the negative impacts of unfavorable mix, due to the disproportionate decline of the super-premium SKII brand, partially offset by increased pricing. The increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to the negative scale impacts of the net sales decrease and increased marketing spending. Nine months ended March 31, 2020 compared with nine months ended March 31, 2019 Beauty fiscal year to date net sales increased 5% to $10.2 billion on a 3% increase in unit volume. Favorable product mix added 1% to net sales due to the disproportionate growth of the Skin and Personal Care category, including the Olay Skin care brand, which has higher than segment average selling prices. Higher pricing increased net sales by 2%. Unfavorable foreign exchange impacts reduced net sales by 2%. Organic sales increased 6%. Global market share of the Beauty segment increased 0.1 points. Volume grew high single digits in Europe, mid-single digits in Asia Pacific and low single digits in North America, Greater China and Latin America, partially offset by low single digit decrease in IMEA. • Volume in Hair Care increased low single digits. Increased volume was driven by high single digits growth in Europe, mid-single digits growth in Asia Pacific and low single digits growth in Latin America due to product innovation and market growth, partially offset by a mid-single digit decline in Greater China (due to the aforementioned impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic) and a low single digit decline in IMEA (due to market decline in certain countries). Volume in North America was unchanged. Excluding the impact of minor acquisitions, organic volume in North America decreased low single digits due to market decline. Global market share of the Hair Care category was unchanged. • Volume in Skin and Personal Care increased high single digits. Excluding the impact of minor brand acquisitions, organic volume increased mid-single digits. Volume growth was driven by a double digit increase in Greater China and mid-single digits increases in North America, Europe, Latin America and Asia Pacific. Volume growth was driven by innovation, increased marketing spending, market growth and to a lesser extent increased consumption and pantry loading in the most recent quarter due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Global market share of the Skin and Personal Care category increased less than half a point. Net earnings increased 4% to $2.2 billion due to the increase in net sales, partially offset by a 10 basis-point decrease in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin decreased marginally due to a reduction in gross margin, offset by a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. The gross margin decrease was primarily driven by the negative impacts of unfavorable mix (due to the lower relative growth of the SK-II brand and the disproportionate growth of large sizes) and other hurts related to new manufacturing startup costs, partially offset by increased pricing. The reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase. Grooming Three months ended March 31, 2020 compared with three months ended March 31, 2019 Grooming net sales decreased 3% to $1.4 billion during the third fiscal quarter on unit volume that was unchanged. Unfavorable foreign exchange had a negative 3% impact on net sales. Pricing had a positive 2% impact on net sales. Negative mix had a 2% unfavorable impact to net sales due to declines of the Appliances category and the North America region which have higher than segment average selling prices. Organic sales decreased 1%. Global market share of the Grooming segment increased 0.8 points. Mid-single digits volume increases in Asia Pacific, IMEA and Latin America, were offset by a mid-teens decline in Greater China primarily due to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and a mid-single digits decline in North America. • Shave Care volume was unchanged. Volume increased high single digits in Asia Pacific, increased mid-single digits in Latin America and increased low single digits in IMEA due to product innovation and increased distribution in certain markets. This was offset by a double digit decline in Greater China (due to the economic slowdown resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic) and a mid-single digits decline in North America (due to limited distribution capacity in light of the COVID-19 pandemic). Global market share of the Shave Care category increased slightly. • Volume in Appliances decreased low single digits. Volume declined more than 30% in Greater China and declined high single digits in Asia Pacific due to the aforementioned COVID-19 impacts and competitive activity. This was partially offset by a more than 20% volume increase in IMEA, a high single digits increase in North America and a low single digits increase in Europe due to innovation and increased marketing spending in certain markets. Global market share of the Appliances category increased more than two points. Net earnings decreased 26% to $254 million due to the decrease in net sales and a 570 basis-point decrease in net earnings margin. The net earnings margin declined primarily due to an increase in effective tax rates due to the benefit in the base period from the favorable adjustments to reserves for uncertain tax positions. To a lesser extent the net earnings margin was impacted by a reduction in gross margin and an increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin decreased due to the negative impact of unfavorable mix (due to the disproportionate growth of disposable razor products and Asia Pacific and IMEA regions which have lower than segment average margins) and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, partially offset by the benefits of manufacturing cost savings and increased selling prices. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased due to the negative scale impacts of the net sales decline. Nine months ended March 31, 2020 compared with nine months ended March 31, 2019 Grooming fiscal year to date net sales was $4.6 billion, a decrease of 1%, on unit volume that was unchanged. Unfavorable foreign exchange had a negative 2% impact on net sales. Pricing had a positive 2% impact on net sales. Unfavorable mix was a negative 1% impact to net sales due to declines of the Appliances category and the North America region which have higher than segment average selling prices. Organic sales increased 1%. Global market share of the Grooming segment increased 0.3 points. A mid-single digits volume increase in Asia Pacific and low single digits increases in Europe, IMEA and Latin America were offset by mid-single digit declines in North America and in Greater China. • Shave Care volume increased low single digits. The volume increase was driven by a double digit increase in Asia Pacific and low single digits increases in Europe, IMEA and Latin America due to product innovation, partially offset by a mid-single digits decline in North America and Greater China due to market decline and to a lesser extent, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Global market share of the Shave Care category was unchanged. • Volume in Appliances decreased low single digits. A double digit decline in Asia Pacific and Greater China (due to market contraction, competitive activities and to a lesser extent the aforementioned impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic), was partially offset by mid-single digits volume increase in North America and low single digits increase in Europe due to innovation. Global market share of the Appliances category increased more than a point. Net earnings decreased 4% to $1.0 billion due to the decrease in net sales and an 80 basis-point decrease in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin decreased primarily due to an increase in effective tax rates and to a lesser extent a reduction in gross margin, partially offset by a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. The increase in tax rates was due to the benefit in the base period from the favorable adjustments to reserves for uncertain tax positions. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to a favorable legal settlement in the current period and a reduction in overhead costs due to productivity savings. Gross margin declined due to the negative impact of unfavorable mix (due to the disproportionate growth of disposable razor products and Asia Pacific and IMEA regions which have lower than segment average margins) and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, partially offset by the benefits of manufacturing cost savings and increased selling prices. Health Care Three months ended March 31, 2020 compared with three months ended March 31, 2019 Health Care net sales increased 7% to $2.3 billion during the third fiscal quarter on a 7% increase in unit volume. Unfavorable foreign exchange impacts decreased net sales by 2%. Pricing had a 1% positive impact to net sales for the quarter. Favorable mix increased net sales by 1% due to the disproportionate growth of the Personal Health Care category and the North America region, both of which have higher than segment average selling prices. Organic sales increased 9%. Global market share of the Health Care segment increased 0.8 points. The volume increase was led by double digit growth in Latin America and IMEA and high single digits growth in Europe and North America. This was partially offset by a mid-teens decline in Greater China due primarily to the COVID-19 pandemic related economic slowdown. • Oral Care volume increased mid-single digits. The volume increase was driven by over 20% growth in IMEA, mid-teens growth in Latin America, mid-single digits growth in Europe and low single digits growth in North America all driven by innovation and market growth. This was partially offset by a mid-teens volume decline in Greater China due to the economic slowdown related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Global market share of the Oral Care category increased less than a point. • Volume in Personal Health Care increased double digits versus the prior year period. The volume increase was driven by high teens growth in North America, mid-teens growth in Europe, high single digits growth in Latin America, and mid-single digits growth in IMEA, driven by innovation, increased marketing spending and increased consumption and pantry loading due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Global market share of the Personal Health Care category increased a point. Net earnings increased 14% to $408 million, due to the increase in net sales and a 110 basis-points increase in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin increased due to an increase in gross margin and a decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. The increase in gross margin was driven by the positive impacts of manufacturing cost savings and increased pricing, partially offset by unfavorable mix impact due to the disproportionate growth of certain markets in IMEA with lower than segment average margins. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to the positive scale benefits of the net sales increase and a reduction in overhead costs due to productivity savings. Nine months ended March 31, 2020 compared with nine months ended March 31, 2019 Health Care fiscal year to date net sales increased 13% to $7.0 billion on a 13% increase in unit volume. Excluding the impact of the Merck OTC consumer healthcare acquisition, organic sales increased 8% and organic volume increased 7%. Unfavorable foreign exchange impacts reduced net sales by 2%. Higher pricing increased net sales by 1%. Favorable mix increased net sales by 1% due to the disproportionate organic growth of the Personal Health Care category which has higher than segment average margins. Global market share of the Health Care segment increased 0.6 points. The volume increase was led by over 30% growth in IMEA, high teens growth in Latin America, mid-teens growth in Europe, double digit growth in Asia Pacific and high single digits growth in North America, partially offset by mid-single digits decrease in Greater China. Excluding the impact of the Merck OTC consumer healthcare acquisition, organic volume increased mid-teens in IMEA, increased high single digits in Latin America, increased mid-single digits in Europe and increased low single digits in Asia Pacific. • Oral Care volume increased mid-single digits. Increased volume was driven by over 20% growth in IMEA, double digits growth in Latin America, mid-single digits growth in Asia Pacific and North America and low single digits growth in Europe, all due to innovation and market growth. Excluding the impact of minor divestitures, volume in Europe grew mid-single digits.

Global market share of the Oral Care category increased half a point. • Volume in Personal Health Care increased more than 30% versus the prior period. Excluding the impact of the Merck OTC consumer healthcare acquisition, organic volume increased double digits. The organic volume increase was driven by mid-teens growth in Europe and double digits growth in North America (both due to innovation, increased marketing spending, and to a lesser extent the increased consumption and pantry loading due to the COVID-19 pandemic), a high single digits growth in IMEA and mid-single digits growth in Latin America (both due to innovation and increased marketing spending) partially offset by a low single digits decline in Asia Pacific due to devaluation-related price increases. Global market share of the Personal Health Care category increased more than half a point. Net earnings increased 14% to $1.4 billion due to the increase in net sales and a 10 basis-points increase in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin increased due to an increase in gross margin partially offset by an increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. The increase in gross margin was driven primarily by the positive impacts of increased pricing and manufacturing cost savings. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to an increase in overheads and other operating expenses primarily caused by the Merck OTC consumer healthcare acquisition, partially offset by the positive scale benefits of the net sales increase. Fabric & Home Care Three months ended March 31, 2020 compared with three months ended March 31, 2019 Fabric & Home Care net sales increased 8% to $5.8 billion during the third fiscal quarter on an 8% increase in unit volume.

Net earnings increased 13% to $957 million due to the increase in net sales and a 70 basis-points increase in net earnings margin. The net earnings margin increase was primarily due to an increase in gross margin, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. The gross margin increase was driven by manufacturing cost savings and a reduction in commodity costs, partially offset by unfavorable product mix due to the disproportionate growth of premium innovation that has not yet been cost optimized. The higher effective tax rate was due to the disproportionate growth in North America. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased marginally due primarily to higher marketing spending, partially offset by the positive scale benefits of the net sales increase. Nine months ended March 31, 2020 compared with nine months ended March 31, 2019 Fabric & Home Care fiscal year to date net sales increased 6% to $17.4 billion on a 6% increase in unit volume.

Corporate Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business segments. These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level; financing and investing activities; certain employee benefit costs; other general corporate items; the gains and losses related to certain divested brands and categories; and certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the reportable segments to U.S. GAAP. The most significant reconciling item includes income taxes to adjust from blended statutory rates that are reflected in the reportable segments to the overall Company effective tax rate. Corporate net sales decreased $7 million to $116 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2020 and decreased $62 million to $306 million for the fiscal year to date. Corporate net earnings improved by $20 million in the quarter primarily due to discrete tax benefits during the quarter that are not allocated to the segment, partially offset by higher restructuring charges, all of which have been described above. Fiscal year to date Corporate net earnings increased $26 million as tax benefits and lower interest expense in the current period were largely offset by the base period gain on the dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership. Restructuring Program to deliver Productivity and Cost Savings In 2012, the Company initiated a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs and better leverage scale in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overheads. The plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes to fund the Company's growth strategy. In 2017, the Company communicated specific elements of an additional multi-year productivity and cost savings program. The current productivity and cost savings plan is expected to further reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, certain marketing activities and overhead expenses. As part of this plan, the Company incurred $1.8 billion in total before-tax restructuring costs across fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019, with an additional amount of $0.5 to $0.6 billion expected in fiscal 2020. This program is expected to result in additional targeted enrollment reductions, along with further optimization of the supply chain and other manufacturing processes. Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the resulting charges are funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting. In addition to our restructuring programs, we have additional ongoing savings efforts in our supply chain, marketing and overhead areas that have and are expected to continue to yield additional benefits to our operating margins. Refer to Note 9 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the restructuring program. LIQUIDITY & CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating Activities We generated $12.6 billion of cash from operating activities fiscal year to date, an increase of $1.5 billion versus the prior year. Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, deferred income taxes and loss on sale of assets), generated $12.3 billion of operating cash flow. Working capital and other impacts generated $333 million of cash in the period. Accounts receivable decreased, generating $135 million of cash, primarily due to the timing of the quarter-end (which fell on a Tuesday versus Sunday in the prior year end, resulting in additional collection days in the current year). Inventory increased, consuming $533 million of cash primarily to support business growth, including increased manufacturing to help build safety stocks to help manage through the COVID-19 pandemic and product initiatives. Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities increased, generating $738 million of cash. Taxes payable accounted for approximately $400 million of this amount, primarily due to an approximate $500 million increase related to the integration of Merck, which had no impact on operating cash flows, as there was an equal and offsetting release of a deferred tax liability that was initially created on the acquisition of Merck. Extended payment terms to suppliers generated approximately $475 million of cash and all other accruals used approximately $140 million. All other operating assets and liabilities used $58 million of cash. Investing Activities Investing activities generated $3.7 billion of cash fiscal year to date. Capital expenditures were $2.4 billion, or 4.5% of net sales. We received $6.2 billion of cash from sales and maturities of investment securities. Financing Activities Our financing activities used $5.0 billion of net cash fiscal year to date. We used $7.4 billion for treasury stock purchases, $5.8 billion for dividends and $1.5 billion for debt repayments. Cash from the issuance of bonds and commercial paper generated $5.0 billion and $3.0 billion of cash, respectively, and the exercise of stock options and other impacts generated $1.8 billion of cash. As of March 31, 2020, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $5.8 billion. We have short- and long-term debt to meet our financing needs. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements. RECONCILIATION OF MEASURES NOT DEFINED BY U.S. GAAP In accordance with the SEC's Regulation S-K Item 10(e), the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measures. We believe that these measures provide useful perspective on underlying business results and trends (i.e., trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and provide a supplemental measure of year-on-year results. The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measure, but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted. Organic sales growth: Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. This measure is used in assessing achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. Adjusted free cash flow: Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the comprehensive U.S. legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017 (the U.S. Tax Act). Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. Management views adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments. Adjusted free cash flow productivity: Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings. Management views adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G’s ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. This measure is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. The Company's long-term target is to generate annual adjusted free cash flow productivity at or above 90 percent. Core EPS: Core earnings per share, or Core EPS, is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share adjusted as indicated. Management views this non-GAAP measure as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time. This measure is also used when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation. The Core earnings measures included in the following reconciliation tables refer to the equivalent GAAP measures adjusted as applicable for the following items: Incremental Restructuring: The Company has had and continues to have an ongoing level of restructuring activities. Such activities have resulted in ongoing annual restructuring related charges of approximately $250 - $500 million before tax. In 2012, the Company began a $10 billion strategic productivity and cost savings initiative that included incremental restructuring activities. In 2017, we communicated details of an additional multi-year productivity and cost savings plan. This results in incremental restructuring charges to accelerate productivity efforts and cost savings. The adjustment to Core earnings includes only the restructuring costs above what we believe are the normal recurring level of restructuring costs. Gain on Dissolution of PGT Healthcare Partnership: The Company finalized the dissolution of our PGT Healthcare partnership, a venture between the Company and Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries, Ltd. (Teva) in the OTC consumer healthcare business, in the quarter ended September 30, 2018. The transaction was accounted for as a sale of the Teva portion of the PGT business and resulted in the Company recognizing an after-tax gain on the dissolution of $353 million. We do not view the above items to be part of our sustainable results and their exclusion from Core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results. These items are also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation.

Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk There have been no material changes in the Company’s exposure to market risk since June 30, 2019. Additional information can be found in Note 7 - Risk Management Activities and Fair Value Measurements of the Consolidated Financial Statements. Item 4. Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures The Company’s Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, David S. Taylor, and the Company’s Vice Chairman, Chief Operating Officer and Chief Financial Officer, Jon R. Moeller, performed an evaluation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. Messrs. Taylor and Moeller have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including Messrs. Taylor and Moeller, to allow their timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the Company’s fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. PART II. OTHER INFORMATION Item 1. Legal Proceedings The Company is subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental issues, patent and trademark matters, labor and employment matters, and tax. Item 1A. Risk Factors We discuss our expectations regarding future performance, events and outcomes, such as our business outlook and objectives in this Form 10-Q, as well as in our quarterly and annual reports, current reports on Form 8-K, press releases and other written and oral communications. All statements, except for historical and present factual information, are “forward-looking statements” and are based on financial data and business plans available only as of the time the statements are made, which may become outdated or incomplete. We assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements as a result of new information, future events or other factors, except to the extent required by law. Forward-looking statements are inherently uncertain, and investors must recognize that events could significantly differ from our expectations. The following discussion of “risk factors” identifies significant factors that may adversely affect our business, operations, financial position or future financial performance. This information should be read in conjunction with the MD&A and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes incorporated in this report. The following discussion of risks is not all inclusive, but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our expectations. These and other factors could cause our future results to differ from those in the forward-looking statements and from historical trends, perhaps materially. Our business is subject to numerous risks as a result of our having significant operations and sales in international markets, including foreign currency fluctuations, currency exchange or pricing controls and localized volatility. We are a global company, with operations in approximately 70 countries and products sold in more than 180 countries and territories around the world. We hold assets, incur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and our operations outside the U.S. generate more than fifty percent of our net revenue. Fluctuations in exchange rates for foreign currencies may reduce the U.S. dollar value of revenues, profits and cash flows we receive from non-U.S. markets, increase our supply costs (as measured in U.S. dollars) in those markets, negatively impact our competitiveness in those markets or otherwise adversely impact our business results or financial condition. Moreover, discriminatory or conflicting fiscal or trade policies in different countries, including changes to tariffs and existing trade policies and agreements, could adversely affect our results. See also the Results of Operations and Cash Flow, Financial Condition and Liquidity sections of the MD&A, the Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes. We also have businesses and maintain local currency cash balances in a number of countries with currency exchange, import authorization, pricing or other controls or restrictions, such as Nigeria, Algeria, Egypt and Turkey. Our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage such controls and restrictions, continue existing business operations and repatriate earnings from overseas, or if new or increased tariffs, quotas, exchange or price controls, trade barriers or similar restrictions are imposed on our business. Additionally, our business, operations or employees may be adversely affected by political volatility, labor market disruptions or other crises or vulnerabilities in individual countries or regions, including political instability or upheaval, broad economic instability or sovereign risk related to a default by or deterioration in the credit worthiness of local governments, particularly in emerging markets. Uncertain global economic conditions may adversely impact demand for our products or cause our customers and other business partners to suffer financial hardship, which could adversely impact our business. Our business could be negatively impacted by reduced demand for our products related to one or more significant local, regional or global economic disruptions, such as: a slow-down in the general economy; reduced market growth rates; tighter credit markets for our suppliers, vendors or customers; a significant shift in government policies; the deterioration of economic relations between countries or regions, including potential negative consumer sentiment toward non-local products or sources; or the inability to conduct day-to-day transactions through our financial intermediaries to pay funds to or collect funds from our customers, vendors and suppliers. Additionally, economic conditions may cause our suppliers, distributors, contractors or other third-party partners to suffer financial difficulties that they cannot overcome, resulting in their inability to provide us with the materials and services we need, in which case our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Customers may also suffer financial hardships due to economic conditions such that their accounts become uncollectible or are subject to longer collection cycles. In addition, if we are unable to generate sufficient income and cash flow, it could affect the Company’s ability to achieve expected share repurchase and dividend payments. Disruptions in credit markets or changes to our credit ratings may reduce our access to credit. A disruption in the credit markets or a downgrade of our current credit rating could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, which could adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources or significantly increase our cost of capital. Disruption in our global supply chain may negatively impact our business results. Our ability to meet our customers’ needs and achieve cost targets depends on our ability to maintain key manufacturing and supply arrangements, including execution of supply chain optimizations and certain sole supplier or sole manufacturing plant arrangements. The loss or disruption of such manufacturing and supply arrangements, including for issues such as labor disputes, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, discontinuity in our internal information and data systems, inability to procure sufficient raw or input materials, significant changes in trade policy, natural disasters, increasing severity or frequency of extreme weather events due to climate change or otherwise, acts of war or terrorism, or disease outbreaks or other external factors over which we have no control, have interrupted product supply and, if not effectively managed and remedied, could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our businesses face cost fluctuations and pressures that could affect our business results. Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in the prices of commodities and raw materials and the costs of labor, transportation, energy, pension and healthcare. Therefore, our business results are dependent, in part, on our continued ability to manage these fluctuations through pricing actions, cost saving projects and sourcing decisions, while maintaining and improving margins and market share. Failure to manage these fluctuations could adversely impact our financial results. Our ability to meet our growth targets depends on successful product, marketing and operations innovation and successful responses to competitive innovation and changing consumer habits . We are a consumer products company that relies on continued global demand for our brands and products. Achieving our business results depends, in part, on successfully developing, introducing and marketing new products and on making significant improvements to our equipment and manufacturing processes. The success of such innovation depends on our ability to correctly anticipate customer and consumer acceptance and trends, to obtain, maintain and enforce necessary intellectual property protections and to avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others. We must also successfully respond to technological advances made by, and intellectual property rights granted to, competitors. Failure to continually innovate, improve and respond to competitive moves and changing consumer habits could compromise our competitive position and adversely impact our results. The ability to achieve our business objectives is dependent on how well we can compete with our local and global competitors in new and existing markets and channels. The consumer products industry is highly competitive. Across all of our categories, we compete against a wide variety of global and local competitors. As a result, we experience ongoing competitive pressures in the environments in which we operate, which may result in challenges in maintaining profit margins. To address these challenges, we must be able to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends, including pricing, promotional incentives, product delivery windows and trade terms. In addition, evolving sales channels and business models may affect customer and consumer preferences as well as market dynamics, which, for example, may be seen in the growing consumer preference for shopping online, ease of competitive entry into certain categories, and growth in hard discounter channels. Failure to successfully respond to competitive factors and emerging retail trends, and effectively compete in growing sales channels and business models, particularly e-commerce and mobile commerce applications, could negatively impact our results. A significant change in customer relationships or in customer demand for our products could have a significant impact on our business. We sell most of our products via retail customers, which include mass merchandisers, e-commerce, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, high-frequency stores and pharmacies. Our success is dependent on our ability to successfully manage relationships with our retail trade customers, which includes our ability to offer trade terms that are mutually acceptable and are aligned with our pricing and profitability targets. Continued concentration among our retail customers could create significant cost and margin pressure on our business, and our business performance could suffer if we cannot reach agreement with a key customer on trade terms and principles. Our business could also be negatively impacted if a key customer were to significantly reduce the inventory level or shelf space of our products as a result of increased offerings of private label brands and generic non-branded products or for other reasons, significantly tighten product delivery windows or experience a significant business disruption. If the reputation of the Company or one or more of our brands erodes significantly, it could have a material impact on our financial results. The Company's reputation, and the reputation of our brands, form the foundation of our relationships with key stakeholders and other constituencies, including consumers, customers and suppliers. The quality and safety of our products are critical to our business. Many of our brands have worldwide recognition and our financial success is directly dependent on the success of our brands. The success of our brands can suffer if our marketing plans or product initiatives do not have the desired impact on a brand's image or its ability to attract consumers. Our results could also be negatively impacted if one of our brands suffers substantial harm to its reputation due to a significant product recall, product-related litigation, defects or impurities in our products, product misuse, changing consumer perceptions of certain ingredients or environmental impacts, allegations of product tampering or the distribution and sale of counterfeit products. Additionally, negative or inaccurate postings or comments on social media or networking websites about the Company or one of its brands could generate adverse publicity that could damage the reputation of our brands or the Company. If we are unable to effectively manage real or perceived issues, including concerns about safety, quality, ingredients, efficacy, environmental impacts or similar matters, sentiments toward the Company or our products could be negatively impacted, and our financial results could suffer. Our Company also devotes time and resources to citizenship efforts that are consistent with our corporate values and are designed to strengthen our business and protect and preserve our reputation, including programs driving ethics and corporate responsibility, strong communities, diversity and inclusion, gender equality and environmental sustainability. If these programs are not executed as planned or suffer negative publicity, the Company's reputation and financial results could be adversely impacted. We rely on third parties in many aspects of our business, which creates additional risk. Due to the scale and scope of our business, we must rely on relationships with third parties, including our suppliers, contract manufacturers, distributors, contractors, commercial banks, joint venture partners and external business partners, for certain functions. If we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships and the agreements under which our third-party partners operate, our financial results could suffer. Further, failure of these third parties to meet their obligations to the Company or substantial disruptions in the relationships between the Company and these third parties could adversely impact our operations and results. Additionally, while we have policies and procedures for managing these relationships, they inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, governance and compliance, thereby potentially increasing our financial, legal, reputational and operational risk. An information security or operational technology incident, including a cybersecurity breach, or the failure of one or more key information or operations technology systems, networks, hardware, processes, and/or associated sites owned or operated by the Company or one of its service providers could have a material adverse impact on our business or reputation. As part of the Company’s regular review of potential risks, we maintain an information and operational technology (“IT/OT”) risk management program that is primarily supervised by information technology management and reviewed by internal cross-functional stakeholders. As part of this program, analyses of emerging cybersecurity threats as well as the Company’s plans and strategies to address them are regularly prepared and presented to senior management, the Audit Committee and the Board of Directors. Despite our policies, procedures and programs, including this IT/OT risk management program, we may not be effective in identifying and mitigating every risk to which we are exposed. We rely extensively on IT/OT systems, networks and services, including internet and intranet sites, data hosting and processing facilities and technologies, physical security systems and other hardware, software and technical applications and platforms, many of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties or their vendors, to assist in conducting our business. The various uses of these IT/OT systems, networks and services include, but are not limited to: • ordering and managing materials from suppliers; • converting materials to finished products; • shipping products to customers; • marketing and selling products to consumers; • collecting, transferring, storing and/or processing customer, consumer, employee, vendor, investor, and other stakeholder information and personal data, including such data from persons covered by an expanding landscape of privacy and data regulations, such as citizens of the European Union who are covered by the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”); • summarizing and reporting results of operations, including financial reporting; • managing our banking and other cash liquidity systems and platforms; • hosting, processing and sharing, as appropriate, confidential and proprietary research, business plans and financial information; • collaborating via an online and efficient means of global business communications; • complying with regulatory, legal and tax requirements; • providing data security; and • handling other processes necessary to manage our business. Numerous and evolving information security threats, including advanced persistent cybersecurity threats, pose a risk to the security of our services, systems, networks and supply chain, as well as to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and of our critical business operations. As cybersecurity threats rapidly evolve in sophistication and become more prevalent across the industry globally, the Company is continually increasing its attention to these threats. We assess potential threats and vulnerabilities and make investments seeking to address them, including ongoing monitoring and updating of networks and systems, increasing specialized information security skills, deploying employee security training, and updating security policies for the Company and its third-party providers. However, because the techniques, tools and tactics used in cyber-attacks frequently change and may be difficult to detect for periods of time, we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures or fully mitigating harms after such an attack. Our IT/OT databases and systems and our third-party providers’ databases and systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subject to advanced computer viruses or other malicious codes, ransomware, unauthorized access attempts, denial of service attacks, phishing, social engineering, hacking and other cyber-attacks. Such attacks may originate from outside parties, hackers, criminal organizations or other threat actors, including nation states. In addition, insider actors-malicious or otherwise-could cause technical disruptions and/or confidential data leakage. To date, we have seen no material impact on our business or operations from these attacks; however, we cannot guarantee that our security efforts or the security efforts of our third-party providers will prevent material breaches, operational incidents or other breakdowns to our or our third-party providers’ IT/OT databases or systems. Periodically, we also need to upgrade our IT/OT systems or adopt new technologies. If such a new system or technology does not function properly or otherwise exposes us to increased cybersecurity breaches and failures, it could affect our ability to order materials, make and ship orders, and process payments in addition to other operational and information integrity and loss issues. Further, if the IT/OT systems, networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly or cause operational outages or aberrations, or if we or one of our third-party providers suffer significant unavailability of key operations, or inadvertent disclosure of, lack of integrity of, or loss of our sensitive business or stakeholder information, due to any number of causes, ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling, security incidents or employee error or malfeasance, and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may be exposed to reputational, competitive, operational, financial and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action. The costs and operational consequences of responding to the above items and implementing remediation measures could be significant and could adversely impact our results. Changing political conditions could adversely impact our business and financial results. Changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products may be difficult to predict and may adversely affect our business and financial results. For example, the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union (""Brexit"") has created uncertainty regarding, among other things, the U.K.'s future legal and economic framework and how the U.K. will interact with other countries, including with respect to the free movement of goods, services, capital and people. In addition, results of elections, referendums or other political processes in certain markets in which our products are manufactured, sold or distributed could create uncertainty regarding how existing governmental policies, laws and regulations may change, including with respect to sanctions, taxes, the movement of goods, services, capital and people between countries and other matters. The potential implications of such uncertainty, which include, among others, exchange rate fluctuations, tariffs, trade barriers and market contraction, could adversely affect the Company’s business and financial results. We must successfully manage compliance with laws and regulations, as well as manage new and pending legal and regulatory matters in the U.S. and abroad. Our business is subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations across the countries in which we do business, including those laws and regulations involving intellectual property, product liability, product composition or formulation, packaging content or disposability, marketing, antitrust, data protection, environmental (including climate, water, waste), employment, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, tax, accounting and financial reporting or other matters. Rapidly changing laws, regulations, policies and related interpretations, as well as increased enforcement actions, create challenges for the Company, including our compliance and ethics programs, may alter the environment in which we do business and may increase the ongoing costs of compliance, which could adversely impact our financial results. If we are unable to continue to meet these challenges and comply with all laws, regulations, policies and related interpretations, it could negatively impact our reputation and our business results. Failure to successfully manage regulatory and legal matters and resolve such matters without significant liability or damage to our reputation may materially adversely impact our results of operations and financial position. Furthermore, if pending legal or regulatory matters result in fines or costs in excess of the amounts accrued to date, that may also materially impact our results of operations and financial position. Changes in applicable tax regulations and resolutions of tax disputes could negatively affect our financial results. The Company is subject to taxation in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Changes in the various tax laws can and do occur. For example, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “U.S. Tax Act”). The changes included in the U.S. Tax Act are broad and complex. The ongoing impacts of the U.S. Tax Act may differ from the estimates provided elsewhere in the reports we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations, any regulatory guidance or legislative action to address questions that arise or any updates or changes to estimates the Company has used to calculate the impacts. Additionally, longstanding international tax norms that determine each country’s jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade are subject to potential evolution. An outgrowth of the original Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (“BEPS"") project is a new project undertaken by more than 130 member countries of the expanded OECD Inclusive Framework focused on ""Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy."" The breadth of this project extends beyond pure digital businesses and is likely to impact all multinational businesses by potentially redefining jurisdictional taxation rights. As this and other tax laws and related regulations change or evolve, our financial results could be materially impacted. Given the unpredictability of these possible changes, it is very difficult to assess whether the overall effect of such potential tax changes would be cumulatively positive or negative for our earnings and cash flow, but such changes could adversely impact our financial results. Furthermore, we are subject to regular review and audit by both foreign and domestic tax authorities. While we believe our tax positions will be sustained, the final outcome of tax audits and related litigation, including maintaining our intended tax treatment of divestiture transactions such as the fiscal 2017 Beauty Brands transaction with Coty, may differ materially from the tax amounts recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements, which could adversely impact our cash flows and financial results. We must successfully manage ongoing acquisition, joint venture and divestiture activities. As a company that manages a portfolio of consumer brands, our ongoing business model includes a certain level of acquisition, joint venture and divestiture activities. We must be able to successfully manage the impacts of these activities, while at the same time delivering against our business objectives. Specifically, our financial results could be adversely impacted by the dilutive impacts from the loss of earnings associated with divested brands or dissolution of joint ventures. Our financial results have been, and in the future could also be, impacted by acquisitions or joint venture activities, such as the integration of Merck KGaA's Consumer Health business acquired in fiscal 2019, if: 1) changes in the cash flows or other market-based assumptions cause the value of acquired assets to fall below book value, or 2) we are not able to deliver the expected cost and growth synergies associated with such acquisitions and joint ventures, including as a result of integration and collaboration challenges, which could also have an impact on goodwill and intangible assets. Our business results depend on our ability to successfully manage productivity improvements and ongoing organizational change. Our financial projections assume certain ongoing productivity improvements and cost savings, including staffing adjustments as well as employee departures. Failure to deliver these planned productivity improvements and cost savings, while continuing to invest in business growth, could adversely impact our financial results. Additionally, successfully executing organizational change, including the move to a new organizational structure in fiscal 2020, management transitions at leadership levels of the Company and motivation and retention of key employees, is critical to our business success. Factors that may affect our ability to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified employees include employee morale, our reputation, competition from other employers and availability of qualified personnel. Our success is dependent on identifying, developing and retaining key employees to provide uninterrupted leadership and direction for our business. This includes developing and retaining organizational capabilities in key growth markets where the depth of skilled or experienced employees may be limited and competition for these resources is intense, as well as continuing the development and execution of robust leadership succession plans. We must successfully manage the demand, supply, and operational challenges associated with the actual or perceived effects of a disease outbreak, including epidemics, pandemics, or similar widespread public health concerns. Our business may be negatively impacted by the fear of exposure to or actual effects of a disease outbreak, epidemic, pandemic, or similar widespread public health concern, such as travel restrictions or recommendations or mandates from governmental authorities to avoid large gatherings or to self-quarantine as a result of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. These impacts include, but are not limited to: • Significant reductions in demand or significant volatility in demand for one or more of our products, which may be caused by, among other things: the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine or other travel restrictions, or financial hardship, shifts in demand away from one or more of our more discretionary or higher priced products to lower priced products, or stockpiling or similar pantry-loading activity; if prolonged, such impacts can further increase the difficulty of planning for operations and may adversely impact our results; • Inability to meet our customers’ needs and achieve cost targets due to disruptions in our manufacturing and supply arrangements caused by constrained workforce capacity or the loss or disruption of other essential manufacturing and supply elements such as raw materials or other finished product components, transportation, or other manufacturing and distribution capability; • Failure of third parties on which we rely, including our suppliers, contract manufacturers, distributors, contractors, commercial banks, joint venture partners and external business partners, to meet their obligations to the Company, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties and may adversely impact our operations; or • Significant changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products, including quarantines, import/export restrictions, price controls, or governmental or regulatory actions, closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities, restrict our employees’ ability to travel or perform necessary business functions, or otherwise prevent our third-party partners, suppliers, or customers from sufficiently staffing operations, including operations necessary for the production, distribution, sale, and support of our products, which could adversely impact our results. Despite our efforts to manage and remedy these impacts to the Company, their ultimate impact also depends on factors beyond our knowledge or control, including the duration and severity of any such outbreak as well as third-party actions taken to contain its spread and mitigate its public health effects.

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Basis of Presentation These statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of The Procter & Gamble Company and subsidiaries (the ""Company,"" ""Procter & Gamble,"" ""P&G,"" ""we"" or ""our"") contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods reported. However, the results of operations included in such financial statements may not necessarily be indicative of annual results. 2. New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies On July 1, 2019, we adopted ASU 2016-02, ""Leases (Topic 842)."" The new accounting standard requires the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all long-term leases, including operating leases, on the balance sheet. We elected the optional transition method and adopted the new guidance on a modified retrospective basis with no restatement of prior period amounts. As allowed under the new accounting standard, we elected to apply practical expedients to carry forward the original lease determinations, lease classifications and accounting of initial direct costs for all asset classes at the time of adoption. The adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements, resulting in an increase of approximately 1 % to each of our total assets and total liabilities on our balance sheet as of July 1, 2019. See Note 10 for further information. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, ""Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment."" The standard simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by requiring a goodwill impairment to be measured using a single step impairment model, whereby the impairment equals the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value of the specified reporting units in their entirety. This eliminates the second step of the current impairment model that requires companies to first estimate the fair value of all assets in a reporting unit and measure impairments based on those estimated fair values and a residual measurement approach. It also specifies that any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We will adopt the standard no later than July 1, 2020. The impact of the new standard will be dependent on the specific facts and circumstances of future individual impairments, if any. No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had, or is expected to have, a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 3. Segment Information Under U.S. GAAP, our operating segments are aggregated into five reportable segments: 1) Beauty, 2) Grooming, 3) Health Care, 4) Fabric & Home Care and 5) Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Our five reportable segments are comprised of: • Beauty : Hair Care (Conditioner, Shampoo, Styling Aids, Treatments); Skin and Personal Care (Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Personal Cleansing, Skin Care); • Grooming : Shave Care (Female Blades & Razors, Male Blades & Razors, Pre- and Post-Shave Products, Other Shave Care); Appliances • Health Care : Oral Care (Toothbrushes, Toothpaste, Other Oral Care); Personal Health Care (Gastrointestinal, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements, Pain Relief, Other Personal Health Care); • Fabric & Home Care : Fabric Care (Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Additives, Laundry Detergents); Home Care (Air Care, Dish Care, P&G Professional, Surface Care); and • Baby, Feminine & Family Care : Baby Care (Baby Wipes, Taped Diapers and Pants); Feminine Care (Adult Incontinence, Feminine Care); Family Care (Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper).

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill is allocated by reportable segment as follows: Beauty Grooming Health Care Fabric & Home Care Baby, Feminine & Family Care Total Company Goodwill at June 30, 2019 $ 12,985 $ 12,881 $ 7,972 $ 1,855 $ 4,580 $ 40,273 Acquisitions and divestitures ( 1 ) — ( 55 ) — — ( 56 ) Translation and other ( 82 ) ( 48 ) ( 56 ) ( 8 ) ( 25 ) ( 219 ) Goodwill at December 31, 2019 $ 12,902 $ 12,833 $ 7,861 $ 1,847 $ 4,555 $ 39,998 Goodwill from current year acquisitions and divestitures primarily reflects opening balance sheet adjustments from the prior year acquisition of the over-the-counter (OTC) healthcare business of Merck KGaA (Merck OTC) in the Health Care reportable segment (see Note 12), along with adjustments from a prior year Beauty acquisition. Identifiable intangible assets at December 31, 2019 were comprised of: Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Intangible assets with determinable lives $ 8,509 $ ( 5,556 ) Intangible assets with indefinite lives 21,027 — Total identifiable intangible assets $ 29,536 $ ( 5,556 ) Intangible assets with determinable lives consist of brands, patents, technology and customer relationships. The intangible assets with indefinite lives consist of brands. The amortization expense of determinable lived intangible assets for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $ 91 and $ 81 , respectively. For the six months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, the amortization expense was $ 187 and $ 154 , respectively. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested annually for impairment. The test to evaluate goodwill for impairment is a two-step process. In the first step, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, we perform a second step (the step two testing) to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. The step two testing of the impairment analysis requires a valuation of a reporting unit's tangible and intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of purchase price in a business combination. If the resulting implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is less than its carrying value, that difference represents an impairment. The business unit valuations used to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment, margin expansion and Company business plans. We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable. However, future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. Our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets occurs during the three months ended December 31. Most of our goodwill reporting units are comprised of a combination of legacy and acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that, at a minimum, exceed two times their underlying carrying values. Certain of our goodwill reporting units, in particular Shave Care and Appliances, are comprised entirely of acquired businesses and as a result, have fair value cushions that are not as high. The Appliances reporting unit has a fair value that significantly exceeds the underlying carrying value. As previously disclosed, the carrying value of the Shave Care reporting unit and the related Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset were impaired during the quarter ended June 30, 2019. The underlying reductions in fair values were due in large part to significant currency devaluations in a number of countries relative to the U.S. dollar, a deceleration of category growth caused by changing grooming habits, primarily in the developed markets, and an increased competitive market environment in the U.S. and certain other markets. As a result of the June 30, 2019 impairment determined by the step two testing, the Shave Care fair value exceeded the carrying value by approximately 20 % as of June 30, 2019. Because the impairment testing for intangible assets is a one-step process, the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset fair value approximated its carrying value at that date. During our annual impairment testing during the quarter ended December 31, 2019, based on developments in the macroeconomic environment we reduced the discount rate used in the valuation. As a result of this change and updates to other underlying cash flow projections, the Shave Care fair value exceeded the carrying value by more than 20 % and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset fair value exceeded the carrying value by approximately 5 %. The Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset continues to be susceptible to future impairment risk. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the net sales and earnings growth rates (including residual growth rates) and discount rate. The residual growth rate represents the expected rate at which the reporting unit and Gillette brand are expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period. The residual growth rate utilized in our fair value estimates is consistent with the reporting unit and brand operating plans and approximates expected long term category market growth rates. The residual growth rate is dependent on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, relative currency exchange rates and business activities that impact market share. As a result, the residual growth rate could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes, devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or an increased competitive environment. The discount rate, which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, such as further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar. Spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the U.S. While management can and has implemented strategies to address these events, changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that would trigger future impairment charges of the reporting unit's goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. As of December 31, 2019, the carrying values of the Shave Care goodwill and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset were $ 12.5 billion and $ 14.1 billion, respectively. The table below provides a sensitivity analysis for the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite lived intangible asset, utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the shorter term and residual growth rates and the discount rate, to demonstrate the potential impacts to the estimated fair values. The table below provides, in isolation, the estimated fair value impacts related to a 25 basis-point increase in the discount rate or a 25 basis-point decrease in our shorter-term and residual growth rates. Approximate Percent Change in Estimated Fair Value +25 bps Discount Rate -25 bps Growth Rates Shave Care goodwill reporting unit ( 6 ) % ( 6 ) % Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset ( 6 ) % ( 6 ) % 5. Earnings Per Share Basic net earnings per common share are calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble less preferred dividends by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net earnings per common share are calculated using the treasury stock method, on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of stock options and other stock-based awards and the assumed conversion of preferred stock. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. Net earnings per share were as follows: CONSOLIDATED AMOUNTS Three Months Ended December 31 Six Months Ended December 31 2019 2018 2019 2018 Net earnings $ 3,743 $ 3,216 $ 7,360 $ 6,427 Less: Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 26 22 50 34 Net earnings attributable to P&G (Diluted) 3,717 3,194 7,310 6,393 Preferred dividends ( 64 ) ( 65 ) ( 129 ) ( 131 ) Net earnings attributable to P&G available to common shareholders (Basic) $ 3,653 $ 3,129 $ 7,181 $ 6,262 SHARES IN MILLIONS Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 2,487.0 2,499.7 2,495.5 2,497.8 Add: Effect of dilutive securities Conversion of preferred shares (1) 86.4 90.7 86.9 91.3 Impact of stock options and other unvested equity awards (2) 56.7 32.6 56.4 28.5 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 2,630.1 2,623.0 2,638.8 2,617.6 NET EARNINGS PER SHARE (3) Basic $ 1.47 $ 1.25 $ 2.88 $ 2.51 Diluted $ 1.41 $ 1.22 $ 2.77 $ 2.44 (1) Despite being included currently in Diluted net earnings per common share, the actual conversion to common stock occurs when the preferred shares are sold. Shares may only be sold after being allocated to the ESOP participants pursuant to the repayment of the ESOP's obligations through 2035. (2) Weighted average outstanding stock options of approximately 23 million for the three months ended December 31, 2018, and approximately 2 million and 35 million for the six months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 respectively, were not included in the Diluted net earnings per share calculation because the options were out of the money or to do so would have been antidilutive (i.e., the total proceeds upon exercise would have exceeded the market value of the underlying common shares). There were no antidilutive shares for the three months ended December 31, 2019. (3) Net earnings per share are calculated on Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble. 6. Share-Based Compensation and Postretirement Benefits The following table provides a summary of our share-based compensation expense and postretirement benefit costs: Three Months Ended December 31 Six Months Ended December 31 2019 2018 2019 2018 Share-based compensation expense $ 92 $ 79 $ 202 $ 181 Net periodic benefit cost for pension benefits (1) 44 36 84 64 Net periodic benefit cost/(credit) for other retiree benefits (1) ( 52 ) ( 42 ) ( 104 ) ( 83 ) (1) The components of the total net periodic benefit cost for both pension benefits and other retiree benefits for these interim periods, on an annualized basis, do not differ materially from the amounts disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. 7. Risk Management Activities and Fair Value Measurements As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. There have been no significant changes in our risk management policies or activities during the six months ended December 31, 2019. The Company has not changed its valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period. The Company recognizes transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of each quarter. There were no transfers between levels during the periods presented. Also, there was no significant activity within the Level 3 assets and liabilities during the periods presented. There were no significant assets or liabilities that were remeasured at fair value on a non-recurring basis for the six months ended December 31, 2019. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. Other investments had a fair value of $ 64 and $ 169 as of December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019, respectively, and are presented in Other noncurrent assets. During the six months ended December 31, 2019, the Company sold all of its existing U.S. government securities and corporate bond securities. Such securities were presented in Available-for-sale investment securities at June 30, 2019, and had fair values of $ 3,648 and $ 2,400 , respectively. The Company's investments measured at fair value are generally classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Cash equivalents were $ 5,175 and $ 2,956 as of December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019, respectively, and are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. There are no other material investment balances classified as Level 1 or Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy or using net asset value as a practical expedient. Fair values are generally estimated based upon quoted market prices for similar instruments. The fair value of long-term debt was $ 23,746 and $ 25,378 as of December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019, respectively. This includes the current portion of long-term debt instruments ($ 3,008 and $ 3,390 as of December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019, respectively). Certain long-term debt (debt designated as a fair value hedge) is recorded at fair value. All other long-term debt is recorded at amortized cost but is measured at fair value for disclosure purposes. We consider our debt to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Fair values are generally estimated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments. Disclosures about Financial Instruments The notional amounts and fair values of financial instruments used in hedging transactions as of December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019 are as follows: Notional Amount Fair Value Asset Fair Value (Liability) December 31, 2019 June 30, 2019 December 31, 2019 June 30, 2019 December 31, 2019 June 30, 2019 DERIVATIVES IN FAIR VALUE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Interest rate contracts $ 7,097 $ 7,721 $ 128 $ 177 $ ( 5 ) $ ( 1 ) DERIVATIVES IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Foreign currency interest rate contracts $ 3,291 $ 3,157 $ 13 $ 35 $ ( 25 ) $ ( 24 ) TOTAL DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS $ 10,388 $ 10,878 $ 141 $ 212 $ ( 30 ) $ ( 25 ) DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS Foreign currency contracts $ 5,794 $ 6,431 $ 49 $ 27 $ ( 17 ) $ ( 20 ) TOTAL DERIVATIVES AT FAIR VALUE $ 16,182 $ 17,309 $ 190 $ 239 $ ( 47 ) $ ( 45 ) All derivative assets are presented in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Other noncurrent assets. All derivative liabilities are presented in Accrued and other liabilities or Other noncurrent liabilities. The fair value of the interest rate derivative asset/(liability) directly offsets the cumulative amount of the fair value hedging adjustment included in the carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation. The carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation, which includes the unamortized discount or premium and the fair value adjustment, was $ 7,188 and $ 7,860 as of December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019, respectively. In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges. The carrying value of those debt instruments designated as net investment hedges, which includes the adjustment for the foreign currency transaction gain or loss on those instruments, was $ 16,926 and $ 17,154 as of December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019, respectively. Changes in the fair value of net investment hedges are recognized in the Foreign currency translation component of Other comprehensive income (OCI). All of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. Before tax gains/(losses) on our financial instruments in hedging relationships are categorized as follows: Amount of Gain/(Loss) Recognized in OCI on Derivatives Three Months Ended December 31 Six Months Ended December 31 2019 2018 2019 2018 DERIVATIVES IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS (1) (2) Foreign exchange contracts $ ( 82 ) $ 23 $ 31 $ 19 (1) For the derivatives in net investment hedging relationships, the amount of gain/(loss) excluded from effectiveness testing, which was recognized in earnings, was $ 21 and $ 13 for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The amount of gain/(loss) excluded from effectiveness testing was $ 40 and $ 27 for the six months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. (2) In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges. The amount of gain/(loss) recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (AOCI) for such instruments was $( 428 ) and $ 228 for the three months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The amount of gain/(loss) recognized in AOCI for such instruments was $ 181 and $ 241 for the six months ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Amount of Gain/(Loss) Recognized in Earnings Three Months Ended December 31 Six Months Ended December 31 2019 2018 2019 2018 DERIVATIVES IN FAIR VALUE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Interest rate contracts $ ( 143 ) $ 42 $ ( 53 ) $ 18 DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS Foreign currency contracts $ 85 $ ( 5 ) $ ( 12 ) $ ( 7 ) The gain/(loss) on the derivatives in fair value hedging relationships is fully offset by the mark-to-market impact of the related exposure. These are both recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in Interest expense. The gain/(loss) on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is substantially offset by the currency mark-to-market of the related exposure. These are both recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A). 8. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss) The table below presents the changes in AOCI, including the reclassifications out of AOCI by component: Investment Securities Pension and Other Retiree Benefits Foreign Currency Translation Total AOCI Balance at June 30, 2019 $ 11 $ ( 4,198 ) $ ( 10,749 ) $ ( 14,936 ) OCI before reclassifications (1) ( 4 ) ( 6 ) ( 148 ) ( 158 ) Amounts reclassified from AOCI into the Consolidated Statements of Earnings (2) ( 2 ) 148 — 146 Net current period OCI ( 6 ) 142 ( 148 ) ( 12 ) Less: Other comprehensive income/(loss) attributable to non-controlling interests — — ( 6 ) ( 6 ) Balance at December 31, 2019 $ 5 $ ( 4,056 ) $ ( 10,891 ) $ ( 14,942 ) (1) Net of tax expense/(benefit) of $( 1 ), $ 13 and $ 50 for gains/losses on investment securities, pension and other retiree benefit items and foreign currency translation, respectively. (2) Net of tax expense/(benefit) of $ 0 , $ 44 and $ 0 for gains/losses on investment securities, pension and other retiree benefit items and foreign currency translation, respectively. The below provides additional details on amounts reclassified from AOCI into the Consolidated Statements of Earnings: • Investment securities: amounts reclassified from AOCI into Other non-operating income, net. • Pension and other retiree benefits: amounts reclassified from AOCI into Other non-operating income, net and included in the computation of net periodic postretirement costs. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. 9. Restructuring Program The Company has historically incurred an ongoing annual level of restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Before-tax costs incurred under the ongoing program have generally ranged from $ 250 to $ 500 annually. In fiscal 2017 the Company announced specific elements of a multi-year productivity and cost savings plan to further reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, certain marketing activities and overhead expenses. This program is expected to result in incremental targeted enrollment reductions, along with further optimization of the supply chain and other manufacturing processes. Restructuring costs incurred consist primarily of costs to separate employees, asset-related costs to exit facilities and other costs. For the three and six month period ended December 31, 2019, the Company incurred total restructuring charges of $ 105 and $ 198 , respectively. Of these charges incurred, approximately $ 63 and $ 133 were recorded in Cost of products sold and approximately $ 37 and $ 59 were recorded in SG&A, respectively. The remainder of these charges were recorded in Other non-operating income, net. The following table presents restructuring activity for the six months ended December 31, 2019: Reserve Balance Charges Previously Reported (Three Months Ended September 30, 2019) Charges for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2019 Six Months Ended December 31, 2019 Reserve Balance June 30, 2019 Cash Spent Charges Against Assets December 31, 2019 Separations $ 280 $ 34 $ 47 $ ( 80 ) $ — $ 281 Asset-related costs — 45 28 — ( 73 ) — Other costs 188 14 30 ( 49 ) — 183 Total $ 468 $ 93 $ 105 $ ( 129 ) $ ( 73 ) $ 464 Separation Costs Employee separation charges for the three and six month period ended December 31, 2019 relate to severance packages for approximately 190 and 370 employees, respectively. The packages were primarily voluntary and the amounts were calculated based on salary levels and past service periods. Severance costs related to voluntary separations are generally charged to earnings when the employee accepts the offer. Asset-Related Costs Asset-related costs consist of both asset write-downs and accelerated depreciation. Asset write-downs relate to the establishment of a new fair value basis for assets held-for-sale or disposal. These assets were written down to the lower of their current carrying basis or amounts expected to be realized upon disposal, less minor disposal costs. Charges for accelerated depreciation relate to long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period. These assets relate primarily to manufacturing consolidations and technology standardizations. The asset-related charges will not have a significant impact on future depreciation charges. Other Costs Other restructuring-type charges are incurred as a direct result of the restructuring program. Such charges primarily include asset removal and termination of contracts related to supply chain optimization. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the restructuring program charges are funded by and included within Corporate for both management and segment reporting. Accordingly, all of the charges under the program are included within the Corporate reportable segment. However, for informative purposes, the following table summarizes the total restructuring costs related to our reportable segments: Three Months Ended December 31, 2019 Six Months Ended December 31, 2019 Beauty $ 5 $ 13 Grooming 14 32 Health Care 12 24 Fabric & Home Care 7 11 Baby, Feminine & Family Care 9 29 Corporate (1) 58 89 Total Company $ 105 $ 198 (1) Corporate includes costs related to allocated overheads, including charges related to our Market Operations, Global Business Services and Corporate Functions activities. 10. Leases The Company determines whether a contract contains a lease at the inception of a contract by determining if the contract conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. We lease certain real estate, machinery, equipment, vehicles and office equipment for varying periods. Many of these leases include an option to either renew or terminate the lease. For purposes of calculating lease liabilities, these options are included within the lease term when it has become reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options. The incremental borrowing rate utilized to calculate our lease liabilities is based on the information available at commencement date, as most of the leases do not provide an implicit borrowing rate. The Company does not have any material financing lease or sublease activities. The Company incurred lease expense for operating leases of $ 88 and $ 173 for the three and six months ended December 31, 2019, respectively. Total cash paid related to leases during the three and six months ended December 31, 2019 was $ 74 and $ 145 , respectively, including amounts expensed and amounts capitalized. Short-term leases, defined as leases with initial terms of 12 months or less, are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Lease expense for such short-term leases is not material. The most significant assets in our leasing portfolio relate to real estate and vehicles. For purposes of calculating lease liabilities for such leases, we have combined lease and non-lease components. The right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new lease liabilities were $ 19 and $ 28 for the three and six months ended December 31, 2019, respectively. Supplemental balance sheet and other information related to leases is as follows: December 31, 2019 Operating leases: Other noncurrent assets $ 903 Accrued and other liabilities 251 Other noncurrent liabilities 676 Total operating lease liabilities $ 927 Weighted average remaining lease term: Operating leases 6.5 years Weighted average discount rate: Operating leases 4.6 % Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. At December 31, 2019, future payments of operating lease liabilities were as follows: Operating Leases December 31, 2019 1 year $ 251 2 years 200 3 years 163 4 years 139 5 years 105 Over 5 years 215 Total lease payments 1,073 Less: Interest ( 146 ) Present value of lease liabilities $ 927 As of June 30, 2019, minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases by fiscal year were expected to be: Operating Leases June 30, 2019 2020 $ 263 2021 209 2022 165 2023 141 2024 121 After 2024 244 Total lease payments $ 1,143 11. Commitments and Contingencies Litigation We are subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental, patent and trademark matters, labor and employment matters and tax. While considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management and our counsel, the ultimate resolution of the various lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior manufacturing and waste disposal practices. Based on currently available information, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of environmental remediation will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Income Tax Uncertainties The Company is present in approximately 70 countries and over 150 taxable jurisdictions and, at any point in time, has 40 – 50 jurisdictional audits underway at various stages of completion. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite our belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitations. Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate. We have tax years open ranging from 2008 and forward. We are generally not able to reliably estimate the ultimate settlement amounts until the close of the audit. Based on information currently available, we anticipate that over the next 12 month period, audit activity could be completed related to uncertain tax positions in multiple jurisdictions for which we have accrued existing liabilities of approximately $ 146 , including interest and penalties. Additional information on the Commitments and Contingencies of the Company can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2019. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. 12. Merck Acquisition On November 30, 2018, we completed our acquisition of the OTC healthcare business of Merck KGaA (Merck OTC) for $ 3.7 billion (based on exchange rates at the time of closing) in an all-cash transaction. This business primarily sells OTC consumer healthcare products, mainly in Europe, Latin America and Asia markets. The results of Merck OTC, which are not material to the Company, are reported in our consolidated financial statements beginning December 1, 2018. During the current period, we completed the allocation of the purchase price to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The allocation is based on the final determination of fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired. The following table presents the allocation of purchase price related to the Merck OTC business as of the date of the acquisition: Amounts in millions November 30, 2018 Current assets $ 421 Property, plant and equipment 119 Intangible assets 2,134 Goodwill 2,083 Other non-current assets 209 Total assets acquired $ 4,966 Current liabilities $ 232 Deferred income taxes 763 Non-current liabilities 94 Total liabilities acquired $ 1,089 Noncontrolling interest (1) $ 169 Net assets acquired $ 3,708 (1) Represents a 48 % minority ownership interest in the Merck India company. The acquisition resulted in $ 2.1 billion in goodwill, of which approximately $ 180 million is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. All of this goodwill was allocated to the Health Care reportable segment. The fair value of Merck OTC’s identifiable intangible assets is $ 2.1 billion. The allocation of identifiable intangible assets and their average useful lives is as follows: Amounts in millions Estimated Fair Value Avg Remaining Useful Life Intangible assets with determinable lives Brands $ 701 14 Patents and technology 162 10 Customer relationships 325 20 Total $ 1,188 15 Intangible assets with indefinite lives Brands 946 Total intangible assets $ 2,134 The majority of the acquired intangible assets relate to brand intangibles. Our assessment as to brand intangibles that have an indefinite life and those that have a definite life was based on a number of factors, including competitive environment, market share, brand history, product life cycles, operating plan and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. The indefinite-lived brand intangibles include Neurobion and Dolo Neurobion. The definite-lived brand intangibles primarily include regional or local brands. The definite-lived brand intangibles have estimated lives ranging from 10 to 20 years. The technology intangibles are related to R&D and manufacturing know-how. The customer relationships intangibles are related to Merck OTC’s relationships with health care professionals, retailers and distributors. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified.

A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected herein, is included in the section titled “Economic Conditions and Uncertainties” of this Form 10-Q and the section titled ""Risk Factors"" (Part I, Item 1A) of the Company's Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2019. The purpose of Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is to provide an understanding of Procter & Gamble's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. The MD&A is organized in the following sections: • Overview • Summary of Results – Six Months Ended December 31, 2019 • Economic Conditions and Uncertainties • Results of Operations – Three and Six Months Ended December 31, 2019 • Business Segment Discussion – Three and Six Months Ended December 31, 2019 • Liquidity and Capital Resources • Reconciliation of Measures Not Defined by U.S. GAAP Throughout the MD&A, we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales and net earnings. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), consisting of organic sales growth, core net earnings per share (Core EPS), adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity. The explanation at the end of the MD&A provides the definition of these non-GAAP measures, details on the use and the derivation of these measures, as well as reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures. Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and market consumption in the MD&A are based on a combination of vendor purchased traditional brick-and-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales of our products in dollar terms on a constant currency basis, relative to all product sales in the category. The Company measures fiscal year to date market shares through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months as compared to the end of the reporting period. OVERVIEW P&G is a global leader in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories, primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, high-frequency stores and pharmacies. We also sell direct to consumers. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries. Our market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position. The table below provides detail on our reportable segments, including the product categories and brand composition within each segment. Reportable Segments Product Categories (Sub-Categories) Major Brands Beauty Hair Care ( Conditioner, Shampoo, Styling Aids, Treatments ) Head & Shoulders, Herbal Essences, Pantene, Rejoice Skin and Personal Care ( Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Personal Cleansing, Skin Care ) Olay, Old Spice, Safeguard, SK-II, Secret Grooming Grooming (1) (Shave Care - Female Blades & Razors, Male Blades & Razors, Pre- and Post-Shave Products, Other Shave Care; Appliances) Braun, Gillette, Venus Health Care Oral Care ( Toothbrushes, Toothpaste, Other Oral Care ) Crest, Oral-B Personal Health Care ( Gastrointestinal, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements, Pain Relief, Other Personal Health Care ) Metamucil, Neurobion, Pepto Bismol, Vicks Fabric & Home Care Fabric Care ( Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Additives, Laundry Detergents ) Ariel, Downy, Gain, Tide Home Care ( Air Care, Dish Care, P&G Professional, Surface Care ) Cascade, Dawn, Fairy, Febreze, Mr. Clean, Swiffer Baby, Feminine & Family Care Baby Care ( Baby Wipes, Taped Diapers and Pants ) Luvs, Pampers Feminine Care ( Adult Incontinence, Feminine Care ) Always, Always Discreet, Tampax Family Care ( Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper ) Bounty, Charmin, Puffs (1) The Grooming product category is comprised of the Shave Care and Appliances operating segments. The following table provides the percentage of net sales and net earnings by reportable business segment for the three and six months ended December 31, 2019 (excluding net sales and net earnings in Corporate): Three Months Ended December 31, 2019 Six Months Ended December 31, 2019 Net Sales Net Earnings Net Sales Net Earnings Beauty 20% 23% 20% 24% Grooming 9% 11% 9% 11% Health Care 14% 16% 13% 13% Fabric & Home Care 32% 27% 32% 28% Baby, Feminine & Family Care 25% 23% 26% 24% Total Company 100% 100% 100% 100% SUMMARY OF RESULTS Following are highlights of results for the six months ended December 31, 2019 versus the six months ended December 31, 2018: • Net sales increased 6% to $36.0 billion, driven by a high teens increase in Health Care, a high single digits increase in Beauty, mid-single digits increase in Fabric & Home Care and low single digits increase in Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Grooming net sales were unchanged. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, increased 6%, driven by high single digits increases in Beauty and Health Care, mid-single digits increase in Fabric & Home Care and low single digits increases in Baby, Feminine & Family Care and Grooming. • Unit volume increased 4% , with organic volume up 3%. Volume increased mid-teens in Health Care, mid-single digits in Beauty and in Fabric & Home Care and low single digits in Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Grooming volume was unchanged. Excluding the impacts of the Merck OTC acquisition, organic volume increased mid-single digits in Health Care. • Net earnings were $7.4 billion, an increase of $0.9 billion or 15% versus the prior year period due to the increase in net sales, an increase in operating margin and a reduction in the current period income tax rate, partially offset by the base period gain on dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership. • Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $0.9 billion or 14% versus the prior year period to $7.3 billion . • Diluted net earnings per share increased 14% to 2.77 due primarily to the increase in net earnings. • Core net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble, which represents net earnings excluding incremental restructuring charges in both periods and the base period gain on the dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership, increased 19% to $7.4 billion. Core net earnings per share increased 18% to $2.79 due primarily to the increase in Core net earnings. • Operating cash flow was $8.5 billion. Adjusted free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less capital expenditures and certain other impacts, was $7.1 billion. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 96%. ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES Global Economic Conditions . Our products are sold in numerous countries across North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa with more than half our sales generated outside the United States. As such, we are exposed to and impacted by global macroeconomic factors, U.S. and foreign government policies and foreign exchange fluctuations. Current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic, and any causes of market size contraction, such as reduced GDP in commodity-dependent economies, greater political unrest or instability in the Middle East, Central & Eastern Europe, certain Latin American markets, the Hong Kong market in Greater China and the Korean peninsula, economic uncertainty related to the execution of the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, and overall economic slowdowns, could reduce our sales or erode our operating margin, in either case reducing our earnings. Changes in Costs . Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, transportation costs and our own productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities, in particular, certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp, and volatility in the market price of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs. If we are unable to manage commodity fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions, as well as through consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our gross margin, operating margin and net earnings. Sales could also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on consumption of our products. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including outsourcing projects, supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. As discussed later in this MD&A, in 2012 we initiated overhead and supply chain cost improvement projects. In fiscal 2017, we communicated specific elements of an additional multi-year cost reduction program which is resulting in enrollment reductions and other savings. If we are not successful in executing and sustaining these changes, there could be a negative impact on our operating margin and net earnings. Foreign Exchange . We have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates. Translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation of transaction-related working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. In four of the past five fiscal years, as well as the current year, the U.S. dollar has strengthened versus a number of foreign currencies, leading to lower sales and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts. Certain countries experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations, like Argentina, Brazil, Greater China and the United Kingdom have previously had, and could in the future have, a significant impact on our sales, costs and earnings. Increased pricing in response to certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could also have a negative impact on consumption of our products, which would affect our sales and profits. Government Policies . Our net earnings could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government tax policies, for example, the U.S. Tax Act enacted in December 2017, and the current work being led by the OECD for the G20 focused on ""Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy."" The breadth of this project extends beyond pure digital businesses and is likely to impact all multinational businesses by redefining jurisdictional taxing rights. Additionally, we attempt to carefully manage our debt, currency and other exposures in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and pricing controls, such as Nigeria, Algeria, Egypt, Argentina and Turkey. Further, our earnings and sales could be affected by changes to international trade agreements in North America and elsewhere, including increases of import tariffs, both currently effective and potential future changes. Changes in government policies in these areas might cause an increase or decrease in our sales, operating margin and net earnings. For information on risk factors that could impact our results, please refer to “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Three Months Ended December 31, 2019 The following discussion provides a review of results for the three months ended December 31, 2019 versus the three months ended December 31, 2018. Three Months Ended December 31 Amounts in millions, except per share amounts 2019 2018 % Chg Net sales $18,240 $17,438 5% Operating income 4,482 3,896 15% Net earnings 3,743 3,216 16% Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 3,717 3,194 16% Diluted net earnings per common share 1.41 1.22 16% Core net earnings per common share 1.42 1.25 14% Three Months Ended December 31 COMPARISONS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES 2019 2018 Basis Pt Chg Gross margin 51.4% 48.9% 250 Selling, general & administrative expense 26.8% 26.5% 30 Operating income 24.6% 22.3% 230 Earnings before income taxes 24.8% 22.5% 230 Net earnings 20.5% 18.4% 210 Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 20.4% 18.3% 210 Net Sales Net sales for the quarter increased 5% to $18.2 billion including a 1% negative impact from foreign exchange. Unit volume increased 3%. Excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures, organic volume also increased 3%. Increased pricing had a 1% favorable impact to net sales. Mix was a 1% positive impact to net sales, driven by disproportionate organic growth of the Health Care segment and the Skin & Personal Care category, both of which have higher than company average selling prices. Volume increased double digits in Health Care, increased mid-single digits in Beauty and increased low single digits in Fabric & Home Care and in Grooming. Volume was unchanged in Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Excluding the impacts of the Merck OTC acquisition, Health Care organic volume increased mid-single digits. On a regional basis, volume growth was driven by mid-single digits increases in Greater China, Europe and Latin America and low single digits increases in North America, and India, Middle East and Africa (IMEA). Volume was unchanged in Asia Pacific. Excluding the impact of Merck OTC acquisition, organic volume increased low single digits in Latin America. Organic sales increased 5% on a 3% increase in organic volume.

(2) Other includes the sales mix impact from acquisitions and divestitures and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile volume to net sales. Operating Costs Gross margin increased 250 basis points to 51.4% of net sales for the quarter. Gross margin benefited from: • 120 basis points of gross manufacturing cost savings projects (110 basis points net of product and packaging reinvestments), • 70 basis points of lower commodity costs, • 40 basis points of positive pricing impacts, • 50 basis points of lower restructuring costs, and • 30 basis points of other benefits These benefits were partially offset by a 10 basis-point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange and a 40 basis point decline from unfavorable product mix (primarily mix within segments due to the growth of lower margin product forms and large sizes in certain categories). Total SG&A spending increased 6% to $4.9 billion due to increases in marketing spending, overhead costs and other operating costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased 30 basis points to 26.8% due to an increase in marketing spending and other operating costs as a percentage of net sales. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales increased 20 basis points as the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and savings in agency compensation, production costs and advertising spending were more than offset by reinvestments in media. Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales were unchanged as the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and productivity savings were offset by inflation, higher incentive compensation costs and other cost increases. Other net operating costs as a percentage of net sales increased marginally. Productivity-driven cost savings delivered 100 basis points of benefit in SG&A. Non-Operating Expenses and Income Interest expense was $100 million for the quarter, a decrease of $38 million versus the prior year period due to a decrease in average debt balances and a reduction in US interest rates. Interest income was $36 million for the quarter, a $27 million decrease versus the prior year period due to lower investment securities balances and reduced US interest rates. Other non-operating income was $114 million, an increase of $19 million due to an increase in gains from minor brand divestitures in the current period. Income Taxes For the three months ended December 31, 2019, the effective tax rate decreased 50 basis points versus the prior year period to 17.4% due to: • a 120 basis-point reduction from a non-recurring tax benefit arising from a simplification of our legal entity structure and, • a 70 basis-point reduction from favorable impacts from geographic mix of earnings, These reductions are partially offset by: • a 90 basis-point increase from reduced excess tax benefits of share-based compensation (80 basis-point reduction in the current period versus 170 basis-point reduction in the prior year period) and, • a 50 basis-point increase from discrete impacts related to uncertain tax positions (40 basis-point reduction in the current period versus 90 basis-point reduction in the prior year period). Net Earnings Operating income increased $586 million, or 15% to $4.5 billion due to the net sales increase and the increase in gross margins, partially offset by the increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales, all of which are described above. Net earnings increased $527 million or 16% to $3.7 billion primarily due to the increase in operating income. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of $40 million on net earnings for the quarter, including both transactional charges and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars. Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $523 million or 16% to $3.7 billion for the quarter. Diluted net earnings per share increased 16% to $1.41. Core net earnings per share increased 14% to $1.42. Core net earnings per share represents diluted net earnings per share, excluding the incremental restructuring charges in both periods related to our productivity and cost savings plans. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Six Months Ended December 31, 2019 The following discussion provides a review of results for the six months ended December 31, 2019 versus the six months ended December 31, 2018. Six Months Ended December 31 Amounts in millions, except per share amounts 2019 2018 % Chg Net sales $36,038 $34,128 6% Operating income 8,772 7,450 18% Net earnings 7,360 6,427 15% Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 7,310 6,393 14% Diluted net earnings per common share 2.77 2.44 14% Core net earnings per common share 2.79 2.36 18% Six Months Ended December 31 COMPARISONS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES 2019 2018 Basis Pt Chg Gross margin 51.2% 49.0% 220 Selling, general & administrative expense 26.8% 27.2% (40) Operating income 24.3% 21.8% 250 Earnings before income taxes 24.6% 23.0% 160 Net earnings 20.4% 18.8% 160 Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 20.3% 18.7% 160 Net Sales Net sales for the six months ended December 31, 2019 increased 6% to $36.0 billion including a 1% negative impact from foreign exchange. Unit volume increased 4%. Excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures, organic volume increased 3%. Increased pricing had a 1% favorable impact to net sales. Mix was a 2% positive impact to net sales, driven primarily by disproportionate organic growth of the Health Care segment and the Skin & Personal Care category, both of which have higher than company average selling prices. Volume increased mid-teens in Health Care, increased mid-single digits in Fabric & Home Care and Beauty and increased low single digits in Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Volume was unchanged in Grooming. Excluding the impacts of the Merck OTC acquisition, Health Care organic volume increased mid-single digits. All regions grew volume led by mid-single digits increases in Europe, Greater China, Asia Pacific and Latin America, along with low single digit increases in North America and IMEA. Excluding the impact of minor acquisitions and divestitures, organic volume increased low single digits in Europe. Organic sales increased 6% on a 3% increase in organic volume.

Operating Costs Gross margin increased 220 basis points to 51.2% of net sales for the six months ended December 31, 2019. Gross margin benefited from: • 100 basis points of gross manufacturing cost savings projects (90 basis points net of product and packaging reinvestments), • 60 basis points of positive pricing impacts, • 60 basis points of lower commodity costs, • 20 basis points from lower restructuring costs, and • 10 basis points of other benefits These benefits were partially offset by a 10 basis-point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange and a 10 basis point net decline from unfavorable product mix (primarily mix within segments due to the growth of lower margin product forms and large sizes in certain categories and due to the disproportionate growth of the Fabric Care category which is one of our largest categories and has lower than company average margins). Total SG&A spending increased 4% to $9.7 billion due to increases in marketing spending and overhead costs, partially offset by a reduction in other operating costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 40 basis points to 26.8% due to a decrease in overhead and other operating costs as a percentage of net sales. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales was unchanged as the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and savings in agency compensation, production costs and advertising spending, were offset by reinvestments in media and other marketing spending. Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales decreased 10 basis points driven by the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase, productivity savings and lower restructuring charges versus the base period, partially offset by inflation, higher incentive compensation costs and other cost increases. Other net operating costs as a percentage of net sales decreased 20 basis points primarily due to gains from legal settlements. Productivity-driven cost savings delivered 90 basis points of benefit in SG&A. Non-Operating Expenses and Income Interest expense was $208 million for the six months ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $59 million versus the prior year period due to a decrease in average debt balances and a reduction in U.S. interest rates. Interest income was $94 million for the six months ended December 31, 2019, a decrease of $22 million versus the prior year period due to a decrease in investment securities balances and a reduction in U.S. interest rates. Other non-operating income was $217 million, a decrease of $340 million due to the base period gain from the dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership. Income Taxes For the six months ended December 31, 2019, the effective tax rate decreased 110 basis points versus the prior year period to 17.1% due to: • a 120 basis-point reduction from a non-recurring tax benefit arising from a simplification of our legal entity structure, • a 50 basis-point reduction from favorable impacts from geographic mix of earnings and, • a 30 basis-point reduction from increased excess tax benefits of share-based compensation (140 basis-point reduction in the current year versus 110 basis-point reduction in the prior year), These reductions are offset by: • an 80 basis-point increase related to the prior year tax impact of the gain on the dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership and, • a 10 basis-point increase from discrete impacts related to uncertain tax positions (10 basis-point reduction in the current year versus 20 basis-point reduction in the prior year). Net Earnings Operating income increased $1.3 billion, or 18% to $8.8 billion due to the net sales increase, the increase in gross margins and the reduction in SG&A as a percentage of sales, all of which are described above. Net earnings increased $933 million or 15% to $7.4 billion for the fiscal year to date period, due to the increase in operating income and the lower tax rates as described above, partially offset by the base period gain on the PGT Healthcare partnership dissolution. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of $90 million on net earnings for the quarter, including both transactional charges and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars. Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $917 million or 14% to $7.3 billion for the fiscal year to date period. Diluted net earnings per share increased 14% to $2.77. Core net earnings per share increased 18% to $2.79. Core net earnings per share represents diluted net earnings per share excluding the incremental restructuring charges in both periods related to our productivity and cost savings plans and the gain on dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership in the base period. BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSION – Three and Six Months Ended December 31, 2019 The following discussion provides a review of results by reportable business segment. Analysis of the results for the three and six month periods ended December 31, 2019 is provided based on a comparison to the same three and six months period ended December 31, 2018. The primary financial measures used to evaluate segment performance are net sales and net earnings. The table below provides supplemental information on net sales and net earnings by reportable business segment for the three and six months ended December 31, 2019 versus the comparable prior year period (dollar amounts in millions): Three Months Ended December 31, 2019 Net Sales % Change Versus Year Ago Earnings/(Loss) Before Income Taxes % Change Versus Year Ago Net Earnings % Change Versus Year Ago Beauty $ 3,598 7 % $ 1,072 11 % $ 858 11 % Grooming 1,648 2 % 494 10 % 411 9 % Health Care 2,530 14 % 732 9 % 571 10 % Fabric & Home Care 5,787 4 % 1,278 13 % 975 13 % Baby, Feminine & Family Care 4,582 1 % 1,076 16 % 822 16 % Corporate 95 N/A (120) N/A 106 N/A Total Company $ 18,240 5 % $ 4,532 16 % $ 3,743 16 % Six Months Ended December 31, 2019 Net Sales % Change Versus Year Ago Earnings/(Loss) Before Income Taxes % Change Versus Year Ago Net Earnings % Change Versus Year Ago Beauty $ 7,150 8 % $ 2,164 13 % $ 1,732 13 % Grooming 3,179 — % 920 6 % 764 6 % Health Care 4,751 17 % 1,272 15 % 972 14 % Fabric & Home Care 11,619 5 % 2,616 15 % 2,003 15 % Baby, Feminine & Family Care 9,149 2 % 2,210 21 % 1,693 21 % Corporate 190 N/A (307) N/A 196 N/A Total Company $ 36,038 6 % $ 8,875 13 % $ 7,360 15 % Beauty Three months ended December 31, 2019 compared with three months ended December 31, 2018 Beauty net sales increased 7% to $3.6 billion during the second fiscal quarter on a 5% increase in unit volume. Favorable product mix added 1% to net sales due to the disproportionate growth of the Skin and Personal Care category, including the Olay Skincare brand, which has higher than segment average selling prices. Higher pricing increased net sales by 2%. Unfavorable foreign exchange impacts reduced net sales by 1%. Organic sales increased 8%. Global market share of the Beauty segment decreased 0.2 points. Volume growth was driven by a double digit increase in Greater China, high single digits increase in Europe, mid-single digits increase in Asia Pacific and a low single digit increases in Latin America and IMEA. Volume in North America was unchanged. • Volume in Hair Care increased low single digits. Increased volume was driven by high single digits growth in Europe and Asia Pacific and mid-single digits growth in Greater China (due to product innovation, market growth and retailer inventory increase to support promotion and innovation launch), partially offset by a low single digits decline in North America due to market decline. Global market share of the Hair Care category decreased slightly. • Volume in Skin and Personal Care increased high single digits. Volume increase was primarily driven by a more than 20% increase in Greater China and a double digit increase in Latin America, along with a high single digits increase in Europe. Volume growth was driven by premium innovation, market growth and retailer inventory increase to support promotion activity. Global market share of the Skin and Personal Care category increased slightly. Net earnings increased 11% to $858 million due to the increase in net sales and an 80 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. The net earnings margin increased primarily due to a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of sales, partially offset by a reduction in gross margin. The gross margin decrease was primarily driven by hurts related to new manufacturing startup costs and the negative impacts of unfavorable mix, due to the disproportionate growth of large sizes, partially offset by increased pricing. The reduction in SG&A as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase. Six months ended December 31, 2019 compared with six months ended December 31, 2018 Beauty fiscal year to date net sales increased 8% to $7.2 billion on a 4% increase in unit volume. Favorable product mix added 3% to net sales due to the disproportionate growth of the Skin and Personal Care category, including the Olay and SKII Skincare brands, which have higher than segment average selling prices. Higher pricing increased net sales by 2%. Unfavorable foreign exchange impacts reduced net sales by 1%. Organic sales increased 9%. Global market share of the Beauty segment was unchanged. Volume grew in all regions led by mid-single digit increases in Greater China, Europe and Asia Pacific, along with low single digit increases in North America, Latin America and IMEA. • Volume in Hair Care increased low single digits. Increased volume was driven by mid-single digits growth in Europe and Asia Pacific and a low single digits increase in Latin America, North America, Greater China and IMEA (due to product innovation and market growth). Global market share of the Hair Care category was unchanged. • Volume in Skin and Personal Care increased high single digits. Excluding the impact of minor brand acquisitions, organic volume increased mid-single digits. Volume growth was driven by a high teens increase in Greater China, a high single digits increase in Latin America, a mid-single digits increase in Europe and low single digit increases in North America and Asia Pacific. Volume growth was driven by premium innovation and market growth. Global market share of the Skin and Personal Care category increased less than half a point. Net earnings increased 13% to $1.7 billion due to the increase in net sales and a 120 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. The net earnings margin increased primarily due to a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of sales, partially offset by a decrease in gross margin. The gross margin decrease was primarily driven by the negative impacts of unfavorable mix due to the disproportionate growth of large sizes and other hurts related to new manufacturing startup costs, partially offset by increased pricing. The reduction in SG&A as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase. Grooming Three months ended December 31, 2019 compared with three months ended December 31, 2018 Grooming net sales increased 2% to $1.6 billion during the second fiscal quarter on a 2% increase in unit volume. Unfavorable foreign exchange had a negative 2% impact on net sales. Pricing had a positive 2% impact on net sales. Organic sales increased 4%. Global market share of the Grooming segment increased 0.3 points. The volume increase was driven by a mid-teens growth in Asia Pacific, a mid-single digits increase in IMEA and low single digits growth in Europe partially offset by a high single digits decline in Greater China and a low single digits decline in North America. • Shave Care volume increased low single digits. The volume increase was driven by a high teens increase in Asia Pacific, mid-single digits increase in IMEA and a low single digits increase in Europe, all due to product innovation, partially offset by a high single digits decrease in Greater China and a low single digits decrease in North America due to competitive activity. Global market share of the Shave Care category increased slightly. • Volume in Appliances increased low single digits. A mid-single digits increase in North America and a low single digits increase in Europe, both due to innovation was partially offset by a high single digits decline in IMEA and a mid-single digits decline in Greater China due to competitive activity. Global market share of the Appliances category increased a point. Net earnings increased 9% to $411 million due to the increase in net sales and a 150 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin increased primarily due to a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales and a marginal increase in gross margin. Gross margin increased marginally as the positive impacts of manufacturing cost savings and increased pricing were largely offset by the negative impact of unfavorable mix (due to the disproportionate growth of disposable razor products and Asia Pacific and IMEA regions which have lower than segment average margins). SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to a reduction in overhead costs driven by productivity savings and the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase. Six months ended December 31, 2019 compared with six months ended December 31, 2018 Grooming fiscal year to date net sales was unchanged at $3.2 billion on a 1% increase in unit volume. Unfavorable foreign exchange had a negative 2% impact on net sales. Pricing had a positive 2% impact on net sales. Unfavorable mix impact reduced net sales by 1% due to the disproportionate growth of Asia Pacific and IMEA regions which have lower than segment average selling prices. Organic sales increased 2%. Global market share of the Grooming segment decreased 0.1 points. A mid-single digits volume increase in Asia Pacific and a low single digits increase in Europe and IMEA was offset by a mid-single digits decline in North America and a low single digits decline in Greater China. • Shave Care volume increased low single digits. The volume increase was driven by a double digit increase in Asia Pacific and low single digits increases in Europe and IMEA due to product innovation, partially offset by a mid-single digits decline in North America due to competitive activity. Global market share of the Shave Care category was unchanged. • Volume in Appliances decreased low single digits. A double digit decline in Asia Pacific (due to market contraction, competitive activities and a reduction in trade inventories), was partially offset by low single digits volume increases in North America and Europe due to innovation. Global market share of the Appliances category increased more than half a point. Net earnings increased 6% to $0.8 billion due to a 140 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin increased primarily due to a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by a reduction in gross margin. Gross margin declined due to the negative impact of unfavorable mix (due to the disproportionate growth of disposable razor products and Asia Pacific and IMEA regions which have lower than segment average margins), partially offset by the positive impacts of manufacturing cost savings and increased pricing. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to a favorable legal settlement in the current period and a reduction in overhead costs due to productivity savings. Health Care Three months ended December 31, 2019 compared with three months ended December 31, 2018 Health Care net sales increased 14% to $2.5 billion during the second fiscal quarter on a 11% increase in unit volume. Excluding the impact of the Merck OTC consumer healthcare acquisition, organic sales increased 7% and organic volume increased 5%. Unfavorable foreign exchange impacts decreased net sales by 1%. Pricing had a 1% positive impact to net sales for the quarter. Favorable mix increased net sales by 1% due to the disproportionate organic growth of the Personal Health Care category and premium oral care products which have higher than segment average selling prices. Global market share of the Health Care segment increased 0.3 points. The volume increase was led by over 20% growth in Latin America and IMEA, mid-teens growth in Asia Pacific and double digit growth in Europe, along with mid-single digits growth in North America, partially offset by a low single digits decline in Greater China. Excluding the impact of the Merck OTC consumer healthcare acquisition, organic volume increased mid-teens in IMEA, increased high single digits in Latin America and increased mid-single digits in Europe and in Asia Pacific. • Oral Care volume increased mid-single digits. Innovation and market growth drove over 20% volume increase in IMEA, high single digits growth in Latin America and Asia Pacific and low single digits growth in North America and Europe. This was partially offset by a low single digits volume decrease in Greater China due to competitive activities. Excluding the impacts of minor brand divestitures, organic volume increased mid-single digits in Europe. Global market share of the Oral Care category increased less than half a point. • Volume in Personal Health Care increased more than 20% versus the prior year period. Excluding the impact of the Merck OTC consumer healthcare acquisition, organic volume increased mid-single digits. The organic volume increase was driven by high single digits growth in Latin America and IMEA and mid-single digits growth in North America due to innovation and increased marketing spending. Global market share of the Personal Health Care category increased more than half a point. Net earnings increased 10% to $571 million, due to the increase in net sales, partially offset by a 90 basis-points decrease in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin decreased due to an increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by an increase in gross margin. The increase in gross margin was driven by the positive impacts of manufacturing cost savings and increased pricing, partially offset by unfavorable mix impact due to the disproportionate organic growth of certain markets in IMEA with lower than segment average margins. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to an increase in overheads, marketing spending and other operating expenses primarily caused by the Merck OTC consumer healthcare acquisition, partially offset by the positive scale benefits of the net sales increase. Six months ended December 31, 2019 compared with six months ended December 31, 2018 Health Care fiscal year to date net sales increased 17% to $4.8 billion on a 14% increase in unit volume. Excluding the impact of the Merck OTC consumer healthcare acquisition, organic sales increased 8% and organic volume increased 5%. Unfavorable foreign exchange impacts decreased net sales by 2%. Higher pricing increased net sales by 1%. Favorable mix increased net sales by 2% due to the disproportionate organic growth of the Personal Health Care category and premium oral care products which have higher than segment average margins. Global market share of the Health Care segment increased 0.3 points. Volume increase was led by over 20% growth in Latin America and IMEA, high teens growth in Europe and Asia Pacific and mid-single digits growth in North America, partially offset by low single digits decrease in Greater China. Excluding the impact of the Merck OTC consumer healthcare acquisition, organic volume increased double digits in IMEA, increased high single digits in Latin America, increased mid-single digits in Europe and increased low single digits in Asia Pacific. • Oral Care volume increased mid-single digits. Increased volume was driven by over 20% growth in IMEA, high single digits growth in Latin America and Asia Pacific, mid-single digits growth in North America and low single digits growth in Europe due to innovation and market growth. This was partially offset by a low single digits volume decrease in Greater China due to competitive activities. Global market share of the Oral Care category increased less than half a point. • Volume in Personal Health Care increased more than 20% versus the prior period. Excluding the impact of the Merck OTC consumer healthcare acquisition, organic volume increased mid-single digits. The organic volume increase was driven by high single digits growth in North America and Europe and mid-single digits growth in Latin America and IMEA (due to innovation and increased marketing spending), partially offset by high single digits volume decline in Asia Pacific due to devaluation-related price increases. Global market share of the Personal Health Care category increased nearly half a point. Net earnings increased 14% to $1.0 billion, due to the increase in net sales, partially offset by 50 basis-points decrease in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin decreased due to an increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales, partially offset by an increase in gross margin. The increase in gross margin was driven primarily by the positive impacts of increased pricing and manufacturing cost savings. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to an increase in overheads, marketing spending and other operating expenses primarily caused by the Merck OTC consumer healthcare acquisition, partially offset by the positive scale benefits of the net sales increase. Fabric & Home Care Three months ended December 31, 2019 compared with three months ended December 31, 2018 Fabric & Home Care net sales increased 4% to $5.8 billion during the second fiscal quarter on a 3% increase in unit volume. Unfavorable foreign exchange impacts reduced net sales by 1%. Higher pricing had a 1% positive impact to net sales. Positive mix impacts increased net sales by 1% due to the disproportionate growth of the Home Care category and premium products, including unit dose laundry and fabric enhancers, all of which have higher than segment average prices. Organic sales increased 5%. Global market share of the Fabric & Home Care segment increased 0.8 points. Volume growth was driven by high single digit increases in Latin America and Greater China and mid-single digit increases in North America and Europe, partially offset by a mid-single digit decrease in Asia Pacific. The volume decrease in Asia Pacific was partially driven by the previous quarter increase in retailer inventories in Japan prior to the October 2019 VAT increase. • Fabric Care volume increased low single digits. Increased volume was driven by double digits growth in Latin America, high single digits growth in Greater China and mid-single digits growth in North America and in Europe, all due to product innovation. This was partially offset by a mid-single digits decline in Asia Pacific due to the aforementioned Japan retailer inventory increase in the previous quarter and competitive activities. Global market share of the Fabric Care category increased more than half a point. • Home Care volume increased mid-single digits. Increased volume was driven by high single digits growth in Europe and IMEA, along with low single digits growth in North America and Asia Pacific, all due to product innovation. Global market share of the Home Care category increased more than a point. Net earnings increased 13% to $1.0 billion due to the increase in net sales and a 130 basis-points increase in net earnings margin. The net earnings margin increase was primarily due to an increase in gross margin, partially offset by an increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. The gross margin increase was driven by manufacturing cost savings, a reduction in commodity costs and increased pricing, partially offset by unfavorable product mix due to the disproportionate growth of premium innovation that has not yet been cost optimized. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased due to higher marketing spending and overhead costs, partially offset by the positive scale benefits of the net sales increase. Six months ended December 31, 2019 compared with six months ended December 31, 2018 Fabric & Home Care fiscal year to date net sales increased 5% to $11.6 billion on a 5% increase in unit volume. Unfavorable foreign exchange impacts reduced net sales by 1%. Positive mix impacts increased net sales by 1% due to the disproportionate growth of premium products, including unit dose laundry and fabric enhancers. Pricing had no impact to net sales for the period. Organic sales increased 6%. Global market share of the Fabric & Home Care segment increased 0.8 points. Volume increased in all regions led by a double digit increase in Latin America and a high single digits increase in Greater China, along with mid-single digit increases in North America and Europe and low single digit increases in Asia Pacific and IMEA. • Fabric Care volume increased mid-single digits. Volume increased in all regions led by double digits growth in Latin America and high single digits growth in Greater China, along with mid-single digits growth in North America and Europe and low single digits growth in Asia Pacific and IMEA. Volume growth was driven by product innovation. Global market share of the Fabric Care category increased more than half a point. • Home Care volume increased mid-single digits. Increased volume due to product innovation drove high single digits growth in Europe, mid-single digits growth in Asia Pacific and low single digits growth in North America. Global market share of the Home Care category increased more than a point. Net earnings increased 15% to $2.0 billion due to the increase in net sales and a 150 basis-points increase in net earnings margin. The net earnings margin increase was primarily due to an increase in gross margin, along with a marginal reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. The gross margin increase was driven by manufacturing cost savings and reduction in commodity costs. SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales decreased due to the positive scale benefits of the net sales increase. Baby, Feminine & Family Care Three months ended December 31, 2019 compared with three months ended December 31, 2018 Baby, Feminine & Family Care net sales increased 1% to $4.6 billion during the second fiscal quarter on unit volume that was unchanged. Unfavorable foreign exchange impacts decreased net sales by 1%. Positive mix increased net sales by 1% due to the disproportionate growth of premium products, including pants and adult incontinence, and the North America region, which have higher than segment average selling prices. Pricing had no net impact for the quarter. Organic sales increased 1%. Global market share of the Baby, Feminine & Family Care segment decreased 0.5 points. Low single digits volume increases in North America and Greater China were offset by mid-single digit decreases in Asia Pacific, Latin America and IMEA and low single digits decreases in Europe. The volume decrease in Asia Pacific was partially driven by the previous quarter increase in retailer inventories in Japan prior to the October 2019 VAT increase. • Volume in Baby Care decreased mid-single digits. Volume decreased in all regions driven by a double digit decline in Asia Pacific and mid-single digits declines in Europe, IMEA, Latin America and Greater China. These declines were due to competitive activity, devaluation related price increases, category contraction in certain markets and the aforementioned Japan VAT increase impact. Global market share of the Baby Care category decreased more than a point. • Volume in Feminine Care increased low single digits. Volume increased over 20% in Asia Pacific due to a new launch in the adult incontinence category in Japan. Volume increased high single digits in Greater China and mid-single digits in North America and Europe due to product innovation, increased marketing spending and adult incontinence category growth. This was partially offset by a low single digits decline in IMEA due to devaluation-related price increases. Excluding the impact of minor brand acquisitions, organic volume increased low single digits in North America. Global market share of the Feminine Care category increased nearly half a point. • Volume in Family Care, which is predominantly a North American business, increased low single digits driven by product innovation, market growth and increased marketing spending. North America share of the Family Care category decreased slightly. Net earnings increased 16% to $822 million due primarily to a 240 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin increased primarily due to an increase in gross margin, partially offset by an increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin increased due to manufacturing cost savings and a reduction in commodity costs, partially offset by negative mix impacts due to the disproportionate growth of large sizes and product forms with lower than segment-average margins. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to increase in marketing spending as a percentage of sales, partially offset by reduced overhead costs, driven by productivity savings. Six months ended December 31, 2019 compared with six months ended December 31, 2018 Baby, Feminine & Family Care fiscal year to date net sales increased 2% to $9.1 billion on a 1% increase in unit volume. Unfavorable foreign exchange impacts reduced net sales by 1%. Higher pricing increased net sales by 1%. Positive mix increased net sales by 1% due to the disproportionate growth of premium products, including pants and adult incontinence, and the North America region, which have higher than segment average selling prices. Organic sales increased 3%. Global market share of the Baby, Feminine & Family Care segment decreased 0.5 points. Volume growth was driven by low single digit increases in North America, Greater China and Asia Pacific, partially offset by low single digit declines in Europe and Latin America. • Volume in Baby Care decreased low single digits. Volume decreased high single digits in Latin America, mid-single digits in Europe, IMEA, and low single digits in Greater China due to competitive activity, devaluation related price increases and category contraction in certain markets. This was partially offset by low single digit increases in North America and Asia Pacific due to product innovation and market growth. Global market share of the Baby Care category decreased more than a point. • Volume in Feminine Care increased mid-single digits. Excluding the impact of minor brand acquisitions, organic volume increased low single digits. Volume increased in all regions led by high single digits increase in Asia Pacific due to new launch in the adult incontinence category in Japan. Volume increased mid-single digits in Europe, IMEA, Greater China and Latin America and low single digits in North America due to product innovation, increased marketing spending and adult incontinence category growth. Global market share of the Feminine Care category increased less than half a point. • Volume in Family Care, which is predominantly a North American business, increased low single digits driven by product innovation, market growth and increased marketing spending. North America share of the Family Care category decreased less than half a point. Net earnings increased 21% to $1.7 billion due to the increase in net sales and a 290 basis point increase in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin increased due to an increase in gross margin, partially offset by a marginal increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin increased due to manufacturing cost savings projects, increased pricing and a reduction in commodity costs, partially offset by negative mix impacts due to the disproportionate growth of large sizes and product forms with lower than segment-average margins. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased marginally due to an increase in marketing spending as a percentage of sales, partially offset by reduced overhead costs, driven by productivity savings. Corporate Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business segments. These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level; financing and investing activities; certain employee benefit costs; other general corporate items; the gains and losses related to certain divested brands and categories; and certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the reportable segments to U.S. GAAP. The most significant reconciling item includes income taxes to adjust from blended statutory rates that are reflected in the reportable segments to the overall Company effective tax rate. Corporate net sales decreased $34 million to $95 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2019 and decreased $55 million to $190 million for the fiscal year to date. Corporate net earnings improved by $127 million in the quarter primarily due to lower restructuring charges versus the base period, lower interest expense and a decrease in effective tax rates, all of which have been described above. Fiscal year to date Corporate net earnings increased $6 million as lower restructuring charges versus the base period and lower interest expense, lower effective tax rates and lower foreign exchange transactional charges in the current period were largely offset by the base period gain on the dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership. Restructuring Program to deliver Productivity and Cost Savings In 2012, the Company initiated a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs and better leverage scale in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overheads. The plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes to fund the Company's growth strategy. In 2017, the Company communicated specific elements of an additional multi-year productivity and cost savings program. The current productivity and cost savings plan is expected to further reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, certain marketing activities and overhead expenses. As part of this plan, the Company incurred $1.8 billion in total before-tax restructuring costs across fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019, with an additional amount of approximately $0.6 billion expected in fiscal 2020. This program is expected to result in additional targeted enrollment reductions, along with further optimization of the supply chain and other manufacturing processes. Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the resulting charges are funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting. In addition to our restructuring programs, we have additional ongoing savings efforts in our supply chain, marketing and overhead areas that have and are expected to continue to yield additional benefits to our operating margins. Refer to Note 9 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the restructuring program. LIQUIDITY & CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating Activities We generated $8.5 billion of cash from operating activities fiscal year to date, an increase of $959 million versus the prior year. Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, deferred income taxes and gain on sale of assets), generated $8.4 billion of operating cash flow. Working capital and other impacts generated $133 million of cash in the period. Accounts receivable increased, using $257 million of cash, primarily due to sales growth. Inventory consumed $533 million of cash primarily to support business growth and product initiatives. Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities increased, generating $958 million of cash primarily due to an increase in taxes payable and to a lesser extent, extended payment terms with our suppliers and to support business growth. Taxes payable increased approximately $650 million, including an approximate $500 million increase related to the integration of Merck, which had no impact on operating cash flows, as there was an equal and offsetting release of a deferred tax liability that was initially created on the acquisition of Merck. All other operating assets and liabilities used $55 million of cash. Investing Activities Investing activities generated $4.4 billion of cash fiscal year to date. Capital expenditures were $1.7 billion, or 4.7% of net sales. We received $6.2 billion of cash from sales and maturities of investment securities. Financing Activities Our financing activities used $10.9 billion of net cash fiscal year to date. We used $6.5 billion for treasury stock purchases, $3.9 billion for dividends and $1.6 billion for debt repayments. Cash from the exercise of stock options and other impacts generated $1.1 billion of cash. As of December 31, 2019, our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $11.2 billion. We have short- and long-term debt to meet our financing needs. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements. RECONCILIATION OF MEASURES NOT DEFINED BY U.S. GAAP In accordance with the SEC's Regulation S-K Item 10(e), the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measures. We believe that these measures provide useful perspective on underlying business results and trends (i.e., trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and provide a supplemental measure of year-on-year results. The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measure, but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted. Organic sales growth: Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. This measure is used in assessing achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. Adjusted free cash flow: Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the comprehensive U.S. legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017 (the U.S. Tax Act). Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. Management views adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments. Adjusted free cash flow productivity: Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings. Management views adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G’s ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. This measure is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. The Company's long-term target is to generate annual adjusted free cash flow productivity at or above 90 percent. Core EPS: Core earnings per share, or Core EPS, is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share adjusted as indicated. Management views this non-GAAP measure as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time. This measure is also used when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation. The Core earnings measures included in the following reconciliation tables refer to the equivalent GAAP measures adjusted as applicable for the following items: Incremental Restructuring: The Company has had and continues to have an ongoing level of restructuring activities. Such activities have resulted in ongoing annual restructuring related charges of approximately $250 - $500 million before tax. In 2012, the Company began a $10 billion strategic productivity and cost savings initiative that included incremental restructuring activities. In 2017, we communicated details of an additional multi-year productivity and cost savings plan. This results in incremental restructuring charges to accelerate productivity efforts and cost savings. The adjustment to Core earnings includes only the restructuring costs above what we believe are the normal recurring level of restructuring costs. Gain on Dissolution of PGT Healthcare Partnership: The Company finalized the dissolution of our PGT Healthcare partnership, a venture between the Company and Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries, Ltd. (Teva) in the OTC consumer healthcare business, in the quarter ended September 30, 2018. The transaction was accounted for as a sale of the Teva portion of the PGT business and resulted in the Company recognizing an after-tax gain on the dissolution of $353 million. We do not view the above items to be part of our sustainable results and their exclusion from Core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results. These items are also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation.

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Basis of Presentation These statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 . In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of The Procter & Gamble Company and subsidiaries (the ""Company,"" ""Procter & Gamble,"" ""P&G,"" ""we"" or ""our"") contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods reported. However, the results of operations included in such financial statements may not necessarily be indicative of annual results. 2. New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies On July 1, 2019, we adopted ASU 2016-02, ""Leases (Topic 842)."" The new accounting standard required the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all long-term leases, including operating leases, on the balance sheet. We elected the optional transition method and adopted the new guidance on a modified retrospective basis with no restatement of prior period amounts. As allowed under the new accounting standard, we elected to apply practical expedients to carry forward the original lease determinations, lease classifications and accounting of initial direct costs for all asset classes at the time of adoption. The adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements, resulting in an increase of approximately 1 % to each of our total assets and total liabilities on our balance sheet as of July 1, 2019. See Note 10 for further information. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, ""Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment."" The standard simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by requiring a goodwill impairment to be measured using a single step impairment model, whereby the impairment equals the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the specified reporting units in their entirety. This eliminates the second step of the current impairment model that requires companies to first estimate the fair value of all assets in a reporting unit and measure impairments based on those fair values and a residual measurement approach. It also specifies that any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We will adopt the standard no later than July 1, 2020. The impact of the new standard will be dependent on the specific facts and circumstances of future individual impairments, if any. No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had, or is expected to have, a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. 3. Segment Information Under U.S. GAAP, our operating segments are aggregated into five reportable segments: 1) Beauty, 2) Grooming, 3) Health Care, 4) Fabric & Home Care and 5) Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Our five reportable segments are comprised of: • Beauty : Hair Care (Conditioner, Shampoo, Styling Aids, Treatments); Skin and Personal Care (Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Personal Cleansing, Skin Care); • Grooming : Shave Care (Female Blades & Razors, Male Blades & Razors, Pre- and Post-Shave Products, Other Shave Care); Appliances • Health Care : Oral Care (Toothbrushes, Toothpaste, Other Oral Care); Personal Health Care (Gastrointestinal, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements, Pain Relief, Other Personal Health Care); • Fabric & Home Care : Fabric Care (Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Additives, Laundry Detergents); Home Care (Air Care, Dish Care, P&G Professional, Surface Care); and • Baby, Feminine & Family Care : Baby Care (Baby Wipes, Taped Diapers and Pants); Feminine Care (Adult Incontinence, Feminine Care); Family Care (Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper). Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. Our operating segments are comprised of similar product categories. Operating segments that individually accounted for 5% or more of consolidated net sales are as follows: % of Net sales by operating segment (1) Three Months Ended September 30 2019 2018 Fabric Care 23 % 23 % Baby Care 11 % 12 % Home Care 10 % 10 % Hair Care 10 % 10 % Skin and Personal Care 10 % 9 % Family Care 9 % 9 % Oral Care 7 % 8 % Shave Care 7 % 8 % Feminine Care 6 % 6 % Personal Health Care 5 % 3 % Other 2 % 2 % Total 100 % 100 % (1) % of Net sales by operating segment excludes sales held in Corporate.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill is allocated by reportable segment as follows: Beauty Grooming Health Care Fabric & Home Care Baby, Feminine & Family Care Total Company Goodwill at June 30, 2019 $ 12,985 $ 12,881 $ 7,972 $ 1,855 $ 4,580 $ 40,273 Acquisitions and divestitures ( 1 ) — ( 53 ) — — ( 54 ) Translation and other ( 222 ) ( 159 ) ( 153 ) ( 18 ) ( 62 ) ( 614 ) Goodwill at September 30, 2019 $ 12,762 $ 12,722 $ 7,766 $ 1,837 $ 4,518 $ 39,605 Goodwill from current year acquisitions and divestitures primarily reflects opening balance sheet adjustments from the prior year acquisition of the over-the-counter (OTC) healthcare business of Merck KGaA (Merck OTC) in the Health Care reportable segment (see Note 12), along with adjustments from a prior year Beauty acquisition. Identifiable intangible assets at September 30, 2019 were comprised of: Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Intangible assets with determinable lives $ 8,452 $ ( 5,443 ) Intangible assets with indefinite lives 20,993 — Total identifiable intangible assets $ 29,445 $ ( 5,443 ) Intangible assets with determinable lives consist of brands, patents, technology and customer relationships. The intangible assets with indefinite lives consist of brands. The amortization expense of determinable lived intangible assets for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 was $ 96 and $ 73 , respectively. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are tested annually for impairment. The test to evaluate goodwill for impairment is a two-step process. In the first step, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a second step (the step two testing) to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. The step two testing of the impairment analysis requires a valuation of a reporting unit's tangible and intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of purchase price in a business combination. If the resulting implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is less than its carrying value, that difference represents an impairment. The business unit valuations used to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment, margin expansion and Company business plans. We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable. However, future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. Our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets occurs during the three months ended December 31. Most of our goodwill reporting units are comprised of a combination of legacy and acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that, at a minimum, exceed two times their underlying carrying values. Certain of our goodwill reporting units, in particular Shave Care and Appliances, are comprised entirely of acquired businesses and as a result, have fair value cushions that are not as high. The Appliances wholly-acquired reporting unit has a fair value that significantly exceeds the underlying carrying value. As previously disclosed, the carrying value of the Shave Care reporting unit and the related Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset were impaired during the year ended June 30, 2019. The underlying reductions in fair values were due in large part to significant currency devaluations in a number of countries relative to the U.S. dollar, a deceleration of category growth caused by changing grooming habits, primarily in the developed markets, and an increased competitive market environment in the U.S. and certain other markets. As a result of the impairment determined by the step two testing, the Shave Care fair value exceeded the carrying value by approximately 20 % as of June 30, 2019. Because the impairment testing for intangible assets is a one step process, the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset fair value approximated its carrying value at that date. As a result, the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset is more susceptible to future impairment risk. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the net sales and earnings growth rates (including residual growth rates) and discount rate. The residual growth rate represents the expected rate at which the reporting unit and Gillette brand are expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period. The residual growth rate utilized in our fair value estimates is consistent with the reporting unit and brand operating plans, and approximates expected long term category market growth rates. The residual growth rate is dependent on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, relative currency exchange rates and business activities that impact market share. As a result, the residual growth rate could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes, devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or an increased competitive environment. The discount rate, which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, such as further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar. Based on developments in the macroeconomic environment during the quarter ended September 30, 2019, the discount rate utilized in our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets during the three months ended December 31 will likely decline, resulting in an increase in the implied fair value estimates. Spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the U.S. While management can and has implemented strategies to address these events, changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that would trigger future impairment charges of the reporting unit's goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. As of September 30, 2019 , the carrying values of the Shave Care goodwill and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset were $ 12.4 billion and $ 14.1 billion , respectively. The table below provides a sensitivity analysis for the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite lived intangible asset, utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the shorter term and residual growth rates and the discount rate, to demonstrate the potential impacts to the estimated fair values. The table below provides, in isolation, the estimated fair value impacts related to a 25 basis point increase to discount rate or a 25 basis point decrease to our shorter-term and residual growth rates. Approximate Percent Change in Estimated Fair Value +25 bps Discount Rate -25 bps Growth Rate Shave Care goodwill reporting unit ( 5 )% ( 6 )% Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset ( 5 )% ( 5 )% Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. 5. Earnings Per Share Basic net earnings per common share are calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble less preferred dividends by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net earnings per common share are calculated using the treasury stock method, on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of stock options and other stock-based awards and the assumed conversion of preferred stock. Net earnings per share were as follows: CONSOLIDATED AMOUNTS Three Months Ended September 30 2019 2018 Net earnings $ 3,617 $ 3,211 Less: Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 24 12 Net earnings attributable to P&G (Diluted) 3,593 3,199 Preferred dividends ( 65 ) ( 66 ) Net earnings attributable to P&G available to common shareholders (Basic) $ 3,528 $ 3,133 SHARES IN MILLIONS Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 2,504.0 2,495.8 Add: Effect of dilutive securities Conversion of preferred shares (1) 87.4 91.9 Impact of stock options and other unvested equity awards (2) 56.1 24.4 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 2,647.5 2,612.1 NET EARNINGS PER SHARE (3) Basic $ 1.41 $ 1.26 Diluted $ 1.36 $ 1.22 (1) Despite being included currently in Diluted net earnings per common share, the actual conversion to common stock occurs when the preferred shares are sold. Shares may only be sold after being allocated to the ESOP participants pursuant to the repayment of the ESOP's obligations through 2035. (2) Weighted average outstanding stock options of approximately 1 million and 69 million for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 were not included in the Diluted net earnings per share calculation because the options were out of the money or to do so would have been antidilutive (i.e., the total proceeds upon exercise would have exceeded the market value of the underlying common shares). (3) Net earnings per share are calculated on Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble. 6. Share-Based Compensation and Postretirement Benefits The following table provides a summary of our share-based compensation expense and postretirement benefit costs: Three Months Ended September 30 2019 2018 Share-based compensation expense $ 110 $ 102 Net periodic benefit cost for pension benefits (1) 40 28 Net periodic benefit cost/(credit) for other retiree benefits (1) ( 52 ) ( 41 ) (1) The components of the total net periodic benefit cost for both pension benefits and other retiree benefits for these interim periods, on an annualized basis, do not differ materially from the amounts disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019 . Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. 7. Risk Management Activities and Fair Value Measurements As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. There have been no significant changes in our risk management policies or activities during the three months ended September 30, 2019 . The Company has not changed its valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period. The Company recognizes transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of each quarter. There were no transfers between levels during the periods presented. Also, there was no significant activity within the Level 3 assets and liabilities during the periods presented. There were no significant assets or liabilities that were remeasured at fair value on a non-recurring basis for the three months ended September 30, 2019 . Other investments had a fair value of $ 62 and $ 169 as of September 30, 2019 and June 30, 2019 , respectively, and are presented in Other noncurrent assets. During the three months ended September 30, 2019 , the Company sold all of its existing U.S. government securities and corporate bond securities. Such securities were presented in Available-for-sale investment securities at June 30, 2019 , and had fair values of $ 3,648 and $ 2,400 , respectively. The Company's investments measured at fair value are generally classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Cash equivalents were $ 7,955 and $ 2,956 as of September 30, 2019 and June 30, 2019 , respectively, and are classified as Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. There are no other material investment balances classified as Level 1 or Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy, or using net asset value as a practical expedient. Fair values are generally estimated based upon quoted market prices for similar instruments. The fair value of long-term debt was $ 25,196 and $ 25,378 as of September 30, 2019 and June 30, 2019 , respectively. This includes the current portion of debt instruments ( $ 3,291 and $ 3,390 as of September 30, 2019 and June 30, 2019 , respectively). Certain long-term debt (debt designated as a fair value hedge) is recorded at fair value. All other long-term debt is recorded at amortized cost, but is measured at fair value for disclosure purposes. We consider our debt to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Fair values are generally estimated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments. Disclosures about Financial Instruments The notional amounts and fair values of financial instruments used in hedging transactions as of September 30, 2019 and June 30, 2019 are as follows: Notional Amount Fair Value Asset Fair Value (Liability) September 30, 2019 June 30, 2019 September 30, 2019 June 30, 2019 September 30, 2019 June 30, 2019 DERIVATIVES IN FAIR VALUE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Interest rate contracts $ 7,524 $ 7,721 $ 266 $ 177 $ — $ ( 1 ) DERIVATIVES IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Foreign currency interest rate contracts $ 3,309 $ 3,157 $ 104 $ 35 $ ( 16 ) $ ( 24 ) TOTAL DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS $ 10,833 $ 10,878 $ 370 $ 212 $ ( 16 ) $ ( 25 ) DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS Foreign currency contracts $ 6,196 $ 6,431 $ 19 $ 27 $ ( 49 ) $ ( 20 ) TOTAL DERIVATIVES AT FAIR VALUE $ 17,029 $ 17,309 $ 389 $ 239 $ ( 65 ) $ ( 45 ) All derivative assets are presented in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Other noncurrent assets. All derivative liabilities are presented in Accrued and other liabilities or Other noncurrent liabilities. The fair value of the interest rate derivative asset/liability directly offsets the cumulative amount of the fair value hedging adjustment included in the carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation. The carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation, which includes the unamortized discount or premium and the fair value adjustment, was $ 7,756 and $ 7,860 as of September 30, 2019 and June 30, 2019 , respectively. In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges. The carrying value of those debt instruments designated as net investment hedges, which includes the adjustment for the foreign currency transaction gain or loss on those instruments, was $ 16,995 and $ 17,154 as of September 30, 2019 and June 30, 2019 , respectively. Changes in the fair value of net investment hedges are recognized in the Foreign Currency Translation component of Other comprehensive income (OCI). All of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. Before tax gains/(losses) on our financial instruments in hedging relationships are categorized as follows: Amount of Gain/(Loss) Recognized in OCI on Derivatives Three Months Ended September 30 2019 2018 DERIVATIVES IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS (1) (2) Foreign exchange contracts $ 113 $ ( 43 ) (1) For the derivatives in net investment hedging relationships, the amount of gain/(loss) excluded from effectiveness testing, which was recognized in earnings, was $ 19 and $ 14 for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. (2) In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges. The amount of gain/(loss) recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (AOCI) for such instruments was $ 609 and $ 207 , for the three months ended September 30, 2019 and 2018 , respectively. Amount of Gain/(Loss) Recognized in Earnings Three Months Ended September 30 2019 2018 DERIVATIVES IN FAIR VALUE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Interest rate contracts $ 90 $ ( 24 ) DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS Foreign currency contracts $ ( 97 ) $ ( 2 ) The gain/(loss) on the derivatives in fair value hedging relationships is fully offset by the mark-to-market impact of the related exposure. These are both recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in Interest expense. The gain/(loss) on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is substantially offset by the currency mark-to-market of the related exposure. These are both recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in Selling, general and administrative expense (SG&A). 8. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss) The table below presents the changes in AOCI, including the reclassifications out of AOCI by component: Investment Securities Pension and Other Retiree Benefits Foreign Currency Translation Total AOCI Balance at June 30, 2019 $ 11 $ ( 4,198 ) $ ( 10,749 ) $ ( 14,936 ) OCI before reclassifications (1) ( 3 ) 104 ( 540 ) ( 439 ) Amounts reclassified from AOCI into the Consolidated Statements of Earnings (2) ( 2 ) 75 — 73 Net current period OCI ( 5 ) 179 ( 540 ) ( 366 ) Less: Other comprehensive income/(loss) attributable to non-controlling interests — — ( 4 ) ( 4 ) Balance at September 30, 2019 $ 6 $ ( 4,019 ) $ ( 11,285 ) $ ( 15,298 ) (1) Net of tax expense/(benefit) of $ 0 , $ 51 and $ 170 for gains/losses on investment securities, pension and other retiree benefit items and foreign currency translation, respectively. (2) Net of tax expense/(benefit) of $ 0 , $ 20 and $ 0 for gains/losses on investment securities, pension and other retiree benefit items and foreign currency translation, respectively. The below provides additional details on amounts reclassified from AOCI into the Consolidated Statements of Earnings: • Investment securities: amounts reclassified from AOCI into Other non-operating income, net. • Pension and other retiree benefits: amounts reclassified from AOCI into Other non-operating income, net and included in the computation of net periodic postretirement costs. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. 9. Restructuring Program The Company has historically incurred an ongoing annual level of restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Before-tax costs incurred under the ongoing program have generally ranged from $ 250 to $ 500 annually. In fiscal 2017 the Company announced specific elements of a multi-year productivity and cost savings plan to further reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, certain marketing activities and overhead expenses. This program is expected to result in incremental enrollment reductions, along with further optimization of the supply chain and other manufacturing processes. Restructuring costs incurred consist primarily of costs to separate employees, asset-related costs to exit facilities and other costs. For the three month period ended September 30, 2019 , the Company incurred total restructuring charges of $ 93 . Approximately $ 70 of these charges were recorded in Cost of products sold and approximately $ 22 of these charges were recorded in SG&A. The remainder of these charges were recorded in Other non-operating income, net. The following table presents restructuring activity for the three months ended September 30, 2019 : Reserve Balance Three Months Ended September 30, 2019 Reserve Balance June 30, 2019 Charges Cash Spent Charges Against Assets September 30, 2019 Separations $ 280 $ 34 $ ( 60 ) $ — $ 254 Asset-related costs — 45 — ( 45 ) — Other costs 188 14 ( 25 ) — 177 Total $ 468 $ 93 $ ( 85 ) $ ( 45 ) $ 431 Separation Costs Employee separation charges for the three month period ended September 30, 2019 relate to severance packages for approximately 180 employees. The packages were primarily voluntary and the amounts were calculated based on salary levels and past service periods. Severance costs related to voluntary separations are generally charged to earnings when the employee accepts the offer. Asset-Related Costs Asset-related costs consist of both asset write-downs and accelerated depreciation. Asset write-downs relate to the establishment of a new fair value basis for assets held-for-sale or disposal. These assets were written down to the lower of their current carrying basis or amounts expected to be realized upon disposal, less minor disposal costs. Charges for accelerated depreciation relate to long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period. These assets relate primarily to manufacturing consolidations and technology standardizations. The asset-related charges will not have a significant impact on future depreciation charges. Other Costs Other restructuring-type charges are incurred as a direct result of the restructuring program. Such charges primarily include asset removal and termination of contracts related to supply chain optimization. Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the restructuring program charges are funded by and included within Corporate for both management and segment reporting. Accordingly, all of the charges under the program are included within the Corporate reportable segment. However, for informative purposes, the following table summarizes the total restructuring costs related to our reportable segments: Three Months Ended September 30, 2019 Beauty $ 8 Grooming 18 Health Care 12 Fabric & Home Care 4 Baby, Feminine & Family Care 20 Corporate (1) 31 Total Company $ 93 (1) Corporate includes costs related to allocated overheads, including charges related to our Market Operations, Global Business Services and Corporate Functions activities. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. 10. Leases The Company determines whether a contract contains a lease at the inception of a contract by determining if the contract conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. We lease certain real estate, machinery, equipment, vehicles and office equipment for varying periods. Many of these leases include an option to either renew or terminate the lease. For purposes of calculating lease liabilities, these options are included within the lease term when it has become reasonably certain that the Company will exercise such options. The incremental borrowing rate utilized to calculate our lease liabilities is based on the information available at commencement date, as most of the leases do not provide an implicit borrowing rate. The Company does not have any material financing lease or sublease activities. The Company incurred lease expense for operating leases of $ 85 for the three months ended September 30, 2019 . Total cash paid related to leases during the three months ended September 30, 2019 was $ 71 , including amounts expensed and amounts capitalized. Commitments related to finance leases are not material. Short-term leases, defined as leases with initial terms of 12 months or less, are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Lease expense for such short-term leases is not material. The most significant assets in our leasing portfolio relate to real estate and vehicles. For purposes of calculating lease liabilities for such leases, we have combined lease and non-lease components. The right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new lease liabilities was $ 9 for the three months ended September 30, 2019 . Supplemental balance sheet and other information related to leases is as follows: September 30, 2019 Operating leases: Other noncurrent assets $ 887 Accrued and other liabilities 263 Other noncurrent liabilities 630 Total operating lease liabilities $ 893 Weighted average remaining lease term: Operating leases 7 years Weighted average discount rate: Operating leases 4.3 % At September 30, 2019 , future payments of operating lease liabilities were as follows: Operating Leases September 30, 2019 1 year $ 263 2 years 177 3 years 158 4 years 134 5 years 114 Over 5 years 218 Total lease payments 1,064 Less: Interest ( 171 ) Present value of lease liabilities $ 893 Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. As of June 30, 2019 , minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases by fiscal year were expected to be: Operating Leases June 30, 2019 2020 $ 263 2021 209 2022 165 2023 141 2024 121 After 2024 244 Total lease payments $ 1,143 11. Commitments and Contingencies Litigation We are subject, from time to time, to certain legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters, including antitrust and trade regulation, product liability, advertising, contracts, environmental, patent and trademark matters, labor and employment matters and tax. While considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management and our counsel, the ultimate resolution of the various lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior manufacturing and waste disposal practices. Based on currently available information, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of environmental remediation will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Income Tax Uncertainties The Company is present in approximately 70 countries and over 150 taxable jurisdictions and, at any point in time, has 40 – 50 jurisdictional audits underway at various stages of completion. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite our belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitations. Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate. We have tax years open ranging from 2008 and forward. We are generally not able to reliably estimate the ultimate settlement amounts until the close of the audit. Based on information currently available, we anticipate that over the next 12 month period, audit activity could be completed related to uncertain tax positions in multiple jurisdictions for which we have accrued existing liabilities of approximately $ 140 , including interest and penalties. Additional information on the Commitments and Contingencies of the Company can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2019 . Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. 12. Merck Acquisition On November 30, 2018, we completed our acquisition of the over the counter (OTC) healthcare business of Merck KGaA (Merck OTC) for $ 3.7 billion (based on exchange rates at the time of closing) in an all-cash transaction. This business primarily sells OTC consumer healthcare products, mainly in Europe, Latin America and Asia markets. The results of Merck OTC, which are not material to the Company, are reported in our consolidated financial statements beginning December 1, 2018. The following table presents the preliminary allocation of purchase price related to the Merck OTC business as of the date of acquisition. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price is based on the best estimates of management and is subject to revision based on final determination of fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired, which will be finalized during the quarter ended December 31, 2019, as we complete our analysis of the underlying assets and acquired liabilities, such as pensions, litigation cases, environmental issues and tax positions. Amounts in millions November 30, 2018 Current assets $ 420 Property, plant and equipment 121 Intangible assets 2,134 Goodwill 2,085 Other non-current assets 209 Total assets acquired $ 4,969 Current liabilities $ 233 Deferred income taxes 764 Non-current liabilities 95 Total liabilities acquired $ 1,092 Noncontrolling interest (1) $ 169 Net assets acquired $ 3,708 (1) Represents a 48 % minority ownership interest in the Merck India company. The acquisition resulted in $ 2.1 billion in goodwill, of which approximately $ 180 million is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. All of this goodwill was allocated to the Health Care Segment. We have preliminarily estimated the fair value of Merck OTC’s identifiable intangible assets as $ 2.1 billion . The preliminary allocation of identifiable intangible assets and their average useful lives is as follows: Amounts in millions Estimated Fair Value Avg Remaining Useful Life Intangible assets with determinable lives Brands $ 701 14 Patents and technology 162 10 Customer relationships 325 20 Total $ 1,188 15 Intangible assets with indefinite lives Brands 946 Total intangible assets $ 2,134 Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. The majority of the intangible valuation relates to brand intangibles. Our preliminary assessment as to brand intangibles that have an indefinite life and those that have a definite life was based on a number of factors, including competitive environment, market share, brand history, product life cycles, operating plan and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. The indefinite-lived brand intangibles include Neurobion and Dolo Neurobion. The definite-lived brand intangibles primarily include regional or local brands. The definite-lived brand intangibles have estimated lives ranging from 10 to 20 years. The technology intangibles are related to R&D and manufacturing know-how; these intangibles have a 10 year estimated life. The customer relationships intangibles have a 20 year estimated life and reflect the historical and projected attrition rates for Merck OTC’s relationships with health care professionals, retailers and distributors.

A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected herein, is included in the section titled “Economic Conditions and Uncertainties” and the section titled “Risk Factors” (Part II, Item 1A) of this Form 10-Q. The purpose of Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is to provide an understanding of Procter & Gamble's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. The MD&A is organized in the following sections: • Overview • Summary of Results – Three Months Ended September 30, 2019 • Economic Conditions and Uncertainties • Results of Operations – Three Months Ended September 30, 2019 • Business Segment Discussion – Three Months Ended September 30, 2019 • Liquidity and Capital Resources • Reconciliation of Measures Not Defined by U.S. GAAP Throughout the MD&A, we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales and net earnings. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), including organic sales growth, core net earnings per share (Core EPS), adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity. The explanation at the end of the MD&A provides the definition of these non-GAAP measures as well as details on the use and the derivation of these measures. Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and market consumption in the MD&A are based on a combination of vendor purchased traditional brick-and-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales in dollar terms on a constant currency basis of our products, relative to all product sales in the category. The Company measures fiscal-year-to-date market shares through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months. OVERVIEW P&G is a global leader in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories, primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, high-frequency stores and pharmacies. We also sell direct to consumers. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries. Our market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position. The table below provides detail on our reportable segments, including the product categories and brand composition within each segment. Reportable Segments Product Categories (Sub-Categories) Major Brands Beauty Hair Care ( Conditioner, Shampoo, Styling Aids, Treatments ) Head & Shoulders, Herbal Essences, Pantene, Rejoice Skin and Personal Care ( Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Personal Cleansing, Skin Care ) Olay, Old Spice, Safeguard, SK-II, Secret Grooming Grooming (1) (Shave Care - Female Blades & Razors, Male Blades & Razors, Pre- and Post-Shave Products, Other Shave Care; Appliances) Braun, Gillette, Venus Health Care Oral Care ( Toothbrushes, Toothpaste, Other Oral Care ) Crest, Oral-B Personal Health Care ( Gastrointestinal, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements, Pain Relief, Other Personal Health Care ) Metamucil, Neurobion, Pepto Bismol, Vicks Fabric & Home Care Fabric Care ( Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Additives, Laundry Detergents ) Ariel, Downy, Gain, Tide Home Care ( Air Care, Dish Care, P&G Professional, Surface Care ) Cascade, Dawn, Fairy, Febreze, Mr. Clean, Swiffer Baby, Feminine & Family Care Baby Care ( Baby Wipes, Taped Diapers and Pants ) Luvs, Pampers Feminine Care ( Adult Incontinence, Feminine Care ) Always, Always Discreet, Tampax Family Care ( Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper ) Bounty, Charmin, Puffs (1) The Grooming product category is comprised of the Shave Care and Appliances operating segments. The following table provides the percentage of net sales and net earnings by reportable business segment for the three months ended September 30, 2019 (excluding net sales and net earnings in Corporate): Three Months Ended September 30, 2019 Net Sales Net Earnings Beauty 20% 25% Grooming 9% 10% Health Care 12% 11% Fabric & Home Care 33% 29% Baby, Feminine & Family Care 26% 25% Total Company 100% 100% SUMMARY OF RESULTS Following are highlights of results for the three months ended September 30, 2019 versus the three months ended September 30, 2018 : • Net sales increased 7% to $17.8 billion , driven by a 20% increase in Health Care, a high single digits increase in Beauty and mid-single digits increases in Fabric & Home Care and Baby, Feminine & Family Care, partially offset by a low single digit decline in Grooming. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, increased 7% , driven by a double digits increase in Beauty, high single digits increases in Health Care and Fabric & Home Care, a mid-single digit increase in Baby, Feminine & Family Care and a low single digit increase in Grooming. • Unit volume increased 5% , with organic volume up 4% . Volume increased high teens in Health Care, mid-single digits in Fabric & Home Care, and low single digits in Beauty and in Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Volume decreased low single digits in Grooming. Excluding the impacts of the Merck OTC acquisition, organic volume increased mid-single digits in Health Care. • Net earnings were $3.6 billion , an increase of $0.4 billion or 13% versus the prior year due to the increase in net sales, an increase in operating margin and a reduction in the current year income tax rate, partially offset by the base period gain on dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership. • Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $0.4 billion or 12% versus the prior year to $3.6 billion . • Diluted net earnings per share increased 11% to $1.36 due primarily to the increase in net earnings. • Core net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble, which represents net earnings excluding incremental restructuring charges in both periods and the base period gain on the dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership, increased 24% to $3.6 billion. Core net earnings per share increased 22% to $1.37 due primarily to the increase in Core net earnings. • Operating cash flow was $4.2 billion . Adjusted free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less capital expenditures and certain other impacts, was $3.3 billion . Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 91% . ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES Global Economic Conditions . Our products are sold in numerous countries across North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa with more than half our sales generated outside the United States. As such, we are exposed to and impacted by global macroeconomic factors, U.S. and foreign government policies and foreign exchange fluctuations. Current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic, and any causes of market size contraction, such as reduced GDP in commodity-dependent economies, greater political unrest in the Middle East, Central & Eastern Europe, Greater China and the Korean peninsula, economic uncertainty related to the execution of the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, political instability in certain Latin American markets and overall economic slowdowns, could reduce our sales or erode our operating margin, in either case reducing our earnings. Changes in Costs . Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, transportation costs and our own productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities, in particular, certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp, and volatility in the market price of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs. If we are unable to manage commodity fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions, as well as through consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our gross margin, operating margin and net earnings. Sales could also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on consumption of our products. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including outsourcing projects, supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. As discussed later in this MD&A, in 2012 we initiated overhead and supply chain cost improvement projects. In fiscal 2017, we communicated specific elements of an additional multi-year cost reduction program which is resulting in enrollment reductions and other savings. If we are not successful in executing and sustaining these changes, there could be a negative impact on our operating margin and net earnings. Foreign Exchange . We have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates. Translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation of transaction-related working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. In four of the past five fiscal years, as well as the current year, the U.S. dollar has strengthened versus a number of foreign currencies leading to lower sales and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts. Certain countries experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations, like Argentina, Brazil, China and the United Kingdom have previously had, and could in the future have, a significant impact on our sales, costs and earnings. Increased pricing in response to certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could also have a negative impact on consumption of our products, which would affect our sales and profits. Government Policies . Our net earnings could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government tax policies, for example, the U.S. Tax Act enacted in December 2017, and the current work being led by the OECD for the G20 focused on ""Addressing the Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy."" The breadth of this project extends beyond pure digital businesses and is likely to impact all multinational businesses by redefining jursidictional taxing rights. Additionally, we attempt to carefully manage our debt, currency and other exposures in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and pricing controls, such as Nigeria, Algeria, Egypt, Argentina and Turkey. Further, our earnings and sales could be affected by changes to international trade agreements in North America and elsewhere, including increases of import tariffs, both currently effective and future potential changes. Changes in government policies in these areas might cause an increase or decrease in our sales, operating margin and net earnings. For information on risk factors that could impact our results, please refer to “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2019. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Three Months Ended September 30, 2019 The following discussion provides a review of results for the three months ended September 30, 2019 versus the three months ended September 30, 2018 .

Unit volume increased 5% . Excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures, organic volume increased 4%. Increased pricing had a 1% favorable impact to net sales. Mix was a 2% positive impact to net sales, driven by disproportionate organic growth of Japan, Skin & Personal Care and Personal Health Care categories, all of which have higher than company average selling prices. Volume increased high teens in Health Care, increased mid-single digits in Fabric & Home Care and increased low single digits in Beauty and in Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Volume decreased low-single digits in Grooming. Excluding the impacts of the Merck OTC acquisition, Health Care organic volume increased mid-single digits. On a regional basis, volume growth was driven by high single digits increases in Latin America and in Asia Pacific, primarily due to inventory build by retailers in Japan in advance of a VAT increase effective October 2019, and mid-single digits increases in North America, Europe, Greater China, and India, Middle East and Africa (IMEA). Excluding the impact of minor acquisitions and divestitures, organic volume increased mid-single digits in Latin America and increased low single digits in Greater China, Europe and IMEA. Organic sales increased 7% on a 4% increase in organic volume.

(2) Net sales percentage changes are approximations based on quantitative formulas that are consistently appl ied. Operating Costs Gross margin increased 180 basis points to 51.0% of net sales for the quarter. Gross margin benefited from: • 90 basis points of gross manufacturing cost savings projects (80 basis points net of product and packaging reinvestments), • 70 basis points of positive pricing impacts, • 40 basis points of lower commodity costs, and • 50 basis points of other benefits These benefits were partially offset by a 10 basis point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange and a 50 basis point net decline from unfavorable product mix (primarily mix within segments due to the growth of lower margin product forms and large sizes in certain categories and due to the disproportionate growth of the Fabric Care category which is one of our largest categories and has lower than company-average margins). Total SG&A spending increased 3% to $4.8 billion due to increases in marketing spending and overhead costs, partially offset by a reduction in other operating costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 100 basis points to 26.9% due to a decrease in overhead, marketing spending and other operating costs as a percentage of net sales. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 20 basis points due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and savings in agency compensation, production costs and advertising spending, partially offset by reinvestments in media and other marketing spending. Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales decreased 30 basis points driven by the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase, productivity savings and lower restructuring charges versus the base period, partially offset by inflation, higher incentive compensation costs and other cost increases. Other net operating costs as a percentage of net sales decreased 50 basis points due to a reduction in foreign exchange transaction charges and gains from legal settlements. Productivity-driven cost savings delivered 70 basis points of benefit in SG&A. Non-Operating Expenses and Income Interest expense was $108 million for the quarter, a decrease of $21 million versus the prior year period due to a decrease in average debt balances. Interest income was $58 million for the quarter, a $5 million increase versus the prior year period due to an increase in higher yield investment securities balances. Other non-operating income was $103 million , a decrease of $359 million due to the base period gain from the dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership. Income Taxes For the three months ended September 30, 2019 the effective tax rate decreased 180 basis points versus the prior year period to 16.7% due to: • a 150 basis-point reduction from increased excess tax benefits of share-based compensation (200 basis points in the current year versus 50 basis points in the prior year), • a 120 basis-point reduction from a non-recurring tax benefit arising from a simplification of our legal entity structure, • a 90 basis-point reduction from favorable impacts from geographic mix of earnings, • partially offset by a 180 basis-point increase related to the prior year tax impact of the gain on the dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership. Net Earnings Operating income increased $736 million, or 21% to $4.3 billion due to the net sales increase, the increase in gross margins and the reduction in SG&A as a percentage of sales, all of which are described above. Net earnings increased $406 million or 13% to $3.6 billion due to the increase in operating income and the lower tax rates as described above, partially offset by the base period gain on the PGT Healthcare partnership dissolution. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of $50 million on net earnings for the quarter, including both transactional charges and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars. Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $394 million or 12% to $3.6 billion for the quarter. Diluted net earnings per share increased 11% to $1.36 . Core net earnings per share increased 22% to $1.37 . Core net earnings per share represents diluted net earnings per share excluding the incremental restructuring charges in both periods related to our productivity and cost savings plans and the gain on dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership in the base period. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSION – Three Months Ended September 30, 2019 The following discussion provides a review of results by reportable business segment. Analysis of the results for the three months period ended September 30, 2019 is provided based on a comparison to the same three months period ended September 30, 2018 . The primary financial measures used to evaluate segment performance are net sales and net earnings. The table below provides supplemental information on net sales and net earnings by reportable business segment for the three months ended September 30, 2019 versus the comparable prior year period (dollar amounts in millions): Three Months Ended September 30, 2019 Net Sales % Change Versus Year Ago Earnings/(Loss) Before Income Taxes % Change Versus Year Ago Net Earnings % Change Versus Year Ago Beauty $ 3,552 8 % $ 1,092 15 % $ 874 15 % Grooming 1,531 (2 )% 426 2 % 353 4 % Health Care 2,221 20 % 540 23 % 401 21 % Fabric & Home Care 5,832 6 % 1,338 17 % 1,028 17 % Baby, Feminine & Family Care 4,567 4 % 1,134 26 % 871 26 % Corporate 95 N/A (187 ) N/A 90 N/A Total Company $ 17,798 7 % $ 4,343 10 % $ 3,617 13 % Beauty Three months ended September 30, 2019 compared with three months ended September 30, 2018 Beauty net sales increased 8% to $3.6 billion during the first fiscal quarter on a 3% increase in unit volume . Favorable product mix added 4% to net sales due to the disproportionate growth of the Skin and Personal Care category, including the super-premium SK-II brand, which has higher than segment average selling prices. Higher pricing increased net sales by 3%. Unfavorable foreign exchange impacts reduced net sales by 2%. Organic sales increased 10% . Global market share of the Beauty segment increased 0.3 points . Volume growth was driven by a mid-single digit increase in North America, Asia Pacific, Latin America and IMEA and a low single digits increase in Europe. The volume increase in Asia Pacific was primarily driven by an increase in retailer inventories in Japan prior to a VAT increase in October 2019. • Volume in Hair Care increased low single digits . Increased volume was driven by mid-single digits growth in North America, Asia Pacific, Europe, Latin America and IMEA (due to product innovation, market growth and Japan retailer inventory increase), partially offset by a low single digits decline in Greater China due to competitive activities. Excluding the impact of minor brand acquisitions, volume increased low single digits in North America. Global market share of the Hair Care category was unchanged . • Volume in Skin and Personal Care increased mid-single digits . Volume increased in all regions, led by a high single digits increase in Greater China and mid-single digits increases in North America and Latin America driven by premium innovation. Global market share of the Skin and Personal Care category increased more than half a point . Net earnings increased 15% to $874 million due to the increase in net sales and a 150 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. The net earnings margin increased primarily due to a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of sales, along with an increase in gross margin. The gross margin increase was primarily driven by increased pricing, partially offset by negative foreign exchange impacts and other hurts related to new manufacturing startup costs. The reduction in SG&A as a percentage of sales was primarily due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase. Grooming Three months ended September 30, 2019 compared with three months ended September 30, 2018 Grooming net sales decreased 2% to $1.5 billion during the first fiscal quarter on a 1% decrease in unit volume . Unfavorable foreign exchange had a negative 2% impact on net sales. Pricing had a positive 1% impact on net sales. Organic sales increased 1% . Global market share of the Grooming segment decreased 0.4 points . The volume decrease was driven by a high single digits decline in North America, partially offset by a mid-single digits increase in Greater China and a low single digits increase in Latin America. • Shave Care volume decreased low single digits . The volume decrease was driven by a high single digits decline in North America due to competitive activity, partially offset by a mid-single digits increase in Greater China and low single digit increases in Latin America and Asia Pacific due to product innovation. Global market share of the Shave Care category was unchanged . • Volume in Appliances decreased mid-single digits. A decline of more than 20% in Asia Pacific (due to market contraction, competitive activities and a reduction in trade inventories), was partially offset by mid-single digit volume increase in Greater China due to innovation. Global market share of the Appliances category was unchanged . Net earnings increased 4% to $353 million due to a 130 basis-point increase in net earnings margin, partially offset by the reduction in net sales. Net earnings margin increased primarily due to a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales and a reduction in effective tax rates, partially offset by a reduction in gross margin. Gross margin declined due to the negative impact of unfavorable mix (due to the growth of lower margin products), partially offset by the positive impacts of manufacturing cost savings and increased pricing. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to a favorable legal settlement in the current period and reduction in overhead costs due to productivity savings, partially offset by the negative scale impacts of the net sales decrease. Health Care Three months ended September 30, 2019 compared with three months ended September 30, 2018 Health Care net sales increased 20% to $2.2 billion during the first fiscal quarter on a 17% increase in unit volume . Excluding the impact of the Merck OTC consumer healthcare acquisition, organic sales increased 9% and organic volume increased 6%. Unfavorable foreign exchange impacts decreased net sales by 2%. Higher pricing increased net sales by 1%. Favorable mix increased net sales by 2% due to the disproportionate organic growth of premium products and the North America region which have higher than segment average margins. Global market share of the Health Care segment increased 0.3 points . Volume increased in all regions, led by over 20% growth in Europe, Latin America, IMEA and Asia Pacific and high single digits growth in North America. Excluding the impact of the Merck OTC consumer healthcare acquisition, organic volume increased high single digits in IMEA and in Latin America and increased low single digits in Europe and in Asia Pacific. • Oral Care volume increased mid-single digits . Increased volume was driven by high teens growth in IMEA and high single digits growth in North America, Asia Pacific and Latin America due to innovation and market growth. Global market share of the Oral Care category increased nearly half a point . • Volume in Personal Health Care increased more than 50% versus the prior year period. Excluding the impact of the Merck OTC consumer healthcare acquisition, organic volume increased high single digits. The organic volume increase was driven by over 20% growth in Europe and double digits growth in North America (due to innovation and higher retailer inventory build for the cough/cold season versus the year ago period), partially offset by double digit volume declines in Asia Pacific due to devaluation-related price increases. Global market share of the Personal Health Care category increased slightly . Net earnings increased 21% to $401 million , primarily due to the increase in net sales. Net earnings margin increased 10 basis points as an increase in gross margin was largely offset by an increase in SG&A as a percentage of sales and an increase in income tax rates. The increase in gross margin was driven by the positive impacts of increased pricing and favorable mix due to the disproportionate growth of the North America region which has higher than segment-average margins, partially offset by the mix impact of the Merck OTC consumer healthcare acquisition. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to an increase in overheads and other operating expenses caused by the impact of the Merck OTC consumer healthcare acquisition, partially offset by the positive scale benefits of the net sales increase. Fabric & Home Care Three months ended September 30, 2019 compared with three months ended September 30, 2018 Fabric & Home Care net sales increased 6% to $5.8 billion during the first fiscal quarter on a 6% increase in unit volume . Unfavorable foreign exchange impacts reduced net sales by 1%. Positive mix impacts increased net sales by 1% due to the disproportionate growth of premium products. Organic sales increased 8% . Global market share of the Fabric & Home Care segment increased 0.7 points . Volume growth was driven by double digit increases in Asia Pacific, Greater China and Latin America and mid-single digit increases in North America and Europe. The volume increase in Asia Pacific was partially driven by an increase in retailer inventories in Japan prior to a VAT increase in October 2019. • Fabric Care volume increased high single digits . Volume increased in all regions led by double digits growth in Asia Pacific, Greater China and Latin America, high single digits growth in North America and mid-single digits growth in Europe. Growth was driven by product innovation, market growth and the increase in Japan retailer inventories prior to a VAT increase. Global market share of the Fabric Care category increased half a point . • Home Care volume increased low single digits . Excluding the impact of minor brand divestitures, organic volume increased mid-single digits. Increased volume was driven by high single digits growth in Asia Pacific, mid-single digits growth in Europe and low single digits growth in North America. Volume grew behind product innovation and the increase in Japan retailer inventories prior to a VAT increase. Global market share of the Home Care category increased more than a point . Net earnings increased 17% to $1.0 billion due to the increase in net sales and a 160 basis point increase in net earnings margin. The net earnings margin increase was primarily due to an increase in gross margin, along with a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of sales. The gross margin increase was driven by manufacturing cost savings and reduction in commodity costs. SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales was down due to the positive scale benefits of the net sales increase. Baby, Feminine & Family Care Three months ended September 30, 2019 compared with three months ended September 30, 2018 Baby, Feminine & Family Care net sales increased 4% to $4.6 billion during the first fiscal quarter on a 2% increase in unit volume . Unfavorable foreign exchange impacts decreased net sales by 1%. Higher pricing increased net sales by 2%. Positive mix increased net sales by 1% due to the disproportionate growth of premium products, which have higher than segment average margins. Organic sales increased 5% . Global market share of the Baby, Feminine & Family Care segment decreased 0.5 points . Volume growth was driven by a mid-teens increase in Asia Pacific and a mid-single digit increase in North America, partially offset by a low single digit decline in Europe and Latin America. Excluding the impact of minor brand acquisitions, organic volume increased low single digits in North America. The volume increase in Asia Pacific was primarily driven by an increase in retailer inventories in Japan prior to a VAT increase in October 2019. • Volume in Baby Care decreased low single digits . Volume decreased high single digits in Latin America and mid-single digits in Europe due to competitive activity, devaluation related price increases and category contraction in certain markets. This was partially offset by high teens volume increase in Asia Pacific due to the increase in Japan retailer inventories prior to the VAT increase, mid-single digit increase in Greater China, and low single digit increase in North America due to product innovation. Global market share of the Baby Care category decreased more than a point . • Volume in Feminine Care increased mid-single digits . Volume increased high single digits in IMEA and Latin America and increased mid-single digits in Europe due to product innovation and adult incontinence category growth. Global market share of the Feminine Care category was unchanged . • Volume in Family Care, which is predominantly a North American business, increased mid-single digits driven by product innovation, partially offset by volume declines due to price increases. North America share of the Family Care category decreased nearly half a point . Net earnings increased 26% to $871 million due to the increase in net sales and a 330 basis point increase in net earnings margin. Net earnings margin increased primarily due to an increase in gross margin,along with a reduction in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin increased due to manufacturing cost savings projects, increased pricing and a reduction in commodity costs, partially offset by negative foreign exchange impacts. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased due to reduced overhead costs, driven by productivity savings, partially offset by an increase in marketing spending as a percentage of net sales. Corporate Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business segments. These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level; financing and investing activities; certain employee benefit costs; other general corporate items; the gains and losses related to certain divested brands and categories; certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the segments to U.S. GAAP. The most significant reconciling item includes income taxes to adjust from blended statutory rates that are reflected in the segments to the overall Company effective tax rate. Corporate net sales decreased $21 million to $ 95 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2019 . Corporate net earnings decreased $121 million in the quarter primarily due to the base period gain on the dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership, partially offset by lower restructuring charges versus the base period, lower foreign exchange transactional charges, lower interest expense and a decrease in effective tax rates, all of which have been described above. Restructuring Program to deliver Productivity and Cost Savings In 2012, the Company initiated a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs and better leverage scale in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overheads. The plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes to fund the Company's growth strategy. In 2017, the Company communicated specific elements of an additional multi-year productivity and cost savings program. The current productivity and cost savings plan will further reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, certain marketing activities and overhead expenses. As part of this plan, the Company incurred $1.8 billion in total before-tax restructuring costs across fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019, with an additional amount of approximately $0.6 billion expected in fiscal 2020. This program is expected to result in additional enrollment reductions, along with further optimization of the supply chain and other manufacturing processes. Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the resulting charges are funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting. In addition to our restructuring programs, we have additional ongoing savings efforts in our supply chain, marketing and overhead areas that yield additional benefits to our operating margins. Refer to Note 9 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the restructuring program. LIQUIDITY & CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating Activities We generated $4.2 billion of cash from operating activities fiscal year to date, an increase of $602 million versus the prior year. Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, deferred income taxes and gain on sale of assets), generated $3.9 billion of operating cash flow. Working capital and other impacts generated $307 million of cash in the period. Accounts receivable increased, using $261 million of cash, primarily due to sales growth and to a lesser extent, the extension of customer payment terms for seasonal products. These increases were partially offset by the timing of the quarter-end (which fell on a Monday versus Sunday in the prior year end, resulting in greater collections). Inventory consumed $549 million of cash primarily to support business growth, holiday seasonality builds in certain categories and product initiatives. Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities increased, generating $1.2 billion of cash. An increase in taxes payable drove approximately $900 million of the increase, including an approximate $500 million increase in taxes payable related to the integration of Merck, which had no impact on operating cash flows, as there was an equal and offsetting release of a deferred tax liability created on the acquisition of Merck. The remaining balance of the increase was primarily driven by an increase in payables to support the increase in inventory and to a lesser extent extended payment terms with our suppliers, partially offset by the payment of prior fiscal year incentive compensation. All other operating assets and liabilities used $35 million of cash. Investing Activities Investing activities generated $5.1 billion of cash fiscal year to date. Capital expenditures were $1.1 billion , or 6.1% of net sales. We received $6.2 billion of cash from sales and maturities of investment securities. Financing Activities Our financing activities used $4.1 billion of net cash fiscal year to date. We used $3.0 billion for treasury stock purchases, $1.9 billion for dividends and $61 million for debt repayments. Cash from the exercise of stock options and other impacts generated $875 million of cash. As of September 30, 2019 , our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $8.3 billion . We have short- and long-term debt to meet our financing needs. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements. RECONCILIATION OF MEASURES NOT DEFINED BY U.S. GAAP In accordance with the SEC's Regulation S-K Item 10(e), the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measures. We believe that these measures provide useful perspective on underlying business results and trends (i.e., trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and provide a supplemental measure of year-on-year results. The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measure, but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted. Organic sales growth : Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. This measure is used in assessing achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. Adjusted free cash flow : Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the comprehensive U.S. legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017 (the U.S. Tax Act). Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. Management views adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments. Adjusted free cash flow productivity : Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings. Management views adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G’s ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. This measure is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. The Company's long-term target is to generate annual adjusted free cash flow productivity at or above 90 percent. Core EPS : Core earnings per share, or Core EPS, is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share adjusted as indicated. Management views this non-GAAP measure as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time. This measure is also used when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation. The Core earnings measures included in the following reconciliation tables refer to the equivalent GAAP measures adjusted as applicable for the following items: Incremental Restructuring : The Company has had and continues to have an ongoing level of restructuring activities. Such activities have resulted in ongoing annual restructuring related charges of approximately $250 - $500 million before tax. In 2012, the Company began a $10 billion strategic productivity and cost savings initiative that included incremental restructuring activities. In 2017, we communicated details of an additional multi-year productivity and cost savings plan. This results in incremental restructuring charges to accelerate productivity efforts and cost savings. The adjustment to Core earnings includes only the restructuring costs above what we believe are the normal recurring level of restructuring costs. Gain on Dissolution of PGT Healthcare Partnership: The Company finalized the dissolution of our PGT Healthcare partnership, a venture between the Company and Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries, Ltd. (Teva) in the OTC consumer healthcare business, in the quarter ended September 30, 2018. The transaction was accounted for as a sale of the Teva portion of the PGT business and resulted in the Company recognizing an after-tax gain on the dissolution of $353 million. We do not view the above items to be part of our sustainable results and their exclusion from Core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results. These items are also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation.

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Basis of Presentation These statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 and the Form 8-K filed October 22, 2018 to update the Form 10-K to revise disclosures to reflect the adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ASU 2017-07 and 2016-18. For additional details on the impacts of adoption, see Note 2. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of The Procter & Gamble Company and subsidiaries (the ""Company,"" ""Procter & Gamble,"" ""P&G,"" ""we"" or ""our"") contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods reported. However, the results of operations included in such financial statements may not necessarily be indicative of annual results. 2. New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies and U.S. Tax Reform On July 1, 2018 , we adopted ASU 2014-09, ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)."" This guidance outlines a single, comprehensive model of accounting for revenue from contracts with customers. We adopted the standard using the modified retrospective transition method, under which prior periods were not revised to reflect the impacts of the new standard. Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished product to customers. Those sales predominantly contain a single delivery element and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when ownership, risks and rewards transfer. Accordingly, the timing of revenue recognition is not materially impacted by the new standard. Trade promotions, consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances, in-store merchandising funds, advertising and other promotional activities, and consumer coupons, are offered through various programs to customers and consumers. The adoption of the new standard impacts the accrual timing for certain portions of our customer and consumer promotional spending, which resulted in a cumulative reduction to Retained earnings of $534 , net of tax, on the date of adoption. The provisions of the new standard also impact the classification of certain payments to customers, moving an immaterial amount of such payments from expense to a deduction from net sales. Had this standard been effective and adopted during fiscal 2018, the impact would have been to reclassify $232 from Selling, General and Administrative expense (SG&A) to a reduction of Net sales for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 and $309 for the year ended June 30, 2018 , with no impact to operating profit. This guidance included practical expedients, none of which are material to our Consolidated Financial Statements. This new guidance does not have any other material impacts on our Consolidated Financial Statements, including financial disclosures. On July 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2017-07, ""Compensation-Retirement Benefits: Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost (Topic 715)."" This guidance requires an entity to disaggregate the current service cost component from the other components of net benefit costs in the face of the income statement. It requires the service cost component to be presented with other current compensation costs for the related employees in the operating section of the income statement, with other components of net benefit cost presented outside of income from operations. We adopted the standard retrospectively, using the practical expedient which allows entities to use information previously disclosed in their pension and other postretirement benefit plans footnote as the basis to apply the retrospective presentation requirements. As such, prior periods’ results have been revised to report the other components of net defined benefit costs, previously reported in Cost of products sold and SG&A, in Other non-operating income, net. In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, ""Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash (Topic 230)."" This guidance requires the Statement of Cash Flows to present changes in the total of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. Prior to the adoption of this ASU, the relevant accounting guidance did not require the Statement of Cash Flows to include changes in restricted cash. We adopted the standard retrospectively on July 1, 2018. We currently have no significant restricted cash balances. Historically, we had restricted cash balances and changes related to divestiture activity. Such balances were presented as Current assets held for sale on the balance sheets, with changes presented as Investing activities on the Statements of Cash Flow. In accordance with ASU 2016-08, such balances are now included in the beginning and ending balances of Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash for all periods presented. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, ""Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Topic 220)."" This guidance permits companies to make an election to reclassify stranded tax effects from the recently enacted U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act included in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (AOCI) to Retained earnings. ASU 2018-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company elected to early adopt this guidance in the quarter ended September 30, 2018. The reclassification from the adoption of this standard resulted in an increase of $326 to Retained earnings and a decrease of $326 to AOCI. In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, ""Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity transfers of Assets other than Inventory."" The standard eliminates the prohibition in ASC 740 against the immediate recognition of the current and deferred income tax effects of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. We have adopted this standard effective July 1, 2018 on a modified Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. retrospective basis. The adoption of ASU 2016-16 did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, including the cumulative effect adjustment required upon adoption. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, ""Leases (Topic 842)."" The standard requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and requires expanded disclosures about leasing arrangements. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, “Leases (Topic 842) Targeted Improvements”. The updated guidance provides an optional transition method, which allows for the application of the standard as of the adoption date with no restatement of prior period amounts. We plan to adopt the standard on July 1, 2019 under the optional transition method described above. We are currently in the process of implementing lease accounting software as well as assessing the impact that the new standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which will consist primarily of a balance sheet gross up of our operating leases to show equal and offsetting lease assets and lease liabilities. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, ""Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment."" The standard simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by requiring a goodwill impairment to be measured using a single step impairment model, whereby the impairment equals the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the specified reporting units in their entirety. This eliminates the second step of the current impairment model that requires companies to first estimate the fair value of all assets in a reporting unit and measure impairments based on those fair values and a residual measurement approach. It also specifies that any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We will adopt the standard no later than July 1, 2020. The impact of the new standard will be dependent on the specific facts and circumstances of future individual impairments, if any. No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had, or is expected to have, a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. U.S. Tax Reform On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the ""U.S. Tax Act""). The U.S. Tax Act significantly revises the future ongoing U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the U.S. corporate income tax rates and implementing a hybrid territorial tax system. As the Company has a June 30 fiscal year-end, the lower corporate income tax rate was phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal rate of approximately 28% for our fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 , and 21% for subsequent fiscal years. However, the U.S. Tax Act eliminated the domestic manufacturing deduction and moved to a hybrid territorial system, which also largely eliminated the ability to credit certain foreign taxes that existed prior to enactment of the U.S. Tax Act. There are also certain transitional impacts of the U.S. Tax Act. As part of the transition to the new hybrid territorial tax system, the U.S. Tax Act imposed a one-time repatriation tax on deemed repatriation of historical earnings of foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate caused us to adjust our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities to the lower federal base rate of 21% . These transitional impacts resulted in a provisional net charge of $602 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 , and $650 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2018 , comprised of a repatriation tax charge of $3.9 billion (comprised of U.S. repatriation taxes and foreign withholding taxes) and a net deferred tax benefit of $3.2 billion . We finalized our assessment of the transitional impacts of the U.S. Tax Act during the quarter ended December 31, 2018 and there was no significant impact on tax expense during the nine months ended March 31, 2019 . Any legislative changes, as well as any other new or proposed Treasury regulations, which have yet to be issued, may result in additional income tax impacts which could be material in the period any such changes are enacted. 3. Segment Information Under U.S. GAAP, our Global Business Units (GBUs) are aggregated into five reportable segments: 1) Beauty, 2) Grooming, 3) Health Care, 4) Fabric & Home Care and 5) Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Our five reportable segments are comprised of: • Beauty : Hair Care (Conditioner, Shampoo, Styling Aids, Treatments); Skin and Personal Care (Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Personal Cleansing, Skin Care); • Grooming : Shave Care (Female Blades & Razors, Male Blades & Razors, Pre- and Post-Shave Products, Other Shave Care); Appliances • Health Care : Oral Care (Toothbrushes, Toothpaste, Other Oral Care); Personal Health Care (Gastrointestinal, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements, Other Personal Health Care); • Fabric & Home Care : Fabric Care (Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Additives, Laundry Detergents); Home Care (Air Care, Dish Care, P&G Professional, Surface Care); and • Baby, Feminine & Family Care : Baby Care (Baby Wipes, Diapers and Pants); Feminine Care (Adult Incontinence, Feminine Care); Family Care (Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper). Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. Our business units are comprised of similar product categories. Nine business units individually accounted for 5% or more of consolidated net sales as follows: % of Net sales by Business Unit (1) Three Months Ended March 31 Nine Months Ended March 31 2019 2018 2019 2018 Fabric Care 22% 22% 23% 22% Baby Care 12% 13% 12% 13% Home Care 11% 11% 10% 10% Skin and Personal Care 10% 9% 10% 9% Hair Care 9% 10% 9% 10% Family Care 8% 8% 9% 8% Oral Care 8% 8% 8% 8% Shave Care 8% 8% 8% 8% Feminine Care 6% 6% 6% 6% All Other 6% 5% 5% 6% Total 100% 100% 100% 100% (1) % of Net sales by business unit excludes sales held in Corporate. Following is a summary of reportable segment results: Three Months Ended March 31 Nine Months Ended March 31 Net Sales Earnings/(Loss) Before Income Taxes Net Earnings Net Sales Earnings/(Loss) Before Income Taxes Net Earnings Beauty 2019 $ 3,061 $ 675 $ 551 $ 9,707 $ 2,586 $ 2,082 2018 2,934 642 488 9,305 2,331 1,775 Grooming 2019 1,424 329 344 4,603 1,194 1,062 2018 1,550 422 334 4,903 1,367 1,086 Health Care 2019 2,115 462 358 6,180 1,571 1,210 2018 1,934 467 305 6,048 1,590 1,065 Fabric & Home Care 2019 5,382 1,114 847 16,427 3,392 2,584 2018 5,262 1,001 635 16,079 3,281 2,118 Baby, Feminine & Family Care 2019 4,357 861 653 13,305 2,693 2,052 2018 4,458 852 539 13,616 2,749 1,766 Corporate 2019 123 (163 ) 23 368 (302 ) 213 2018 143 (131 ) 239 378 (281 ) 161 Total Company 2019 $ 16,462 $ 3,278 $ 2,776 $ 50,590 $ 11,134 $ 9,203 2018 16,281 3,253 2,540 50,329 11,037 7,971 4. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill is allocated by reportable segment as follows: Beauty Grooming Health Care Fabric & Home Care Baby, Feminine & Family Care Total Company Goodwill at June 30, 2018 $ 12,992 $ 19,820 $ 5,929 $ 1,865 $ 4,569 $ 45,175 Acquisitions and divestitures 132 — 1,960 6 57 2,155 Translation and other (202 ) (212 ) (81 ) (18 ) (64 ) (577 ) Goodwill at March 31, 2019 $ 12,922 $ 19,608 $ 7,808 $ 1,853 $ 4,562 $ 46,753 Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. Goodwill from current year acquisitions primarily reflects the acquisition of the over-the-counter (OTC) healthcare business of Merck KGaA (Merck OTC) in the Health Care reportable segment (see Note 11), along with other minor acquisitions in the Beauty, Baby, Feminine & Family Care and Fabric & Home Care reportable segments. Goodwill increases due to acquisitions was partially offset by the divestiture of the Teva portion of the PGT business in the Health Care reportable segment and currency translation. Identifiable intangible assets at March 31, 2019 were comprised of: Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Intangible assets with determinable lives $ 8,586 $ (5,338 ) Intangible assets with indefinite lives 22,588 — Total identifiable intangible assets $ 31,174 $ (5,338 ) Intangible assets with determinable lives consist of brands, patents, technology and customer relationships. The intangible assets with indefinite lives consist of brands. The amortization expense of intangible assets for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 was $98 and $75 , respectively. For the nine months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 , the amortization expense of intangible assets was $252 and $227 , respectively. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are tested annually for impairment. The test to evaluate goodwill for impairment is a two-step process. In the first step, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a second step to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. The second step of the impairment analysis requires a valuation of a reporting unit's tangible and intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of purchase price in a business combination. If the resulting implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is less than its carrying value, that difference represents an impairment. The business unit valuations used to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment, margin expansion and Company business plans. We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable. However, future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. Our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets occurs during the 3 months ended December 31. Because of the relative size of the cushions in the Shave Care reporting unit and related Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset, as discussed in the following paragraph, and the business unit performance, we updated our step-one impairment test during the quarter ended March 31, 2019 . Most of our goodwill reporting units are comprised of a combination of legacy and acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that, at a minimum, exceed two times their underlying carrying values. Certain of our goodwill reporting units, in particular Shave Care and Appliances, are comprised entirely of acquired businesses and as a result, have fair value cushions that are not as high. Both of these wholly acquired reporting units have fair value cushions that currently equal or exceed the underlying carrying values. However, the overall Shave Care goodwill cushion and related Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset cushion have been reduced in recent years, with the fair values in the current year being reduced to amounts that approximate the reporting unit's carrying value and indefinite lived intangible. These reductions are due in large part to an increased competitive market environment in the U.S. and certain other markets, a deceleration of category growth caused by changing grooming habits and significant currency devaluations in a number of countries relative to the U.S. dollar, which collectively have resulted in reduced cash flow projections. The current year reduction in the fair value was primarily caused by further currency devaluations, along with competitive activities. As a result of these factors and the reduction in the fair values and related cushions, goodwill for the Shave Care reporting unit and the related indefinite-lived intangible asset are more susceptible to impairment risk. The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the net sales and earnings growth rates (including residual growth rates) and discount rate. The residual growth rate represents the expected rate at which the reporting unit and Gillette brand are expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period. The residual growth rate utilized in our fair value estimates is consistent with the reporting unit and brand operating plans, and approximates expected long term category market growth rates. The residual growth rate is dependent on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, relative currency exchange rates and business activities that impact market share. As a result, the residual growth rate could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes, devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or an increased competitive environment. The discount rate, which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, such as further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar. Spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the U.S. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. While management can and has implemented strategies to address these events, changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that would trigger future impairment charges of the reporting unit's goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. As of March 31, 2019 , the carrying values of Shave Care goodwill and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset were $19.3 billion and $15.7 billion , respectively. The table below provides a sensitivity analysis for the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite lived intangible asset, utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the shorter term and residual growth rates and the discount rate, to demonstrate the potential impacts to the estimated fair values. The table below provides, in isolation, the estimated fair value impacts related to a 25 basis point increase to discount rate or a 25 basis point decrease to our shorter-term and residual growth rates, both of which would result in impairment charges.

Earnings Per Share Basic net earnings per common share are calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble less preferred dividends (net of related tax benefits) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net earnings per common share are calculated using the treasury stock method, on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of stock options and other stock-based awards and the assumed conversion of preferred stock. Net earnings per share were as follows: CONSOLIDATED AMOUNTS Three Months Ended March 31 Nine Months Ended March 31 2019 2018 2019 2018 Net earnings $ 2,776 $ 2,540 $ 9,203 $ 7,971 Less: Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 31 29 65 112 Net earnings attributable to P&G (Diluted) 2,745 2,511 9,138 7,859 Preferred dividends, net of tax (64 ) (74 ) (195 ) (198 ) Net earnings attributable to P&G available to common shareholders (Basic) $ 2,681 $ 2,437 $ 8,943 $ 7,661 SHARES IN MILLIONS Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 2,509.1 2,522.7 2,501.5 2,535.7 Add: Effect of dilutive securities Conversion of preferred shares (1) 89.6 94.3 90.8 95.4 Impact of stock options and other unvested equity awards (2) 39.0 28.6 32.0 37.5 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 2,637.7 2,645.6 2,624.3 2,668.6 NET EARNINGS PER SHARE (3) Basic $ 1.07 $ 0.97 $ 3.58 $ 3.02 Diluted $ 1.04 $ 0.95 $ 3.48 $ 2.94 (1) Despite being included currently in Diluted net earnings per common share, the actual conversion to common stock occurs when the preferred shares are sold. Shares may only be sold after being allocated to the ESOP participants pursuant to the repayment of the ESOP's obligations through 2035. (2) Weighted average outstanding stock options of approximately 4 million and 54 million for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 , and approximately 25 million and 24 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018 respectively, were not included in the Diluted net earnings per share calculation because the options were out of the money or to do so would have been antidilutive (i.e., the total proceeds upon exercise would have exceeded the market value of the underlying common shares). (3) Net earnings per share are calculated on Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. 6. Share-Based Compensation and Postretirement Benefits The following table provides a summary of our share-based compensation expense and postretirement benefit costs: Three Months Ended March 31 Nine Months Ended March 31 2019 2018 2019 2018 Share-based compensation expense $ 118 $ 92 $ 299 $ 249 Net periodic benefit cost for pension benefits (1) 30 53 94 156 Net periodic benefit cost/(credit) for other retiree benefits (1) (41 ) (44 ) (124 ) (120 ) (1) The components of the total net periodic benefit cost for both pension benefits and other retiree benefits for those interim periods, on an annualized basis, do not differ materially from the amounts disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 , as revised by the Form 8-K filed October 22, 2018 to update the Form 10-K to revise disclosures to reflect the adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ASU 2017-07 and 2016-18. 7. Risk Management Activities and Fair Value Measurements As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. There have been no significant changes in our risk management policies or activities during the nine months ended March 31, 2019 . The Company has not changed its valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period. The Company recognizes transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of each quarter. There were no transfers between levels during the periods presented. Also, there was no significant activity within the Level 3 assets and liabilities during the periods presented. There were no significant assets or liabilities that were remeasured at fair value on a non-recurring basis for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 . The following table sets forth the Company’s financial assets as of March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2018 that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis during the period: Fair Value Asset March 31, 2019 June 30, 2018 Investments: U.S. government securities $ 4,307 $ 5,544 Corporate bond securities 2,778 3,737 Other investments 165 141 Total $ 7,250 $ 9,422 Investment securities are presented in Available-for-sale investment securities and Other noncurrent assets. The amortized cost of U.S. government securities with maturities less than one year was $700 as of March 31, 2019 and $2,003 as of June 30, 2018 . The amortized cost of U.S. government securities with maturities between one and five years was $3,657 as of March 31, 2019 and $3,659 as of June 30, 2018 . The amortized cost of Corporate bond securities with maturities of less than a year was $1,422 as of March 31, 2019 and $1,291 as of June 30, 2018 . The amortized cost of Corporate bond securities with maturities between one and five years was $1,375 as of March 31, 2019 and $2,503 as of June 30, 2018 . The Company's investments measured at fair value are generally classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. There are no material investment balances classified as Level 1 or Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy, or that used net asset value as a practical expedient. Fair values are generally estimated based upon quoted market prices for similar instruments. The fair value of long-term debt was $24,958 and $23,402 as of March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2018 , respectively. This includes the current portion of debt instruments ( $2,310 and $1,769 as of March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2018 , respectively). Certain long-term debt (debt tied to derivatives designated as a fair value hedge) is recorded at fair value. All other long-term debt is recorded at amortized cost, but is measured at fair value for disclosure purposes. We consider our debt to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Fair values are generally estimated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. Disclosures about Financial Instruments The notional amounts and fair values of financial instruments used in hedging transactions as of March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2018 are as follows: Notional Amount Fair Value Asset Fair Value (Liability) March 31, 2019 June 30, 2018 March 31, 2019 June 30, 2018 March 31, 2019 June 30, 2018 DERIVATIVES IN FAIR VALUE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Interest rate contracts $ 4,515 $ 4,587 $ 127 $ 125 $ (16 ) $ (53 ) DERIVATIVES IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Foreign currency interest rate contracts $ 3,034 $ 1,848 $ 27 $ 41 $ (8 ) $ (75 ) TOTAL DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS $ 7,549 $ 6,435 $ 154 $ 166 $ (24 ) $ (128 ) DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS Foreign currency contracts $ 6,362 $ 7,358 $ 42 $ 30 $ (14 ) $ (56 ) TOTAL DERIVATIVES AT FAIR VALUE $ 13,911 $ 13,793 $ 196 $ 196 $ (38 ) $ (184 ) All derivative assets are presented in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Other noncurrent assets. All derivative liabilities are presented in Accrued and other liabilities or Other noncurrent liabilities. The fair value of the interest rate derivative asset/liability directly offsets the cumulative amount of the fair value hedging adjustment included in the carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation. The carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation, which includes the unamortized discount or premium and the fair value adjustment, was $4,611 and $4,639 as of March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2018 , respectively. In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges. The carrying value of those debt instruments designated as net investment hedges, which includes the adjustment for the foreign currency transaction gain or loss on those instruments, was $16,958 and $15,012 as of March 31, 2019 and June 30, 2018 , respectively. All of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Before tax gains/(losses) on our financial instruments in hedging relationships are categorized as follows: Amount of Gain/(Loss) Recognized in OCI on Derivatives Three Months Ended March 31 Nine Months Ended March 31 2019 2018 2019 2018 DERIVATIVES IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS (1) (2) Foreign exchange contracts $ 34 $ (222 ) $ 53 $ (483 ) (1) For the derivatives in net investment hedging relationships, the amount of gain/(loss) excluded from effectiveness testing, which was recognized in earnings, was $17 and $34 for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The amount of gain/(loss) excluded from effectiveness testing was $44 and $107 for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. (2) In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges. The amount of gain/(loss) recognized in AOCI for such instruments was $226 and $(535) , for the three months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The amount of gain/(loss) recognized in AOCI for such instruments was $467 and $(1,280) , for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Amount of Gain/(Loss) Recognized in Earnings Three Months Ended March 31 Nine Months Ended March 31 2019 2018 2019 2018 DERIVATIVES IN FAIR VALUE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Interest rate contracts $ 21 $ (46 ) $ 39 $ (87 ) DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS Foreign currency contracts $ 75 $ 123 $ 68 $ 121 The gain/(loss) on the derivatives in fair value hedging relationships is fully offset by the mark-to-market impact of the related exposure. These are both recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in Interest Expense. The gain/(loss) on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is substantially offset by the currency mark-to-market of the related exposure. These are both recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in SG&A. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. 8. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss) The table below presents the changes in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (AOCI), including the reclassifications out of Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) by component: Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss) by Component Hedges Investment Securities Pension and Other Retiree Benefits Financial Statement Translation Total AOCI Balance at June 30, 2018 $ (3,246 ) $ (173 ) $ (4,058 ) $ (7,272 ) $ (14,749 ) OCI before reclassifications (1) 399 109 163 (713 ) (42 ) Amounts reclassified from AOCI (2) — (2 ) 151 — 149 Net current period OCI 399 107 314 (713 ) 107 Reclassification to retained earnings in accordance with ASU 2018-02 (3) (18 ) — (308 ) — (326 ) Less: Other comprehensive income/(loss) attributable to non-controlling interests — — — Balance at March 31, 2019 $ (2,865 ) $ (66 ) $ (4,052 ) $ (7,985 ) $ (14,968 ) (1) Net of tax expense/(benefit) of $122 , $0 and $43 for gains/losses on hedges, investment securities and pension and other retiree benefit items, respectively.

The below provides additional details on amounts reclassified from AOCI into the Consolidated Statements of Earnings: • Investment securities: amounts reclassified from AOCI into Other non-operating income, net. • Pension and other retiree benefits: amounts reclassified from AOCI into Other non-operating income, net and included in the computation of net periodic postretirement costs. • Financial statement translation: amounts reclassified from AOCI into SG&A. 9. Restructuring Program The Company has historically incurred an ongoing annual level of restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Before-tax costs incurred under the ongoing program have generally ranged from $250 to $500 annually. In fiscal 2017, the Company announced specific elements of a multi-year productivity and cost savings plan to further reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, certain marketing activities and overhead expenses. This program is expected to result in incremental enrollment reductions, along with further optimization of the supply chain and other manufacturing processes. Restructuring costs incurred consist primarily of costs to separate employees, asset-related costs to exit facilities and other costs. For the three and nine month periods ended March 31, 2019 , the Company incurred total restructuring charges of $116 and $430 , respectively. Of these charges incurred, $29 and $126 were recorded in SG&A and $85 and $291 were recorded in Cost of products sold, respectively. The remainder of these charges were recorded in Other non-operating income, net. The following table presents restructuring activity for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 : Reserve Balance Charges Previously Reported (Six Months Ended December 31, 2018) Charges for the Nine Months Ended March 31, 2019 Reserve Balance June 30, 2018 Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 Cash Spent Charges Against Assets March 31, 2019 Separations $ 259 $ 109 $ 57 $ (188 ) $ — $ 237 Asset-related costs — 50 52 — (102 ) — Other costs 254 155 7 (206 ) — 210 Total $ 513 $ 314 $ 116 $ (394 ) $ (102 ) $ 447 Separation Costs Employee separation charges for the three and nine month periods ended March 31, 2019 , relate to severance packages for approximately 240 employees and 1,210 employees, respectively. The packages were predominantly voluntary and the amounts were calculated based on salary levels and past service periods. Severance costs related to voluntary separations are generally charged to earnings when the employee accepts the offer. Asset-Related Costs Asset-related costs consist of both asset write-downs and accelerated depreciation. Asset write-downs relate to the establishment of a new fair value basis for assets held-for-sale or disposal. These assets were written down to the lower of their current carrying basis or amounts expected to be realized upon disposal, less minor disposal costs. Charges for accelerated depreciation relate to long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period. These assets relate primarily to manufacturing consolidations and technology standardizations. The asset-related charges will not have a significant impact on future depreciation charges. Other Costs Other restructuring-type charges are incurred as a direct result of the restructuring program. Such charges primarily include asset removal and termination of contracts related to supply chain optimization. Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the restructuring program charges are funded by and included within Corporate for both management and segment reporting. Accordingly, all of the charges under the program are included within the Corporate reportable segment. However, for informative purposes, the following table summarizes the total restructuring costs related to our reportable segments: Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 Nine Months Ended March 31, 2019 Beauty $ 6 $ 33 Grooming 18 49 Health Care 3 15 Fabric & Home Care 15 46 Baby, Feminine & Family Care 26 117 Corporate (1) 48 170 Total Company $ 116 $ 430 (1) Corporate includes costs related to allocated overheads, including charges related to our Sales and Market Operations, Global Business Services and Corporate Functions activities. 10. Commitments and Contingencies Litigation The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business, which cover a wide range of matters such as antitrust, trade and other governmental regulations, product liability, patent and trademark, advertising, contracts, environmental, labor and employment and tax. With respect to these and other litigation and claims, while considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management and our counsel, the ultimate resolution of the various lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior manufacturing and waste disposal practices. Based on currently available information, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of environmental remediation will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Income Tax Uncertainties The Company is present in approximately 150 taxable jurisdictions and, at any point in time, has 40 – 50 jurisdictional audits underway at various stages of completion. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite our belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitations. Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate. We have tax years open ranging from 2008 and forward. We are generally not able to reliably estimate the ultimate settlement amounts until the close of the audit. While we do not expect material changes, it is possible that the amount of unrecognized benefit with respect to our uncertain tax positions could increase or decrease within the next 12 months. At this time, we are not able to make a reasonable estimate of the range of impact on the balance of uncertain tax positions or the impact on the effective tax rate related to these items. Additional information on the Commitments and Contingencies of the Company can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2018 . Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. 11. Merck Acquisition On November 30, 2018, we completed our acquisition of the over the counter (OTC) healthcare business of Merck KGaA (Merck OTC) for $3.7 billion (based on exchange rates at the time of closing) in an all-cash transaction. This business primarily sells OTC consumer healthcare products, mainly in Europe, Latin America and Asia markets. The results of Merck OTC, which are not material to the Company, are reported in our consolidated financial statements beginning December 1, 2018. Total sales for Merck OTC’s most recently completed fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 were approximately $1 billion . The following table presents the preliminary allocation of purchase price related to the Merck OTC business as of the date of acquisition. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price is based on the best estimates of management and is subject to revision based on final determination of fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired, which will be completed as we complete our analysis of the underlying assets and acquired liabilities, such as pensions, litigation cases, environmental issues, and tax positions. Amounts in millions November 30, 2018 Current assets $ 392 Property, plant and equipment 122 Intangible assets 2,111 Goodwill 2,014 Other non-current assets 144 Total Assets Acquired $ 4,783 Current liabilities $ 237 Deferred income taxes 661 Non-current liabilities 60 Total Liabilities Acquired $ 958 Noncontrolling Interest (1) $ 169 Net Assets Acquired $ 3,656 (1) Represents a 48% minority ownership interest in the Merck India company. The acquisition resulted in $2.0 billion in goodwill, of which approximately $180 million is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. All of this goodwill was allocated to the Health Care Segment. The goodwill is primarily attributable to the assembled workforce and synergies we expect to generate by combining the Merck OTC business with the Company’s existing personal health care business. We have preliminarily estimated the fair value of Merck OTC’s identifiable intangible assets as $2.1 billion . The preliminary allocation of identifiable intangible assets and their average useful lives is as follows: Amounts in millions Estimated Fair Value Avg Remaining Useful Life Intangible Assets with Determinable Lives Brands $ 701 14 Patents and technology 118 7 Customer relationships 346 20 Total $ 1,165 15 Intangible Assets with Indefinite Lives Brands 946 Total Intangible Assets $ 2,111 The majority of the intangible valuation relates to brand intangibles. Our preliminary assessment as to brand intangibles that have an indefinite life and those that have a definite life was based on a number of factors, including competitive environment, market Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. share, brand history, product life cycles, operating plan and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. The indefinite-lived brand intangibles include Neurobion and Dolo Neurobion. The definite-lived brand intangibles primarily include regional or local brands. The definite-lived brand intangibles have estimated lives ranging from 10 to 20 years. The technology intangibles are related to R&D and manufacturing know-how; these intangibles have a 7 year estimated life. The customer relationships intangibles have a 20 year estimated life and reflect the historical and projected attrition rates for Merck OTC’s relationships with health care professionals, retailers and distributors.

A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected herein, is included in the section titled “Economic Conditions and Uncertainties” and the section titled “Risk Factors” (Part II, Item 1A) of this Form 10-Q. The purpose of Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is to provide an understanding of Procter & Gamble's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. The MD&A is organized in the following sections: • Overview • Summary of Results – Nine Months Ended March 31, 2019 • Economic Conditions and Uncertainties • Results of Operations – Three and Nine Months Ended March 31, 2019 • Business Segment Discussion – Three and Nine Months Ended March 31, 2019 • Liquidity and Capital Resources • Reconciliation of Measures Not Defined by U.S. GAAP Throughout the MD&A, we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales and net earnings. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), including organic sales growth, core net earnings per share (Core EPS), adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity. The explanation at the end of the MD&A provides the definition of these non-GAAP measures as well as details on the use and the derivation of these measures. Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and market consumption in the MD&A are based on a combination of vendor purchased traditional brick-and-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales in dollar terms on a constant currency basis of our products, relative to all product sales in the category. The Company measures fiscal-year-to-date market shares through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months. OVERVIEW P&G is a global leader in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, high-frequency stores and pharmacies. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries. Our market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position. The table below provides detail on our reportable segments, including the product categories and brand composition within each segment. Reportable Segments Product Categories (Sub-Categories) Major Brands Beauty Hair Care ( Conditioner, Shampoo, Styling Aids, Treatments ) Head & Shoulders, Pantene, Rejoice Skin and Personal Care ( Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Personal Cleansing, Skin Care ) Olay, Old Spice, Safeguard, SK-II Grooming Grooming (1) (Shave Care - Female Blades & Razors, Male Blades & Razors, Pre- and Post-Shave Products, Other Shave Care; Appliances) Braun, Fusion, Gillette, Mach3, Prestobarba, Venus Health Care Oral Care ( Toothbrushes, Toothpaste, Other Oral Care ) Crest, Oral-B Personal Health Care ( Gastrointestinal, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements, Other Personal Health Care ) Metamucil, Prilosec, Vicks Fabric & Home Care Fabric Care ( Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Additives, Laundry Detergents ) Ariel, Downy, Gain, Tide Home Care ( Air Care, Dish Care, P&G Professional, Surface Care ) Cascade, Dawn, Febreze, Mr. Clean, Swiffer Baby, Feminine & Family Care Baby Care ( Baby Wipes, Diapers and Pants ) Luvs, Pampers Feminine Care ( Adult Incontinence, Feminine Care ) Always, Tampax Family Care ( Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper ) Bounty, Charmin, Puffs (1) The Grooming product category is comprised of the Shave Care and Appliances Global Business Units. The following table provides the percentage of net sales and net earnings by reportable business segment for the three and nine months ended March 31, 2019 (excluding net sales and net earnings in Corporate): Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 Nine Months Ended March 31, 2019 Net Sales Net Earnings Net Sales Net Earnings Beauty 19% 20% 19% 23% Grooming 9% 12% 9% 12% Health Care 13% 13% 12% 13% Fabric & Home Care 33% 31% 33% 29% Baby, Feminine & Family Care 26% 24% 27% 23% Total Company 100% 100% 100% 100% SUMMARY OF RESULTS Following are highlights of results for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 versus the nine months ended March 31, 2018 : • Net sales increased 1% to $50.6 billion , driven by a mid-single digits increase in Beauty and a low single digit increase in Health Care and Fabric & Home Care, partially offset by a low single digit decline in Baby, Feminine & Family Care and mid-single digit decline in Grooming. Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, increased 4% , driven by a high single digits increase in Beauty, a mid-single digits increase in Health Care and Fabric & Home Care and a low single digit increase in Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Organic sales were unchanged in Grooming. • Unit volume increased 2% , with organic volume also up 2% . Volume increased mid-single digits in Fabric & Home Care and Health Care, low single digits in Beauty and was unchanged in Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Volume decreased low single digits in Grooming. Excluding the impacts of the PGT Healthcare partnership dissolution and the Merck OTC acquisition, organic volume increased low single digits in Health Care. • Net earnings were $9.2 billion , an increase of $1.2 billion or 15% versus the prior year due to a reduction in current year income tax expense (due to the impacts of the U.S. Tax Act, comprised of the reduction in the ongoing tax rate on earnings and the base period charges related to the transitional impacts of the U.S. Tax Act) and a current year gain on the dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership, partially offset by a reduction in the operating earnings margin primarily driven by currency impacts. • Diluted net earnings per share increased 18% to $3.48 due primarily to the increase in net earnings and a reduction in shares outstanding due to share repurchases. • Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $1.3 billion or 16% versus the prior year to $9.1 billion . • Core net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble, which represents net earnings excluding the current period gain on the dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership, incremental restructuring charges in both periods and the base period charges related to the transitional impacts of the U.S. Tax Act, increased 3% to $9.0 billion. Core net earnings per share increased 4% to $3.42 due to the increase in Core net earnings and the reduction in shares outstanding. • Operating cash flow was $11.1 billion . Adjusted free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less capital expenditures and certain other impacts, was $8.8 billion . Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 99% . Adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity are defined in the section entitled ""Reconciliation of Measures not defined by U.S. GAAP."" ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES Global Economic Conditions . Our products are sold in numerous countries across North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa with more than half our sales generated outside the United States. As such, we are exposed to and impacted by global macro-economic factors, U.S. and foreign government policies and foreign exchange fluctuations. Current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic, and any causes of market size contraction, such as reduced GDP in commodity-dependent economies, greater political unrest in the Middle East, Central & Eastern Europe and the Korean peninsula, economic uncertainty related to the execution of the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, political instability in certain Latin American markets and overall economic slowdowns, could reduce our sales or erode our operating margin, in either case reducing our earnings. Changes in Costs . Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, transportation costs and our own productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp, and volatility in the market price of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs. If we are unable to manage commodity fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions, as well as through consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our gross margin, operating margin and net earnings. Sales could also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on consumption of our products. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including outsourcing projects, supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. As discussed later in this MD&A, in 2012 we initiated overhead and supply chain cost improvement projects. In fiscal 2017, we communicated specific elements of an additional multi-year cost reduction program which is resulting in enrollment reductions and other savings. If we are not successful in executing and sustaining these changes, there could be a negative impact on our operating margin and net earnings. Foreign Exchange . We have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates. Translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation of transaction-related working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. In four of the past five fiscal years, as well as the current year, the U.S. dollar has strengthened versus a number of foreign currencies leading to lower sales and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts. Certain countries experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations, like Argentina, Russia, Turkey, Brazil, China and the United Kingdom have previously had, and could in the future have, a significant impact on our sales, costs and earnings. Increased pricing in response to certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could also have a negative impact on consumption of our products, which would affect our sales and profits. Government Policies . Our net earnings could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government tax policies, for example, the U.S. Tax Act enacted in December 2017, the implications and uncertainties of which are disclosed elsewhere in this report. Additionally, we attempt to carefully manage our debt, currency and other exposures in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and pricing controls, such as Nigeria, Algeria, Egypt and Turkey. Further, our earnings and sales could be affected by changes to international trade agreements in North America and elsewhere, including increases of import tariffs, both currently effective and future potential changes. Changes in government policies in these areas might cause an increase or decrease in our sales, operating margin and net earnings. For information on risk factors that could impact our results, please refer to “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Three Months Ended March 31, 2019 The following discussion provides a review of results for the three months ended March 31, 2019 versus the three months ended March 31, 2018 . Three Months Ended March 31 Amounts in millions, except per share amounts 2019 2018 % Chg Net sales $16,462 $16,281 1% Operating income 3,229 3,209 1% Net earnings 2,776 2,540 9% Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 2,745 2,511 9% Diluted net earnings per common share 1.04 0.95 9% Core net earnings per common share 1.06 1.00 6% Three Months Ended March 31 COMPARISONS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES 2019 2018 Basis Pt Chg Gross profit 48.8% 48.5% 30 Selling, general & administrative expense 29.2% 28.8% 40 Operating income 19.6% 19.7% (10) Earnings before income taxes 19.9% 20.0% (10) Net earnings 16.9% 15.6% 130 Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 16.7% 15.4% 130 Net Sales Net sales for the quarter increased 1% to $16.5 billion including a 5% negative impact from foreign exchange. Unit volume increased 3% . Excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures, organic volume increased 2%. Increased pricing had a 2% favorable impact to net sales. Mix was a 1% positive impact to net sales, driven by disproportionate growth of the Skin & Personal Care category (behind the super-premium SK-II brand) and developed regions, each of which have higher than company average selling prices. Volume increased high-single digits in Health Care, increased mid-single digits in Fabric & Home Care, increased low single digits in Beauty and was unchanged in Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Volume decreased low-single digits in Grooming. Excluding the impacts of the PGT Healthcare partnership dissolution and Merck OTC acquisition, Health Care organic volume increased low single digits. Volume increased low single digits in both developed and developing regions. Organic sales increased 5% on a 2% increase in organic volume.

(2) Other includes the sales mix impact from acquisitions and divestitures, the impact from the July 1, 2018 adoption of new accounting standards for ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers"" and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile volume to net sales. Operating Costs Gross margin increased 30 basis points to 48.8% of net sales for the quarter. Gross margin benefited from 160 basis points of gross manufacturing cost savings projects (130 basis points net of product and packaging reinvestments), 80 basis points of positive pricing impacts and 30 basis points from lower restructuring costs. These impacts were offset by: • a 70 basis point decline due to higher commodity costs, • a 60 basis point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange and • an 80 basis point net decline from unfavorable product mix and other impacts (primarily mix within segments due to the growth of lower margin products forms and club channel in certain categories and due to the disproportionate growth of the Fabric Care category which is one of our largest categories and has lower than company-average margins). Total SG&A spending increased 3% to $4.8 billion due to increases in overhead costs and other operating costs, partially offset by a reduction in marketing spending. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased 40 basis points to 29.2% due to the increase in overhead and other operating costs, partially offset by the impacts of the reductions in marketing spending as a percentage of net sales. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 50 basis points due to the positive scale impacts of the organic net sales increase, savings in agency compensation, production costs and advertising spending, and the impact of adopting the new standard on ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers"" which prospectively reclassified certain customer spending from marketing (SG&A) expense to a reduction of net sales. These reductions were partially offset by reinvestments in media and other marketing spending. Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales increased 40 basis points as the positive scale impacts of the organic net sales increase and productivity savings were more than offset by inflation, Merck OTC related overhead spending and other costs. Other net operating costs as a percentage of net sales increased approximately 50 basis points due to an increase in foreign exchange transaction charges and the net impact of changes in indirect tax reserves. Productivity-driven cost savings delivered 100 basis points of benefit in SG&A. Non-Operating Expenses and Income Interest expense was $131 million for the quarter, a marginal decrease versus the prior year period. Interest income was $52 million for the quarter, a $17 million decrease versus the prior year period due to a reduction in investment securities. Other non-operating income was $128 million , an increase of $20 million versus the prior year period due to lower pension related costs versus the base period. Income Taxes For the three months ended March 31, 2019 the effective tax rate decreased 660 basis points versus the prior year period to 15.3% due to: • a 540 basis-point reduction from the impact of the lower blended U.S. federal tax rate on current year earnings versus the prior year rate due to the phased in rate impact of the U.S. Tax Act in the prior year caused by our June 30 fiscal year-end, • a 180 basis-point reduction from higher excess tax benefits from share-based compensation (240 basis points in the current year versus 60 basis points in the prior year), • a 70 basis-point reduction due to prior year transitional impacts from the U.S. Tax Act, • a 70 basis-point increase from discrete impacts related to uncertain tax positions (40 basis points of unfavorable impact in the current year versus 30 basis points of favorable impact in the prior year), • a 60 basis-point increase from unfavorable impacts from geographic mix of earnings. Net Earnings Net earnings increased $236 million or 9% to $2.8 billion for the quarter . The tax rate reduction discussed above drove a $211 million increase in net earnings. This tax benefit, along with the increase in net sales and the increased gross margin were partially offset by the increase in SG&A spending, all of which are discussed above. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of $245 million on net earnings for the quarter, including both transactional charges and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars. Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $234 million or 9% to $2.7 billion for the quarter. Diluted net earnings per share increased 9% to $1.04 . Core net earnings per share increased 6% to $1.06 . Core net earnings per share represents diluted net earnings per share excluding the transitional impacts from the U.S. Tax Act in the base period and incremental restructuring charges in both periods related to our productivity and cost savings plans. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Nine Months Ended March 31, 2019 The following discussion provides a review of results for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 versus the nine months ended March 31, 2018 .

Unit volume increased 2% . Pricing was a 1% positive impact to net sales. Mix was a 1% positive impact to net sales, driven by disproportionate organic growth of the Skin and Personal Care and Personal Health Care categories and developed regions, all of which have higher than company average selling prices. Volume increased mid-single digits in Fabric & Home Care and Health Care and increased low single digits in Beauty. Volume was unchanged in Baby, Feminine & Family Care and decreased low single digits in Grooming. Excluding the impacts of the PGT Healthcare partnership dissolution and Merck OTC acquisition, Health Care organic volume increased low single digits. Volume increased low single digits in developed and developing regions. Organic sales increased 4% on a 2% increase in organic volume.

(2) Other includes the sales mix impact from acquisitions and divestitures, the impact from the July 1, 2018 adoption of new accounting standards for ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers"" and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile volume to net sales. Operating Costs Gross margin decreased 70 basis points to 48.9% of net sales for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 . Gross margin benefited from 140 basis points of gross manufacturing cost savings projects (110 basis points net of product and packaging reinvestments) and 40 basis points of positive pricing impacts. This was more than offset by: • a 90 basis point decline due to higher commodity costs, • a 70 basis point decline from unfavorable product mix and other impacts (primarily mix within segments due to the growth of lower margin products forms and club channels in certain categories and due to the disproportionate growth of the Fabric Care category which has lower than company-average margins) and • a 60 basis point decline from the impact of unfavorable foreign exchange Total SG&A spending decreased 1% to $14.1 billion primarily due to decreases in marketing spending. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 40 basis points to 27.8% as the impact of the reduction in marketing spending was partially offset by an increase in other net operating costs as a percentage of net sales. Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales was relatively unchanged as productivity savings and fixed cost leverage from increased net sales were offset by the impact of inflation and other cost increases, including the overhead costs of the Merck OTC acquisition. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 90 basis points due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase, savings in agency compensation, production costs and advertising spending, and the impact of adopting the new standard on ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers"" which prospectively reclassified certain customer spending from marketing (SG&A) expense to a reduction of net sales. Other net operating costs as a percentage of net sales increased 50 basis points primarily due to an increase in foreign exchange transactional charges and the net impact of changes in indirect tax reserves. Productivity-driven cost savings delivered 80 basis points of benefit in SG&A. Non-Operating Expenses and Income Interest expense was $398 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 , an increase of $28 million versus the prior year period due to an increase in debt and in weighted average interest rates. Interest income was $168 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2019 , a reduction of $16 million versus the prior year period due to a reduction in investment securities. Other non-operating income was $685 million , an increase of $238 million versus the prior year period primarily due to the $355 million before-tax gain from the dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership in the current year, partially offset by the impact of minor brand divestiture gains in the base period. Income Taxes For the nine months ended March 31, 2019 the effective tax rate decreased 1,050 basis points versus the prior year period to 17.3% due to: • a 590 basis-point reduction due to prior year transitional impacts from the U.S. Tax Act, • a 470 basis-point reduction from the impact of the lower blended U.S. federal tax rate on current year earnings versus the prior year rate due to the phased in rate impact of the U.S. Tax Act in the prior year caused by our June 30 fiscal year-end, • an 80 basis-point reduction from higher excess tax benefits from share-based compensation (140 basis points in the current year versus 60 basis points in the prior year), • a 60 basis-point reduction from the tax impact of the gain on the dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership, • a 10 basis-point increase from reduced favorable discrete impacts related to uncertain tax positions (10 basis points in the current year versus 20 basis points in the prior year), • a 140 basis-point increase from unfavorable impacts from geographic mix of earnings. Net Earnings Net earnings increased $1.2 billion or 15% to $9.2 billion for the nine months ended March 31, 2019. The tax rate reduction discussed above drove a $1.1 billion increase in net earnings. This tax benefit, along with the current period gain on the dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership, and the benefits from the net sales increase and the decrease in SG&A spending, were partially offset by the decrease in gross margin, all of which are discussed above. Foreign exchange had a $729 million negative impact on net earnings for the fiscal year to date period, including both transactional charges and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars. Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $1.3 billion or 16% to $9.1 billion. Diluted net earnings per share increased 18% to $3.48 . The difference between the change in net earnings and diluted net earnings per share was due to a reduction in the number of weighted average shares outstanding. Core net earnings per share increased 4% to $3.42 . Core net earnings per share represents diluted net earnings per share excluding the current period gain on the dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership, incremental restructuring charges in both periods related to our productivity and cost savings plans and the base period charges related to the transitional impacts of the U.S. Tax Act.

Excluding the impact of minor brand acquisitions, developed regions volume was unchanged. Volume increased mid-single digits in developing regions due to premium innovation and increased marketing spending. Global market share of the Skin and Personal Care category was unchanged . Net earnings increased 13% to $551 million due to the increase in net sales and a 140 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. The net earnings margin increased primarily due to a lower tax rate. A reduction in gross margin was largely offset by a decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. The gross margin reduction was primarily driven by negative mix impacts in Hair Care category (driven by disproportionate growth of certain countries and large sizes which have lower than segment-average margins) and negative foreign exchange impacts, partially offset by the benefit of increased pricing. The reduction in SG&A as a percentage of sales was primarily driven by reduced marketing spending due to the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and the impacts of adopting the new accounting standard on ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers."" The reduction in the tax rate was due to the impacts of the U.S. Tax Act, both from the overall rate reduction and the manner in which the impacts were allocated between the business and corporate segments in the prior year (See the Corporate segment discussion below). Nine months ended March 31, 2019 compared with nine months ended March 31, 2018 Beauty fiscal year to date net sales increased 4% to $9.7 billion on a 2% increase in unit volume .

Global market share of the Skin and Personal Care category was unchanged . Net earnings increased 17% to $2.1 billion due to the increase in net sales and a 230 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. The net earnings margin increased due to a decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales and a reduction in U.S. income tax rates. Gross margin was relatively unchanged as the benefits of increased pricing were offset by negative foreign exchange impacts. The reduction in SG&A as a percentage of sales was primarily driven by a reduction in marketing spending caused by the fixed cost leverage of increased net sales and the impacts of adopting the new accounting standard on ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers."" The reduction in the tax rate was due to the impacts of the U.S. Tax Act, both from the overall rate reduction and the manner in which the impacts were allocated between the business and corporate segments in the prior year (See the Corporate segment discussion below). Grooming Three months ended March 31, 2019 compared with three months ended March 31, 2018 Grooming net sales decreased 8% to $1.4 billion during the third fiscal quarter on a 3% decrease in unit volume .

Global market share of the Appliances category decreased more than a point . Net earnings increased 3% to $344 million due to a 270 basis-point increase in net earnings margin, partially offset by the reduction in net sales. Net earnings margin increased due to a reduction in the effective tax rate, partially offset by a reduction in gross margin and an increase in SG&A as a percentage of net sales. Gross margin declined due to the negative impact of unfavorable mix (due to the disproportionate growth of club channel, disposable razors and lower tier products in Appliances category which have lower than segment average margins) and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, partially offset by the positive impacts of manufacturing cost savings and increased pricing. SG&A as a percentage of net sales increased due to the negative scale impacts of the net sales decrease partially offset by reductions in overhead costs due to productivity savings and reduced marketing costs caused by the impacts from adoption of the new accounting standard on ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers."" The reduction in the tax rate was primarily due to the impacts of the U.S. Tax Act, both from the overall rate reduction and the manner in which the impacts were allocated between the business and corporate segments in the prior year (See the Corporate segment discussion below), and the impact of favorable adjustments to reserves for uncertain tax positions.

Gross margin decreased primarily due to an increase in commodity costs and unfavorable foreign exchange impacts, partially offset by manufacturing cost savings projects. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased due to reduced marketing spending and overhead costs, driven by productivity savings and the impacts from adoption of the new accounting standard on ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers."" The reduction in the tax rate was due to the impacts of the U.S. Tax Act, both from the overall rate reduction and the manner in which the impacts were allocated between the business and corporate segments in the prior year (See the Corporate segment discussion below). Corporate Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business segments. These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level; financing and investing activities; certain employee benefit costs; other general corporate items; the gains and losses related to certain divested brands and categories; certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the segments to U.S. GAAP. The most significant reconciling item includes income taxes to adjust from blended statutory rates that are reflected in the segments to the overall Company effective tax rate. Corporate net sales decreased $20 million to $ 123 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2019 and decreased $10 million to $368 million for the fiscal year to date. Corporate net earnings decreased $216 million in the quarter primarily due to the impact of the allocation methodology of the lower U.S. tax rates (in the prior year the net benefit was held in Corporate, whereas the lower rates are included in the reporting segments in the current year). Fiscal year to date Corporate net earnings increased $52 million due to higher current year divestiture gains (driven by the current year gain on the dissolution of the PGT healthcare partnership) and a $98 million reduction in income tax expense (driven by the net impact of the base period charges for the transitional impacts of the U.S. Tax Act, partially offset by the manner in which the impacts of the lower U.S. tax rates were allocated between the corporate and business segments as explained above), partially offset by higher current year foreign exchange transactional charges (discussed earlier in the Results of Operations section) and higher unallocated SG&A costs in the current year. Restructuring Program to deliver Productivity and Cost Savings In 2012, the Company initiated a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs and better leverage scale in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overheads. The plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes to fund the Company's growth strategy. In 2017, the Company communicated specific elements of an additional multi-year productivity and cost savings program. The current productivity and cost savings plan will further reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, certain marketing activities and overhead expenses. As part of this plan, the Company incurred $1.1 billion in total before-tax restructuring costs in fiscal 2018, with an additional amount of approximately $0.7 billion expected in fiscal 2019. This program is expected to result in additional enrollment reductions, along with further optimization of the supply chain and other manufacturing processes. Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the resulting charges are funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting. In addition to our restructuring programs, we have additional ongoing savings efforts in our supply chain, marketing and overhead areas that yield additional benefits to our operating margins. Refer to Note 9 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the restructuring program. LIQUIDITY & CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating Activities We generated $11.1 billion of cash from operating activities fiscal year to date, an increase of approximately $423 million versus the prior year. Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, deferred income taxes, and gain on sale of assets), generated $11.1 billion of operating cash flow. Working capital and other impacts had no net impact on operating cash flow in the period. Accounts receivable increased, using $549 million of cash due to sales growth and to a lesser extent, the timing of the quarter-end (which fell on a Sunday, resulting in fewer days collection). Inventory consumed $601 million of cash primarily due to product initiatives and to support business growth. Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities increased, generating $1.4 billion of cash primarily driven by an increase in payables to support the increase in inventory, increased marketing accruals based on timing of spending and extended payment terms with our suppliers. All other operating assets and liabilities used $537 million of cash, driven primarily by payment of the current year portion of taxes due related to the U.S. Tax Act and statutory pension contributions. Investing Activities Investing activities used $4.1 billion of cash fiscal year to date. Capital expenditures were $2.5 billion , or 5.0% of net sales. Acquisition activity used $3.9 billion of cash, primarily related to the Merck OTC acquisition. We used $159 million for purchases of short-term investments and received $2.5 billion of cash from sales and maturities of short-term investments. Financing Activities Our financing activities consumed net cash of $6.7 billion fiscal year to date. We used $3.3 billion for treasury stock purchases and $5.6 billion for dividends. Cash used from the net effect of debt issuances and payments was $466 million . Cash from the exercise of stock options and other impacts generated $2.6 billion of cash. As of March 31, 2019 , our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $6.1 billion . We have short- and long-term debt to meet our financing needs. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements. RECONCILIATION OF MEASURES NOT DEFINED BY U.S. GAAP In accordance with the SEC's Regulation G, the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measures. We believe that these measures provide useful perspective on underlying business results and trends (i.e., trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and provide a supplemental measure of year-on-year results. The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measure, but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted. Organic sales growth : Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures, the impact from the July 1, 2018 adoption of new accounting standards for ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers"" and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. The impact of the adoption of the new accounting standard for Revenue from Contracts with Customers is driven by the prospective reclassification of certain customer spending from marketing (SG&A) expense to a reduction of Net sales. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. This measure is used in assessing achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. Adjusted free cash flow : Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the comprehensive U.S. legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017 (the U.S. Tax Act). Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. Management views adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments. Adjusted free cash flow productivity : Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the gain on dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership, which is non-recurring and not considered indicative of underlying cash flow performance. Management views adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G’s ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. This measure is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. The Company's long-term target is to generate annual adjusted free cash flow productivity at or above 90 percent. Core EPS : Core earnings per share, or Core EPS, is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share adjusted as indicated. Management views this non-GAAP measure as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time. This measure is also used when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation. The Core earnings measures included in the following reconciliation tables refer to the equivalent GAAP measures adjusted as applicable for the following items: Incremental Restructuring : The Company has had and continues to have an ongoing level of restructuring activities. Such activities have resulted in ongoing annual restructuring related charges of approximately $250 - $500 million before tax. In 2012, the Company began a $10 billion strategic productivity and cost savings initiative that included incremental restructuring activities. In 2017, we communicated details of an additional multi-year productivity and cost savings plan. This results in incremental restructuring charges to accelerate productivity efforts and cost savings. The adjustment to Core earnings includes only the restructuring costs above what we believe are the normal recurring level of restructuring costs. Transitional Impact of U.S. Tax Reform : As discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “U.S. Tax Act”) in December 2017. This resulted in a net charge of $650 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2018, comprised of an estimated repatriation tax charge of $3.9 billion and a net deferred tax benefit of $3.2 billion. The adjustment to core earnings only includes this transitional impact. It does not include the ongoing impacts of the lower U.S. statutory rate on current year earnings. Gain on Dissolution of PGT Healthcare Partnership: The Company finalized the dissolution of our PGT Healthcare partnership, a venture between the Company and Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries, Ltd. (Teva) in the OTC consumer healthcare business, in the quarter ended September 30, 2018. The transaction was accounted for as a sale of the Teva portion of the PGT business; the Company recognized an after-tax gain on the dissolution of $353 million. We do not view the above items to be part of our sustainable results and their exclusion from Core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results. These items are also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation.

THE PROCTER & GAMBLE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 1. Basis of Presentation These statements should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 and the Form 8-K filed October 22, 2018 to update the Form 10-K to revise disclosures to reflect the adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ASU 2017-07 and 2016-18. For additional details on the impacts of adoption, see Note 2. In the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited Consolidated Financial Statements of The Procter & Gamble Company and subsidiaries (the ""Company,"" ""Procter & Gamble,"" ""P&G,"" ""we"" or ""our"") contain all adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods reported. However, the results of operations included in such financial statements may not necessarily be indicative of annual results. 2. New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies and U.S. Tax Reform On July 1, 2018 , we adopted ASU 2014-09, ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)."" This guidance outlines a single, comprehensive model of accounting for revenue from contracts with customers. We adopted the standard using the modified retrospective transition method, under which prior periods were not revised to reflect the impacts of the new standard. Our revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished product to customers. Those sales predominantly contain a single delivery element and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when ownership, risks and rewards transfer. Accordingly, the timing of revenue recognition is not materially impacted by the new standard. Trade promotions, consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances, in-store merchandising funds, advertising and other promotional activities, and consumer coupons, are offered through various programs to customers and consumers. The adoption of the new standard impacts the accrual timing for certain portions of our customer and consumer promotional spending, which resulted in a cumulative adjustment to Retained earnings of $ 534 , net of tax, on the date of adoption. The provisions of the new standard also impact the classification of certain payments to customers, moving an immaterial amount of such payments from expense to a deduction from net sales. Had this standard been effective and adopted during fiscal 2018, the impact would have been to reclassify $ 157 from Selling, General and Administrative expense (SG&A) to a reduction of Net sales for the six months ended December 31, 2017 and $ 309 for the year ended June 30, 2018 , with no impact to operating profit. This guidance included practical expedients, none of which are material to our Consolidated Financial Statements. This new guidance does not have any other material impacts on our Consolidated Financial Statements, including financial disclosures. On July 1, 2018, we adopted ASU 2017-07, ""Compensation-Retirement Benefits: Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost (Topic 715)."" This guidance requires an entity to disaggregate the current service cost component from the other components of net benefit costs in the face of the income statement. It requires the service cost component to be presented with other current compensation costs for the related employees in the operating section of the income statement, with other components of net benefit cost presented outside of income from operations. We adopted the standard retrospectively, using the practical expedient which allows entities to use information previously disclosed in their pension and other postretirement benefit plans footnote as the basis to apply the retrospective presentation requirements. As such, prior periods’ results have been revised to report the other components of net defined benefit costs, previously reported in Cost of products sold and SG&A, in Other non-operating income, net. In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-18, ""Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash (Topic 230)."" This guidance requires the Statement of Cash Flows to present changes in the total of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. Prior to the adoption of this ASU, the relevant accounting guidance did not require the Statement of Cash Flows to include changes in restricted cash. We adopted the standard retrospectively on July 1, 2018. We currently have no significant restricted cash balances. Historically, we had restricted cash balances and changes related to divestiture activity. Such balances were presented as Current assets held for sale on the balance sheets, with changes presented as Investing activities on the Statements of Cash Flow. In accordance with ASU 2016-08, such balances are now included in the beginning and ending balances of Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash for all periods presented. In February 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-02, ""Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Topic 220)."" This guidance permits companies to make an election to reclassify stranded tax effects from the recently enacted U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) to Retained earnings. ASU 2018-02 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company elected to early adopt this guidance in the quarter ended September 30, 2018. The reclassification from the adoption of this standard resulted in an increase of $ 326 to Retained earnings and a decrease of $ 326 to AOCI. In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-16, ""Income Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity transfers of Assets other than Inventory."" The standard eliminates the prohibition in ASC 740 against the immediate recognition of the current and deferred income tax effects of intra-entity transfers of assets other than inventory. We have adopted this standard effective July 1, 2018 on a modified Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. retrospective basis. The adoption of ASU 2016-16 did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements, including the cumulative effect adjustment required upon adoption. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, ""Leases (Topic 842)."" The standard requires lessees to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet and requires expanded disclosures about leasing arrangements. In July 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-11, “Leases (Topic 842) Targeted Improvements”. The updated guidance provides an optional transition method, which allows for the application of the standard as of the adoption date with no restatement of prior period amounts. We plan to adopt the standard on July 1, 2019 under the optional transition method described above. We are currently in the process of implementing lease accounting software as well as assessing the impact that the new standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements, which will consist primarily of a balance sheet gross up of our operating leases to show equal and offsetting lease assets and lease liabilities. In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-04, ""Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (Topic 350): Simplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment."" The standard simplifies the accounting for goodwill impairment by requiring a goodwill impairment to be measured using a single step impairment model, whereby the impairment equals the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the specified reporting units in their entirety. This eliminates the second step of the current impairment model that requires companies to first estimate the fair value of all assets in a reporting unit and measure impairments based on those fair values and a residual measurement approach. It also specifies that any loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. We will adopt the standard no later than July 1, 2020. The impact of the new standard will be dependent on the specific facts and circumstances of future individual impairments, if any. No other new accounting pronouncement issued or effective during the fiscal year had, or is expected to have, a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. U.S. Tax Reform On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the ""U.S. Tax Act""). The U.S. Tax Act significantly revises the future ongoing U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things, lowering the U.S. corporate income tax rates and implementing a hybrid territorial tax system. As the Company has a June 30 fiscal year-end, the lower corporate income tax rate was phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal rate of approximately 28 % for our fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 , and 21 % for subsequent fiscal years. However, the U.S. Tax Act eliminates the domestic manufacturing deduction and moves to a hybrid territorial system, which also largely eliminates the ability to credit certain foreign taxes that existed prior to enactment of the U.S. Tax Act. There are also certain transitional impacts of the U.S. Tax Act. As part of the transition to the new hybrid territorial tax system, the U.S. Tax Act imposed a one-time repatriation tax on deemed repatriation of historical earnings of foreign subsidiaries. In addition, the reduction of the U.S. corporate tax rate caused us to adjust our U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities to the lower federal base rate of 21 % . These transitional impacts resulted in a provisional net charge of $ 602 million for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 , and $ 628 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 (the quarter of enactment), comprised of an estimated repatriation tax charge of $ 3.8 billion (comprised of U.S. repatriation taxes and foreign withholding taxes) and an estimated net deferred tax benefit of $ 3.2 billion . We have finalized our assessment of the transitional impacts of the U.S. Tax Act, which did not have a significant impact on tax expense during the six months ended December 31, 2018 . Any legislative changes, including the final Section 965 transition tax regulations issued on January 15, 2019, whose impact is currently being assessed due to the complexity and interdependency of the legislative provisions, as well as any other new or proposed Treasury regulations, which have yet to be issued, may result in additional income tax impacts which could be material in the period any such changes are enacted. 3. Segment Information Under U.S. GAAP, our Global Business Units (GBUs) are aggregated into five reportable segments: 1) Beauty, 2) Grooming, 3) Health Care, 4) Fabric & Home Care and 5) Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Our five reportable segments are comprised of: • Beauty : Hair Care (Conditioner, Shampoo, Styling Aids, Treatments); Skin and Personal Care (Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Personal Cleansing, Skin Care); • Grooming : Shave Care (Female Blades & Razors, Male Blades & Razors, Pre- and Post-Shave Products, Other Shave Care); Appliances • Health Care : Oral Care (Toothbrushes, Toothpaste, Other Oral Care); Personal Health Care (Gastrointestinal, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements, Other Personal Health Care); • Fabric & Home Care : Fabric Care (Fabric Enhancers, Laundry Additives, Laundry Detergents); Home Care (Air Care, Dish Care, P&G Professional, Surface Care); and • Baby, Feminine & Family Care : Baby Care (Baby Wipes, Diapers and Pants); Feminine Care (Adult Incontinence, Feminine Care); Family Care (Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper). Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. Our business units are comprised of similar product categories. Nine business units individually accounted for 5% or more of consolidated net sales as follows: % of Net sales by Business Unit (1) Three Months Ended December 31 Six Months Ended December 31 2018 2017 2018 2017 Fabric Care 22 % 21 % 22 % 22 % Baby Care 12 % 13 % 12 % 13 % Home Care 10 % 10 % 10 % 10 % Skin and Personal Care 10 % 9 % 10 % 9 % Hair Care 9 % 10 % 10 % 10 % Family Care 9 % 8 % 9 % 8 % Oral Care 9 % 9 % 8 % 8 % Shave Care 7 % 8 % 8 % 8 % Feminine Care 6 % 6 % 6 % 6 % All Other 6 % 6 % 5 % 6 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % (1) % of Net sales by business unit excludes sales held in Corporate.

Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill is allocated by reportable segment as follows: Beauty Grooming Health Care Fabric & Home Care Baby, Feminine & Family Care Total Company Goodwill at June 30, 2018 $ 12,992 $ 19,820 $ 5,929 $ 1,865 $ 4,569 $ 45,175 Acquisitions and divestitures 132 — 1,955 6 — 2,093 Translation and other ( 116 ) ( 135 ) ( 36 ) ( 13 ) ( 36 ) ( 336 ) Goodwill at December 31, 2018 $ 13,008 $ 19,685 $ 7,848 $ 1,858 $ 4,533 $ 46,932 Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. Goodwill from current year acquisitions primarily reflects the acquisition of the over-the-counter (OTC) healthcare business of Merck KGaA (Merck OTC) in the Health Care reportable segment (see Note 11), along with other minor acquisitions in the Beauty and Fabric & Home Care reportable segments. Goodwill increases due to acquisitions was partially offset by the divestiture of the Teva portion of the PGT business in the Health Care reportable segment and currency translation. Identifiable intangible assets at December 31, 2018 were comprised of: Gross Carrying Amount Accumulated Amortization Intangible assets with determinable lives $ 8,580 $ ( 5,251 ) Intangible assets with indefinite lives 22,618 — Total identifiable intangible assets $ 31,198 $ ( 5,251 ) Intangible assets with determinable lives consist of brands, patents, technology and customer relationships. The intangible assets with indefinite lives consist of brands. The amortization expense of intangible assets for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $ 81 and $ 75 , respectively. For the six months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 , the amortization expense of intangible assets was $ 154 and $ 152 , respectively. Goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are tested annually for impairment. The test to evaluate goodwill for impairment is a two-step process. In the first step, we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we perform a second step to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill. The second step of the impairment analysis requires a valuation of a reporting unit's tangible and intangible assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the allocation of purchase price in a business combination. If the resulting implied fair value of the reporting unit's goodwill is less than its carrying value, that difference represents an impairment. The business unit valuations used to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment are dependent on a number of significant estimates and assumptions, including macroeconomic conditions, overall category growth rates, competitive activities, cost containment, margin expansion and Company business plans. We believe these estimates and assumptions are reasonable. However, future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates or future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. Our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets occurs during the 3 months ended December 31. Most of our goodwill reporting units are comprised of a combination of legacy and acquired businesses and as a result have fair value cushions that, at a minimum, exceed two times their underlying carrying values. Certain of our goodwill reporting units, in particular Shave Care and Appliances, are comprised entirely of acquired businesses and as a result, have fair value cushions that are not as high. Both of these wholly acquired reporting units have fair value cushions that currently equal or exceed the underlying carrying values. However, the overall Shave Care goodwill cushion has been reduced in recent years, with the fair value in the current year being reduced to an amount that approximates the reporting unit's carrying value. The related Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset cushion has also been reduced to below 5 % . These reductions are due in large part to an increased competitive market environment in the U.S. and certain other markets, a deceleration of category growth caused by changing grooming habits and significant currency devaluations in a number of countries relative to the U.S. dollar, which collectively have resulted in reduced cash flow projections. The current year reduction in the fair value was primarily caused by further currency devaluations, along with competitive activities. As a result of these factors and the reduction in the fair values and related cushions, goodwill for the Shave Care reporting unit and the related indefinite-lived intangible asset are more susceptible to impairment risk. The most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair values of Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the net sales and earnings growth rates (including residual growth rates) and discount rate. The residual growth rate represents the expected rate at which the reporting unit and Gillette brand are expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period. The residual growth rate utilized in our fair value estimates is consistent with the reporting unit and brand operating plans, and approximates expected long term category market growth rates. The residual growth rate is dependent on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, relative currency exchange rates and business activities that impact market share. As a result, the residual growth rate could be adversely impacted by a sustained deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes, devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or an increased competitive environment. The discount rate, which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, such as further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar. Spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the U.S. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. While management can and has implemented strategies to address these events, changes in operating plans or adverse changes in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair values and could result in a decline in fair value that would trigger future impairment charges of the reporting unit's goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. As of December 31, 2018 , the carrying values of Shave Care goodwill and the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset were $ 19.4 billion and $ 15.7 billion , respectively. The table below provides a sensitivity analysis for the Shave Care reporting unit and the Gillette indefinite lived intangible asset, utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the shorter term and residual growth rates and the discount rate, to demonstrate the potential impacts to the estimated fair values. The table below provides, in isolation, the estimated fair value impacts related to a 25 basis point increase to discount rate or a 25 basis point decrease to our shorter-term and residual growth rates, both of which would result in impairment charges.

Earnings Per Share Basic net earnings per common share are calculated by dividing Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble less preferred dividends (net of related tax benefits) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net earnings per common share are calculated using the treasury stock method on the basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the dilutive effect of stock options and other stock-based awards and the assumed conversion of preferred stock. Net earnings per share were as follows: CONSOLIDATED AMOUNTS Three Months Ended December 31 Six Months Ended December 31 2018 2017 2018 2017 Net earnings $ 3,216 $ 2,561 $ 6,427 $ 5,431 Less: Net earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests 22 66 34 83 Net earnings attributable to P&G (Diluted) 3,194 2,495 6,393 5,348 Preferred dividends, net of tax ( 65 ) ( 62 ) ( 131 ) ( 124 ) Net earnings attributable to P&G available to common shareholders (Basic) $ 3,129 $ 2,433 $ 6,262 $ 5,224 SHARES IN MILLIONS Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 2,499.7 2,533.9 2,497.8 2,542.2 Add: Effect of dilutive securities Conversion of preferred shares (1) 90.7 95.5 91.3 96.0 Impact of stock options and other unvested equity awards (2) 32.6 40.2 28.5 41.9 Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 2,623.0 2,669.6 2,617.6 2,680.1 NET EARNINGS PER SHARE (3) Basic $ 1.25 $ 0.96 $ 2.51 $ 2.05 Diluted $ 1.22 $ 0.93 $ 2.44 $ 2.00 (1) Despite being included currently in Diluted net earnings per common share, the actual conversion to common stock occurs when the preferred shares are sold. Shares may only be sold after being allocated to the ESOP participants pursuant to the repayment of the ESOP's obligations through 2035. (2) Weighted average outstanding stock options of approximately 23 million and 24 million for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 , and approximately 35 million and 22 million for the six months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 respectively, were not included in the Diluted net earnings per share calculation because the options were out of the money or to do so would have been antidilutive (i.e., the total proceeds upon exercise would have exceeded the market value of the underlying common shares). (3) Net earnings per share are calculated on Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. 6. Share-Based Compensation and Postretirement Benefits The following table provides a summary of our share-based compensation expense and postretirement benefit costs: Three Months Ended December 31 Six Months Ended December 31 2018 2017 2018 2017 Share-based compensation expense $ 79 $ 73 $ 181 $ 157 Net periodic benefit cost for pension benefits (1) 36 52 64 103 Net periodic benefit cost/(credit) for other retiree benefits (1) ( 42 ) ( 38 ) ( 83 ) ( 76 ) (1) The components of the total net periodic benefit cost for both pension benefits and other retiree benefits for those interim periods, on an annualized basis, do not differ materially from the amounts disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018 , as revised by the Form 8-K filed October 22, 2018 to update the Form 10-K to revise disclosures to reflect the adoption of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ASU 2017-07 and 2016-18. 7. Risk Management Activities and Fair Value Measurements As a multinational company with diverse product offerings, we are exposed to market risks, such as changes in interest rates, currency exchange rates and commodity prices. There have been no significant changes in our risk management policies or activities during the six months ended December 31, 2018 . The Company has not changed its valuation techniques used in measuring the fair value of any financial assets and liabilities during the period. The Company recognizes transfers between levels within the fair value hierarchy, if any, at the end of each quarter. There were no transfers between levels during the periods presented. Also, there was no significant activity within the Level 3 assets and liabilities during the periods presented. There were no significant assets or liabilities that were remeasured at fair value on a non-recurring basis for the six months ended December 31, 2018 . The following table sets forth the Company’s financial assets as of December 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018 that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis during the period: Fair Value Asset December 31, 2018 June 30, 2018 Investments: U.S. government securities $ 5,177 $ 5,544 Corporate bond securities 3,244 3,737 Other investments 163 141 Total $ 8,584 $ 9,422 Investment securities are presented in Available-for-sale investment securities and Other noncurrent assets. The amortized cost of U.S. government securities with maturities less than one year was $ 1,601 as of December 31, 2018 and $ 2,003 as of June 30, 2018 . The amortized cost of U.S. government securities with maturities between one and five years was $ 3,657 as of December 31, 2018 and $ 3,659 as of June 30, 2018 . The amortized cost of Corporate bond securities with maturities of less than a year was $ 1,525 as of December 31, 2018 and $ 1,291 as of June 30, 2018 . The amortized cost of Corporate bond securities with maturities between one and five years was $ 1,760 as of December 31, 2018 and $ 2,503 as of June 30, 2018 . The Company's investments measured at fair value are generally classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. There are no material investment balances classified as Level 1 or Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy, or that used net asset value as a practical expedient. Fair values are generally estimated based upon quoted market prices for similar instruments. The fair value of long-term debt was $ 24,602 and $ 23,402 as of December 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018 , respectively. This includes the current portion of debt instruments ( $ 2,301 and $ 1,769 as of December 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018 , respectively). Certain long-term debt (debt tied to derivatives designated as a fair value hedge) is recorded at fair value. All other long-term debt is recorded at amortized cost, but is measured at fair value for disclosure purposes. We consider our debt to be Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. Fair values are generally estimated based on quoted market prices for identical or similar instruments. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. Disclosures about Financial Instruments The notional amounts and fair values of financial instruments used in hedging transactions as of December 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018 are as follows: Notional Amount Fair Value Asset Fair Value (Liability) December 31, 2018 June 30, 2018 December 31, 2018 June 30, 2018 December 31, 2018 June 30, 2018 DERIVATIVES IN FAIR VALUE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Interest rate contracts $ 4,550 $ 4,587 $ 118 $ 125 $ ( 28 ) $ ( 53 ) DERIVATIVES IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Foreign currency interest rate contracts $ 1,855 $ 1,848 $ 21 $ 41 $ ( 59 ) $ ( 75 ) TOTAL DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS $ 6,405 $ 6,435 $ 139 $ 166 $ ( 87 ) $ ( 128 ) DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS Foreign currency contracts $ 7,025 $ 7,358 $ 49 $ 30 $ ( 29 ) $ ( 56 ) TOTAL DERIVATIVES AT FAIR VALUE $ 13,430 $ 13,793 $ 188 $ 196 $ ( 116 ) $ ( 184 ) All derivative assets are presented in Prepaid expenses and other current assets or Other noncurrent assets. All derivative liabilities are presented in Accrued and other liabilities or Other noncurrent liabilities. The fair value of the interest rate derivative asset/liability directly offsets the cumulative amount of the fair value hedging adjustment included in the carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation. The carrying amount of the underlying debt obligation, which includes the unamortized discount or premium and the fair value adjustment, was $ 4,623 and $ 4,639 as of December 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018 , respectively. In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges. The carrying value of those debt instruments designated as net investment hedges, which includes the adjustment for the foreign currency transaction gain or loss on those instruments, was $ 17,092 and $ 15,012 as of December 31, 2018 and June 30, 2018 , respectively. All of the Company's derivative assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. Before tax gains/(losses) on our financial instruments in hedging relationships are categorized as follows: Amount of Gain/(Loss) Recognized in OCI on Derivatives Three Months Ended December 31 Six Months Ended December 31 2018 2017 2018 2017 DERIVATIVES IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS (1) (2) Foreign exchange contracts $ 23 $ ( 89 ) $ 19 $ ( 262 ) (1) For the derivatives in net investment hedging relationships, the amount of gain/(loss) excluded from effectiveness testing, which was recognized in earnings, was $ 13 and $ 42 for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The amount of gain/(loss) excluded from effectiveness testing was $ 27 and $ 73 for the six months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. (2) In addition to the foreign currency derivative contracts designated as net investment hedges, certain of our foreign currency denominated debt instruments are designated as net investment hedges. The amount of gain/(loss) recognized in AOCI for such instruments was $ 228 and $( 176 ) , for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The amount of gain/(loss) recognized in AOCI for such instruments was $ 241 and $( 745 ) , for the six months ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, respectively. Amount of Gain/(Loss) Recognized in Earnings Three Months Ended December 31 Six Months Ended December 31 2018 2017 2018 2017 DERIVATIVES IN FAIR VALUE HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS Interest rate contracts $ 42 $ ( 38 ) $ 18 $ ( 41 ) DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS Foreign currency contracts $ ( 5 ) $ ( 1 ) $ ( 7 ) $ ( 2 ) The gain/(loss) on the derivatives in fair value hedging relationships is fully offset by the mark-to-market impact of the related exposure. These are both recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in Interest Expense. The gain/(loss) on derivatives not designated as hedging instruments is substantially offset by the currency mark-to-market of the related exposure. These are both recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in SG&A. Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. 8. Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss) The table below presents the changes in Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (AOCI), including the reclassifications out of Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) by component: Changes in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income/(Loss) by Component Hedges Investment Securities Pension and Other Retiree Benefits Financial Statement Translation Total AOCI Balance at June 30, 2018 $ ( 3,246 ) $ ( 173 ) $ ( 4,058 ) $ ( 7,272 ) $ ( 14,749 ) OCI before reclassifications (1) 199 54 149 ( 587 ) ( 185 ) Amounts reclassified from AOCI (2) — ( 1 ) 101 1 101 Net current period OCI 199 53 250 ( 586 ) ( 84 ) Reclassification to retained earnings in accordance with ASU 2018-02 (3) ( 18 ) — ( 308 ) — ( 326 ) Less: Other comprehensive income/(loss) attributable to non-controlling interests — — — ( 3 ) ( 3 ) Balance at December 31, 2018 $ ( 3,065 ) $ ( 120 ) $ ( 4,116 ) $ ( 7,855 ) $ ( 15,156 ) (1) Net of tax expense/(benefit) of $ 61 , $ 0 and $ 38 for gains/losses on hedges, investment securities and pension and other retiree benefit items, respectively.

(3) Adjustment made to early adopt ASU 2018-02: ""Reclassification of Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income,"" as discussed in Note 2. The below provides additional details on amounts reclassified from AOCI into the Consolidated Statements of Earnings: • Investment securities: amounts reclassified from AOCI into Other non-operating income, net. • Pension and other retiree benefits: amounts reclassified from AOCI into Other non-operating income, net and included in the computation of net periodic postretirement costs. • Financial statement translation: amounts reclassified from AOCI into SG&A. 9. Restructuring Program The Company has historically incurred an ongoing annual level of restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Before-tax costs incurred under the ongoing program have generally ranged from $ 250 to $ 500 annually. In fiscal 2017, the Company announced specific elements of a multi-year productivity and cost savings plan to further reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, certain marketing activities and overhead expenses. This program is expected to result in incremental enrollment reductions, along with further optimization of the supply chain and other manufacturing processes. Restructuring costs incurred consist primarily of costs to separate employees, asset-related costs to exit facilities and other costs. For the three and six month periods ended December 31, 2018 , the Company incurred total restructuring charges of $ 177 and $ 314 , respectively. Of these charges incurred, $ 25 and $ 97 were recorded in SG&A and $ 143 and $ 207 were recorded in Cost of products sold, respectively. The remainder of these charges were recorded in Other non-operating income, net. The following table presents restructuring activity for the six months ended December 31, 2018: Charges Previously Reported (Three Months Ended September 30, 2018) Charges for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2018 Six Months Ended December 31, 2018 Reserve Balance June 30, 2018 Cash Spent Charges Against Assets Reserve Balance December 31, 2018 Separations $ 259 $ 53 $ 56 $ ( 115 ) $ — $ 253 Asset-related costs — 28 22 — ( 50 ) — Other costs 254 56 99 ( 180 ) — 229 Total $ 513 $ 137 $ 177 $ ( 295 ) $ ( 50 ) $ 482 Separation Costs Employee separation charges for the three and six month periods ended December 31, 2018 relate to severance packages for approximately 500 employees and 970 employees, respectively. The packages were predominantly voluntary and the amounts were calculated based on salary levels and past service periods. Severance costs related to voluntary separations are generally charged to earnings when the employee accepts the offer. Asset-Related Costs Asset-related costs consist of both asset write-downs and accelerated depreciation. Asset write-downs relate to the establishment of a new fair value basis for assets held-for-sale or disposal. These assets were written down to the lower of their current carrying basis or amounts expected to be realized upon disposal, less minor disposal costs. Charges for accelerated depreciation relate to long-lived assets that will be taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period. These assets relate primarily to manufacturing consolidations and technology standardizations. The asset-related charges will not have a significant impact on future depreciation charges. Other Costs Other restructuring-type charges are incurred as a direct result of the restructuring program. Such charges primarily include asset removal and termination of contracts related to supply chain optimization. Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the restructuring program charges are funded by and included within Corporate for both management and segment reporting. Accordingly, all of the charges under the program are included within the Corporate reportable segment. However, for informative purposes, the following table summarizes the total restructuring costs related to our reportable segments: Three Months Ended December 31, 2018 Six Months Ended December 31, 2018 Beauty $ 17 $ 27 Grooming 25 31 Health Care 4 12 Fabric & Home Care 18 31 Baby, Feminine & Family Care 70 91 Corporate (1) 43 122 Total Company $ 177 $ 314 (1) Corporate includes costs related to allocated overheads, including charges related to our Sales and Market Operations, Global Business Services and Corporate Functions activities. 10. Commitments and Contingencies Litigation The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims arising out of our business which cover a wide range of matters such as antitrust, trade and other governmental regulations, product liability, patent and trademark, advertising, contracts, environmental, labor and employment and tax. With respect to these and other litigation and claims, while considerable uncertainty exists, in the opinion of management and our counsel, the ultimate resolution of the various lawsuits and claims will not materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. We are also subject to contingencies pursuant to environmental laws and regulations that in the future may require us to take action to correct the effects on the environment of prior manufacturing and waste disposal practices. Based on currently available information, we do not believe the ultimate resolution of environmental remediation will materially affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Income Tax Uncertainties The Company is present in approximately 150 taxable jurisdictions and, at any point in time, has 40 – 50 jurisdictional audits underway at various stages of completion. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities for uncertain tax positions that may be challenged by local authorities and may not be fully sustained, despite our belief that the underlying tax positions are fully supportable. Uncertain tax positions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, including progress of tax audits, developments in case law and closing of statutes of limitations. Such adjustments are reflected in the tax provision as appropriate. We have tax years open ranging from 2008 and forward. We are generally not able to reliably estimate the ultimate settlement amounts until the close of the audit. While we do not expect material changes, it is possible that the amount of unrecognized benefit with respect to our uncertain tax positions could increase or decrease within the next 12 months. At this time, we are not able to make a reasonable estimate of the range of impact on the balance of uncertain tax positions or the impact on the effective tax rate related to these items. Additional information on the Commitments and Contingencies of the Company can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2018 . Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. 11. Merck Acquisition On November 30, 2018, we completed our acquisition of the over the counter (OTC) healthcare business of Merck KGaA (Merck OTC) for $ 3.7 billion (based on exchange rates at the time of closing) in an all-cash transaction. This business primarily sells OTC consumer healthcare products, mainly in Europe, Latin America and Asia markets. The results of Merck OTC, which are not material to the Company, are reported in our consolidated financial statements beginning December 1, 2018. Total sales for Merck OTC’s most recently completed fiscal year ended December 31, 2017 were approximately $ 1 billion . The following table presents the preliminary allocation of purchase price related to the Merck OTC business as of the date of acquisition. The preliminary allocation of the purchase price is based on the best estimates of management and is subject to revision based on final determination of fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired, which will be completed as we complete our analysis of the underlying assets and acquired liabilities, such as pensions, litigation cases, environmental issues, and tax positions. Amounts in Millions November 30, 2018 Current assets $ 393 Property, plant and equipment 122 Intangible assets 2,111 Goodwill 2,010 Other non-current assets 143 Total Assets Acquired $ 4,779 Current liabilities $ 233 Deferred income taxes 661 Non-current liabilities 60 Total Liabilities Acquired $ 954 Noncontrolling Interest (1) $ 169 Net Assets Acquired $ 3,656 (1) Represents a 48 % minority ownership interest in the Merck India company. The acquisition resulted in $ 2.0 billion in goodwill, of which approximately $ 180 million is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. All of this goodwill was allocated to the Health Care Segment. The goodwill is primarily attributable to the assembled workforce and synergies we expect to generate by combining the Merck OTC business with the Company’s existing personal health care business. We have preliminarily estimated the fair value of Merck OTC’s identifiable intangible assets as $ 2.1 billion . The preliminary allocation of identifiable intangible assets and their average useful lives is as follows: Amounts in Millions Estimated Fair Value Avg Remaining Useful Life Intangible Assets with Determinable Lives Brands $ 701 14 Patents and technology 118 7 Customer relationships 346 20 Total $ 1,165 15 Intangible Assets with Indefinite Lives Brands 946 Total Intangible Assets $ 2,111 Amounts in millions of dollars unless otherwise specified. The majority of the intangible valuation relates to brand intangibles. Our preliminary assessment as to brand intangibles that have an indefinite life and those that have a definite life was based on a number of factors, including competitive environment, market share, brand history, product life cycles, operating plan and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. The indefinite-lived brand intangibles include Neurobion and Dolo Neurobion. The definite-lived brand intangibles primarily include regional or local brands. The definite-lived brand intangibles have estimated lives ranging from 10 to 20 years. The technology intangibles are related to R&D and manufacturing know-how; these intangibles have a 7 year estimated life. The customer relationships intangibles have a 20 year estimated life and reflect the historical and projected attrition rates for Merck OTC’s relationships with health care professionals, retailers and distributors.

A detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results and events to differ materially from those projected herein, is included in the section titled “Economic Conditions and Uncertainties” and the section titled “Risk Factors” (Part II, Item 1A) of this Form 10-Q. The purpose of Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) is to provide an understanding of Procter & Gamble's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows by focusing on changes in certain key measures from year to year. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. The MD&A is organized in the following sections: • Overview • Summary of Results – Six Months Ended December 31, 2018 • Economic Conditions and Uncertainties • Results of Operations – Three and Six Months Ended December 31, 2018 • Business Segment Discussion – Three and Six Months Ended December 31, 2018 • Liquidity and Capital Resources • Reconciliation of Measures Not Defined by U.S. GAAP Throughout the MD&A, we refer to measures used by management to evaluate performance, including unit volume growth, net sales and net earnings. We also refer to a number of financial measures that are not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), including organic sales growth, core net earnings per share (Core EPS), adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity. The explanation at the end of the MD&A provides the definition of these non-GAAP measures as well as details on the use and the derivation of these measures. Management also uses certain market share and market consumption estimates to evaluate performance relative to competition despite some limitations on the availability and comparability of share and consumption information. References to market share and market consumption in the MD&A are based on a combination of vendor purchased traditional brick-and-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales in dollar terms on a constant currency basis of our products, relative to all product sales in the category. The Company measures fiscal-year-to-date market shares through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months. OVERVIEW P&G is a global leader in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world. Our products are sold in more than 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, baby stores, specialty beauty stores, high-frequency stores and pharmacies. We have on-the-ground operations in approximately 70 countries. Our market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors. In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position. The table below provides detail on our reportable segments, including the product categories and brand composition within each segment.

The following table provides the percentage of net sales and net earnings by reportable business segment for the three and six months ended December 31, 2018 (excluding net sales and net earnings in Corporate): Three Months Ended December 31, 2018 Six Months Ended December 31, 2018 Net Sales Net Earnings Net Sales Net Earnings Beauty 20% 24% 20% 25% Grooming 9% 12% 9% 11% Health Care 13% 16% 12% 14% Fabric & Home Care 32% 26% 33% 28% Baby, Feminine & Family Care 26% 22% 26% 22% Total Company 100% 100% 100% 100% SUMMARY OF RESULTS Following are highlights of results for the six months ended December 31, 2018 versus the six months ended December 31, 2017 : • Net sales were unchanged at $34.1 billion . Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and foreign exchange, increased 4% . Organic sales increased 8% in Beauty, 5% in Health Care and Fabric & Home Care and 1% in Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Organic sales were unchanged in Grooming. • Unit volume increased 2% , with organic volume up 3% . Volume increased mid-single digits in Fabric & Home Care, low single digits in Beauty, Health Care and Baby, Feminine & Family Care and was unchanged in Grooming. Excluding the impacts of the PGT Healthcare partnership dissolution and the Merck OTC acquisition, organic volume increased mid-single digits in Health Care. • Net earnings were $6.4 billion , an increase of $996 million, or 18% versus the prior year due to a reduction in current year income tax expense (due primarily to the ongoing impacts of the U.S. Tax Act), a current year gain on the dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership and base period charges related to the transitional impacts of the U.S. Tax Act. • Diluted net earnings per share increased 22% to $2.44 due primarily to the increase in net earnings and a reduction in shares outstanding due to share repurchases. • Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $1.0 billion or 20% versus the prior year period to $6.4 billion . • Core net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble, which represents net earnings excluding the current period gain on the dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership, incremental restructuring charges in both periods and the base period charges related to the transitional impacts of the U.S. Tax Act, increased 1% to $6.2 billion. Core net earnings per share increased 4% to $2.36 due to the increase in Core net earnings and the reduction in shares outstanding. • Operating cash flow was $7.6 billion . Adjusted free cash flow, which is operating cash flow less capital expenditures and certain other impacts, was $6.0 billion . Adjusted free cash flow productivity was 99% . Adjusted free cash flow and adjusted free cash flow productivity are defined in the section entitled ""Reconciliation of Measures not defined by U.S. GAAP."" ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND UNCERTAINTIES Global Economic Conditions . Our products are sold in countries around the world including North America, Europe, Latin America, Asia and Africa with more than half our sales generated outside the United States. As such, we are exposed to and impacted by global macro-economic factors, U.S. and foreign government policies and foreign exchange fluctuations. Current macroeconomic factors remain dynamic, and any causes of market size contraction, such as reduced GDP in commodity-dependent economies, greater political unrest in the Middle East, Central & Eastern Europe and the Korean peninsula, economic uncertainty related to the execution of the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, political instability in certain Latin American markets and overall economic slowdowns, could reduce our sales or erode our operating margin, in either case reducing our earnings. Changes in Costs . Our costs are subject to fluctuations, particularly due to changes in commodity prices, transportation costs and our own productivity efforts. We have significant exposures to certain commodities, in particular certain oil-derived materials like resins and paper-based materials like pulp, and volatility in the market price of these commodity input materials has a direct impact on our costs. If we are unable to manage commodity fluctuations through pricing actions, cost savings projects and sourcing decisions, as well as through consistent productivity improvements, it may adversely impact our gross margin, operating margin and net earnings. Sales could also be adversely impacted following pricing actions if there is a negative impact on consumption of our products. We strive to implement, achieve and sustain cost improvement plans, including outsourcing projects, supply chain optimization and general overhead and workforce optimization. As discussed later in this MD&A, in 2012 we initiated overhead and supply chain cost improvement projects. In fiscal 2017, we communicated specific elements of an additional multi-year cost reduction program which is resulting in enrollment reductions and other savings. If we are not successful in executing and sustaining these changes, there could be a negative impact on our operating margin and net earnings. Foreign Exchange . We have both translation and transaction exposure to the fluctuation of exchange rates. Translation exposures relate to exchange rate impacts of measuring income statements of foreign subsidiaries that do not use the U.S. dollar as their functional currency. Transaction exposures relate to 1) the impact from input costs that are denominated in a currency other than the local reporting currency and 2) the revaluation of transaction-related working capital balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency. In four of the past five fiscal years, as well as the current year, the U.S. dollar has strengthened versus a number of foreign currencies leading to lower sales and earnings from these foreign exchange impacts. Certain countries experiencing significant exchange rate fluctuations, like Argentina, Russia, Turkey, Brazil, China and the United Kingdom have previously had, and could in the future have, a significant impact on our sales, costs and earnings. Increased pricing in response to certain fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may offset portions of the currency impacts but could also have a negative impact on consumption of our products, which would affect our sales and profits. Government Policies . Our net earnings could be affected by changes in U.S. or foreign government tax policies, for example, the U.S. Tax Act enacted in December 2017, the implications and uncertainties of which are disclosed elsewhere in this report. Additionally, we attempt to carefully manage our debt, currency and other exposures in certain countries with currency exchange, import authorization and pricing controls, such as Nigeria, Algeria and Egypt. Further, our earnings and sales could be affected by changes to international trade agreements in North America and elsewhere, including increases of import tariffs, both currently effective and future potential changes. Changes in government policies in these areas might cause an increase or decrease in our sales, operating margin and net earnings. For information on risk factors that could impact our results, please refer to “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2018. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Three Months Ended December 31, 2018 The following discussion provides a review of results for the three months ended December 31, 2018 versus the three months ended December 31, 2017 . Three Months Ended December 31 Amounts in millions, except per share amounts 2018 2017 % Chg Net sales $17,438 $17,395 —% Operating income 3,896 3,919 (1)% Net earnings 3,216 2,561 26% Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 3,194 2,495 28% Diluted net earnings per common share 1.22 0.93 31% Core net earnings per common share 1.25 1.19 5% Three Months Ended December 31 COMPARISONS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES 2018 2017 Basis Pt Chg Gross profit 48.9% 49.9% (100) Selling, general & administrative expense 26.5% 27.4% (90) Operating income 22.3% 22.5% (20) Earnings before income taxes 22.5% 23.2% (70) Net earnings 18.4% 14.7% 370 Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 18.3% 14.3% 400 Net Sales Net sales for the quarter were unchanged versus the previous period at $17.4 billion including a 4% negative impact from foreign exchange. Unit volume increased 2% . Pricing was a 1% favorable impact to net sales. Mix was a 1% positive impact to net sales, driven by disproportionate growth of the premium Skin Care category (behind the SK-II brand) and developed regions, all of which have higher than company average selling prices. Volume increased mid-single digits in Fabric & Home Care and increased low single digits in Beauty, Health Care and Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Volume decreased mid-single digits in Grooming. Excluding the impacts of the PGT Healthcare partnership dissolution and Merck OTC acquisition, Health Care organic volume increased mid-single digits. Excluding the impact of minor acquisitions and divestitures, Beauty organic volume was unchanged. Volume increased low single digits in developed regions and was unchanged in developing regions. Excluding the impact of minor brand divestitures, organic volume in developing regions increased low single digits. Organic sales increased 4% on a 2% increase in organic volume.

(2) Other includes the sales mix impact from acquisitions and divestitures, the impact from the July 1, 2018 adoption of new accounting standards for ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers"" and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile volume to net sales. Operating Costs Gross margin decreased 100 basis points to 48.9% of net sales for the quarter. Gross margin benefited from 150 basis points of gross manufacturing cost savings projects (120 basis points net of product and packaging reinvestments) and 50 basis points of positive pricing impacts. This was offset by: • a 90 basis point decline due to higher commodity costs, • a 120 basis point decline from unfavorable product mix (primarily within segments due to the growth of lower margin products forms in certain categories and due to the disproportionate growth of the Fabric Care category which has lower than company-average margins) and other impacts and • a 60 basis point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange Total SG&A spending decreased 3% to $4.6 billion due to decreases in marketing spending costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 90 basis points to 26.5% . Reductions in marketing spending as a percentage of net sales were partially offset by an increase in overhead costs as a percentage of net sales. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 130 basis points due to the positive scale impacts of the organic net sales increase, savings in agency compensation, production costs and advertising spending, and the impact of adopting the new standard on ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers"" which prospectively reclassified certain customer spending from marketing (SG&A) expense to a reduction of net sales. Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales increased 30 basis points as the fixed cost leverage of increased volume and productivity savings were more than offset by inflation, Merck OTC transition related spending and other costs. Other net operating costs as a percentage of net sales increased 10 basis points. Productivity-driven cost savings delivered 60 basis points of benefit in SG&A. Non-Operating Expenses and Income Interest expense was $138 million for the quarter, an increase of $16 million versus the prior year period due to an increase in debt and in weighted average interest rates. Interest income was $63 million for the quarter, a marginal decrease versus the prior year period. Other non-operating income was $95 million , a decrease of $75 million versus the prior year period primarily due to the impact of minor brand divestiture gains in the base period. Income Taxes For the three months ended December 31, 2018 the effective tax rate decreased 1,860 basis points versus the prior year period to 17.9% due to: • a 1,550 basis-point reduction due to prior year transitional impacts from the U.S. Tax Act, • a 410 basis-point reduction from the on-going impacts of U.S. Tax reform. The lower blended U.S. federal tax rate on current year earnings was partially offset by the impact of recording a year-to-date (6 month) impact in December 2017 upon passage of the tax reform. • a 150 basis-point reduction from excess tax benefits from share-based compensation (170 basis points in the current year versus 20 basis points in the prior year), • a 90 basis-point reduction from discrete impacts related to uncertain tax positions (90 basis points in the current year versus 0 basis points in the prior year), • a 340 basis-point increase from unfavorable impacts from geographic mix of earnings. Net Earnings Net earnings increased $655 million or 26% to $3.2 billion for the quarter . The tax rate reduction discussed above drove a $772 million increase in net earnings. This tax benefit and the decrease in SG&A spending were partially offset by the decrease in gross margin, all of which are discussed above. Foreign exchange had a negative impact of $229 million on net earnings for the quarter, including both transactional charges and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars. Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $699 million or 28% to $3.2 billion for the quarter. Diluted net earnings per share increased 31% to $1.22 . The difference between the change in net earnings and diluted net earnings per share was due to a reduction in the number of shares outstanding. Core net earnings per share increased 5% to $1.25 . Core net earnings per share represents diluted net earnings per share excluding the transitional impacts from the U.S. Tax Act in the base period and incremental restructuring charges in both periods related to our productivity and cost savings plans. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS – Six Months Ended December 31, 2018 The following discussion provides a review of results for the six months ended December 31, 2018 versus the six months ended December 31, 2017 . Six Months Ended December 31 Amounts in millions, except per share amounts 2018 2017 % Chg Net sales $34,128 $34,048 —% Operating income 7,450 7,567 (2)% Net earnings 6,427 5,431 18% Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 6,393 5,348 20% Diluted net earnings per common share 2.44 2.00 22% Core net earnings per common share $2.36 $2.28 4% Six Months Ended December 31 COMPARISONS AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES 2018 2017 Basis Pt Chg Gross profit 49.0% 50.1% (110) Selling, general & administrative expense 27.2% 27.9% (70) Operating income 21.8% 22.2% (40) Earnings before income taxes 23.0% 22.9% 10 Net earnings 18.8% 16.0% 280 Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble 18.7% 15.7% 300 Net Sales Net sales for the six months ended December 31, 2018 were unchanged at $34.1 billion including a 3% negative impact from foreign exchange. Unit volume increased 2% . Mix was a 1% positive impact to net sales, driven by disproportionate organic growth of the Skin and Personal Care and Personal Health Care categories and developed regions, all of which have higher than company average selling prices. Volume increased mid-single digits in Fabric & Home Care and increased low single digits in Beauty, Health Care and Baby, Feminine & Family Care. Volume was unchanged in Grooming. Excluding the impacts of the PGT Healthcare partnership dissolution and Merck OTC acquisition, Health Care organic volume increased mid-single digits. Volume increased mid-single digits in developed regions and low single digits in developing regions. Organic sales increased 4% on a 3% increase in organic volume.

(2) Other includes the sales mix impact from acquisitions and divestitures, the impact from the July 1, 2018 adoption of new accounting standards for ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers"" and rounding impacts necessary to reconcile volume to net sales. Operating Costs Gross margin decreased 110 basis points to 49.0% of net sales for the six months ended December 31, 2018 . Gross margin benefited from 130 basis points of gross manufacturing cost savings projects (100 basis points net of product and packaging reinvestments) and 20 basis points of positive pricing impacts. This was offset by: • a 100 basis point decline due to higher commodity costs, • a 70 basis point decline from unfavorable product mix (primarily within segments due to the growth of lower margin products forms and club channels in certain categories and due to the disproportionate growth of the Fabric Care category which has lower than company-average margins) and other impacts and • a 60 basis point decline from unfavorable foreign exchange Total SG&A spending decreased 2% to $9.3 billion primarily due to decreases in marketing spending costs. SG&A as a percentage of net sales decreased 70 basis points to 27.2% . Reduction in marketing spending as a percentage of net sales was partially offset by an increase in other net operating costs as a percentage of net sales. Overhead costs as a percentage of net sales was unchanged as productivity savings and fixed cost leverage of increased volume, were offset by an increase in inflation and other costs. Marketing spending as a percentage of net sales decreased 110 basis points due to the positive scale impacts of the organic net sales increase, savings in agency compensation, production costs and advertising spending, and the impact of adopting the new standard on ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers"" which prospectively reclassified certain customer spending from marketing (SG&A) expense to a reduction of net sales. Other net operating costs as a percentage of net sales increased approximately 50 basis points primarily due to an increase in foreign exchange transactional charges. Productivity-driven cost savings delivered 70 basis points of benefit in SG&A. Non-Operating Expenses and Income Interest expense was $267 million for the six months ended December 31, 2018 , an increase of $30 million versus the prior year period due to an increase in debt and in weighted average interest rates. Interest income was $116 million for the six months ended December 31, 2018 , a marginal increase versus the prior year period. Other non-operating income was $557 million , an increase of $218 million versus the prior year period primarily due to the $355 million before-tax gain from the dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership, partially offset by the impact of minor brand divestiture gains in the base period. Income Taxes For the six months ended December 31, 2018 the effective tax rate decreased 1,200 basis points versus the prior year period to 18.2% due to: • an 810 basis-point reduction due to prior year transitional impacts from the U.S. Tax Act, • a 490 basis-point reduction from the impact of the lower blended U.S. federal tax rate on current year earnings versus the prior year rate, • an 80 basis-point reduction from the tax impact of the gain on the dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership, • a 40 basis-point reduction from excess tax benefits from share-based compensation (110 basis points in the current year versus 70 basis points in the prior year), • a 20 basis-point reduction from discrete impacts related to uncertain tax positions (20 basis points in the current year versus 0 basis points in the prior year), • a 240 basis-point increase from unfavorable impacts from geographic mix of earnings. Net Earnings Net earnings increased $996 million or 18% to $6.4 billion for the fiscal year to date period. The tax rate reduction discussed above drove a $924 million increase in net earnings. This tax benefit along with the current period gain on the dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership and decrease in SG&A spending were partially offset by the decrease in gross margin, all of which are discussed above. Foreign exchange had a $484 million negative impact on net earnings for the fiscal year to date period, including both transactional charges and translational impacts from converting earnings from foreign subsidiaries to U.S. dollars. Net earnings attributable to Procter & Gamble increased $1 billion or 20% to $6.4 billion. Diluted net earnings per share increased 22% to $2.44 . The difference between the change in net earnings and diluted net earnings per share was due to a reduction in the number of shares outstanding. Core net earnings per share increased 4% to $2.36 . Core net earnings per share represents diluted net earnings per share excluding the current period gain on the dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership, incremental restructuring charges in both periods related to our productivity and cost savings plans and the base period charges related to the transitional impacts of the U.S. Tax Act.

Net earnings increased 18% to $772 million due to the increase in net sales and a 280 basis-point increase in net earnings margin. The net earnings margin increased due to a decrease in SG&A as a percentage of net sales, an increase in gross margin and a reduction in U.S. income tax rates resulting from the U.S. Tax Act. The gross margin increase was primarily driven by manufacturing cost savings and the benefit of increased pricing. The reduction in SG&A as a percentage of sales was primarily driven by the positive scale impacts of the net sales increase and the impacts of adopting the new accounting standard on ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers.""

Corporate Corporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities not allocated to specific business segments. These include: the incidental businesses managed at the corporate level; financing and investing activities; certain employee benefit costs; other general corporate items; the gains and losses related to certain divested brands and categories; certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and workforce optimization. Corporate also includes reconciling items to adjust the accounting policies used in the segments to U.S. GAAP. The most significant reconciling item includes income taxes to adjust from blended statutory rates that are reflected in the segments to the overall Company effective tax rate. Corporate net sales increased $2 million to $ 129 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2018 and increased $10 million to $245 million for the fiscal year to date. Corporate net earnings increased $262 million in the quarter primarily due to a reduction in income tax expense of $446 million, partially offset by the impact of minor brand divestiture gains in the base period and higher unallocated SG&A costs in the current year. The reduction in income tax expense was driven by the base period charges for the transitional impacts of the U.S. Tax Act, partially offset by the impact of the allocation methodology of the lower U.S. tax rates (in the prior year the net benefit was held in Corporate, whereas the lower rates are included in the reporting segments in the current year). Fiscal year to date Corporate net earnings increased $268 million due to a $270 million reduction in income tax expense (driven by the same factors impacting the quarter ended December 31, 2018) and higher current year divestiture gains (driven by the current year gain on the dissolution of the PGT healthcare partnership), partially offset by higher current year foreign exchange transactional charges (discussed earlier in the Results of Operations section) and higher unallocated SG&A costs in the current year. Restructuring Program to deliver Productivity and Cost Savings In 2012, the Company initiated a productivity and cost savings plan to reduce costs and better leverage scale in the areas of supply chain, research and development, marketing and overheads. The plan was designed to accelerate cost reductions by streamlining management decision making, manufacturing and other work processes to fund the Company's growth strategy. In 2017, the Company communicated specific elements of an additional multi-year productivity and cost savings program. The current productivity and cost savings plan will further reduce costs in the areas of supply chain, certain marketing activities and overhead expenses. As part of this plan, the Company incurred $1.1 billion in total before-tax restructuring costs in fiscal 2018, with an additional amount of approximately $0.8 billion expected in fiscal 2019. This program is expected to result in additional enrollment reductions, along with further optimization of the supply chain and other manufacturing processes. Consistent with our historical policies for ongoing restructuring-type activities, the resulting charges are funded by and included within Corporate for segment reporting. In addition to our restructuring programs, we have additional ongoing savings efforts in our supply chain, marketing and overhead areas that yield additional benefits to our operating margins. Refer to Note 9 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for more details on the restructuring program. LIQUIDITY & CAPITAL RESOURCES Operating Activities We generated $7.6 billion of cash from operating activities fiscal year to date, an increase of approximately $0.3 billion versus the prior year. Net earnings, adjusted for non-cash items (depreciation and amortization, share-based compensation expense, deferred income taxes, and gain on sale of assets), generated $7.6 billion of operating cash flow. Working capital and other impacts had no net impact on operating cash flow in the period. Accounts receivable increased, using $398 million of cash due to sales growth and to a lesser extent, the timing of collections at quarter-end due to the holidays. Inventory consumed $531 million of cash primarily due to product initiatives and business growth. Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities increased, generating $1.1 billion of cash primarily driven by an increase in payables to support the increase in inventory, increased marketing accruals based on timing of spending and extended payment terms with our suppliers. All other operating assets and liabilities used $370 million of cash, driven primarily by payments of the current year portion of taxes due related to the U.S. Tax Act. Investing Activities Cash used by investing activities was $4.7 billion fiscal year to date. Capital expenditures were $1.8 billion , or 5.2% of net sales. Acquisition activity used $3.8 billion of cash, primarily related to the Merck OTC acquisition. We used $158 million for purchases of short-term investments. These uses were partially offset by $1.1 billion of cash generated from sales and maturities of short-term investments. Financing Activities Our financing activities consumed net cash of $1.6 billion fiscal year to date. We used $2.0 billion for treasury stock purchases and $3.7 billion for dividends. Cash generated from the net effect of debt issuances and payments was $2.6 billion . Cash from the exercise of stock options and other impacts generated $1.5 billion of cash. As of December 31, 2018 , our current liabilities exceeded current assets by $6.8 billion . We have short- and long-term debt to meet our financing needs. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs largely through cash generated from operations. We have strong short- and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in commercial paper and bond markets. In addition, we have agreements with a diverse group of financial institutions that, if needed, should provide sufficient credit funding to meet short-term financing requirements. RECONCILIATION OF MEASURES NOT DEFINED BY U.S. GAAP In accordance with the SEC's Regulation G, the following provides definitions of the non-GAAP measures and the reconciliation to the most closely related GAAP measures. We believe that these measures provide useful perspective on underlying business results and trends (i.e., trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and provide a supplemental measure of year-on-year results. The non-GAAP measures described below are used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of management. These measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measure, but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted. Organic sales growth : Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures, the impact from the July 1, 2018 adoption of new accounting standards for ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers"" and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. The impact of the adoption of the new accounting standard for Revenue from Contracts with Customers is driven by the prospective reclassification of certain customer spending from marketing (SG&A) expense to a reduction of Net sales. We believe this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. This measure is used in assessing achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. Adjusted free cash flow : Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the comprehensive U.S. legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017 (the U.S. Tax Act). Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. Management views adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments. Adjusted free cash flow productivity : Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings excluding the gain on dissolution of the PGT Healthcare partnership, which is non-recurring and not considered indicative of underlying cash flow performance. Management views adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G’s ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. This measure is also used in assessing the achievement of management goals for at-risk compensation. The Company's long-term target is to generate annual adjusted free cash flow productivity at or above 90 percent. Core EPS : Core earnings per share, or Core EPS, is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share adjusted as indicated. Management views this non-GAAP measure as a useful supplemental measure of Company performance over time. This measure is also used when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation. The Core earnings measures included in the following reconciliation tables refer to the equivalent GAAP measures adjusted as applicable for the following items: Incremental Restructuring : The Company has had and continues to have an ongoing level of restructuring activities. Such activities have resulted in ongoing annual restructuring related charges of approximately $250 - $500 million before tax. In 2012, the Company began a $10 billion strategic productivity and cost savings initiative that included incremental restructuring activities. In 2017, we communicated details of an additional multi-year productivity and cost savings plan. This results in incremental restructuring charges to accelerate productivity efforts and cost savings. The adjustment to Core earnings includes only the restructuring costs above what we believe are the normal recurring level of restructuring costs. Transitional Impact of U.S. Tax Reform : As discussed in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”) in December 2017. This resulted in a net charge of $628 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, comprised of an estimated repatriation tax charge of $3.8 billion and a net deferred tax benefit of $3.2 billion. The adjustment to core earnings only includes this transitional impact. It does not include the ongoing impacts of the lower U.S. statutory rate on current year earnings. Gain on Dissolution of PGT Healthcare Partnership: The Company finalized the dissolution of our PGT Healthcare partnership, a venture between the Company and Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries, Ltd. (Teva) in the OTC consumer healthcare business, in the quarter ended September 30, 2018. The transaction was accounted for as a sale of the Teva portion of the PGT business; the Company recognized an after-tax gain on the dissolution of $353 million. We do not view the above items to be part of our sustainable results and their exclusion from Core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results. These items are also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation.
