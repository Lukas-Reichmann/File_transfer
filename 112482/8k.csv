As we enter a new fiscal year, I am confident in our ability to deliver against a backdrop of geopolitical and economic uncertainty. There is tremendous opportunity ahead and I am as optimistic as ever about Visa’s role in the future of payments.""

Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2023 — Financial Highlights GAAP net income in the fiscal fourth quarter was $4.7 billion or $2.27 per share, an increase of 19% and 22%, respectively, over prior year’s results. Current year’s results included a special item of $109 million for a litigation provision associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation (""MDL"") case, $7 million of net gains from equity investments and $67 million from the amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related costs. Prior year’s results included $122 million of net losses from equity investments and $68 million from the amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related costs. Excluding these items from the current and prior year and related tax impacts, non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $4.8 billion or $2.33 per share, increases of 18% and 21%, respectively, over prior year’s results (refer to the accompanying financial tables for further details and a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures presented). GAAP earnings per share growth was approximately 22% on a constant-dollar basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar. Non-GAAP earnings per share growth was approximately 21% on a constant-dollar basis. All references to earnings per share assume fully-diluted class A share count. Net revenues in the fiscal fourth quarter were $8.6 billion, an increase of 11%, driven by the year-over-year growth in payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions. Net revenues increased 10% on a constant-dollar basis. Payments volume for the three months ended June 30, 2023, on which fiscal fourth quarter service revenues are recognized, increased 9% over the prior year on a constant-dollar basis. Payments volume for the three months ended September 30, 2023 increased 9% over the prior year on a constant-dollar basis. Cross-border volume excluding transactions within Europe, which drives our international transaction revenues, increased 18% on a constant-dollar basis for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Total cross-border volume on a constant-dollar basis increased 16% in the quarter. Total processed transactions, which represent transactions processed by Visa, for the three months ended September 30, 2023, were 56.0 billion, a 10% increase over the prior year. Fiscal fourth quarter service revenues were $3.9 billion, an increase of 12% over the prior year, and are recognized based on payments volume in the prior quarter. All other revenue categories are recognized based on current quarter activity. Data processing revenues rose 13% over the prior year to $4.3 billion. International transaction revenues grew 10% over the prior year to $3.2 billion. Other revenues of $744 million rose 35% over the prior year. Client incentives were $3.4 billion, up 20% over the prior year. GAAP operating expenses were $3.1 billion for the fiscal fourth quarter, a 13% increase over the prior year's results, primarily driven by increases in personnel expenses and the litigation provision. GAAP operating expenses included the litigation provision in the current year and the amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related costs in the current and prior year. Excluding these operating expense items, non-GAAP operating expenses increased 9% over the prior year, primarily driven by increases in personnel and general and administrative expenses. GAAP non-operating income was $86 million for the fiscal fourth quarter, including $7 million of net gains from equity investments. Excluding this item, non-GAAP non-operating income was $79 million. GAAP effective income tax rate was 16.9% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, including the tax impacts from the non-GAAP items. Excluding these items, the non-GAAP effective income tax rate was 17.0% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates had a tax benefit related to the extension of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations. Cash, cash equivalents and investment securities were $22.0 billion at September 30, 2023. The weighted-average number of diluted shares of class A common stock outstanding was 2.07 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. 2 Fiscal Full-Year 2023 — Financial Highlights (1) GAAP net income in the fiscal full-year 2023 was $17.3 billion or $8.28 per share, an increase of 15% and 18%, respectively, over prior year’s results. Current year’s results included a special item of $906 million for a litigation provision associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation (""MDL"") case, $104 million of net losses from equity investments and $266 million from the amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related costs. Prior year’s results included a special item of $861 million for a litigation provision associated with the interchange MDL case, $264 million of net losses from equity investments, $189 million from the amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related costs, and $60 million from the Russia-Ukraine charges. Excluding these items from the current and prior year and related tax impacts, non-GAAP net income for the year was $18.3 billion or $8.77 per share, increases of 14% and 17%, respectively, over prior year’s results (refer to the accompanying financial tables for further details and a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures presented). GAAP earnings per share growth was approximately 21% on a constant-dollar basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar. Non-GAAP earnings per share growth was approximately 19% on a constant-dollar basis. All references to earnings per share assume fully-diluted class A share count. Net revenues in the fiscal full-year 2023 were $32.7 billion, an increase of 11%, driven by the year-over-year growth in payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions. Net revenues increased 13% on a constant-dollar basis. Payments volume for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 increased 9% over the prior year on a constant-dollar basis. Cross-border volume excluding transactions within Europe, which drives our international transaction revenues, increased 25% on a constant-dollar basis for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023. Total cross-border volume on a constant-dollar basis increased 20% for the fiscal year. Total processed transactions, which represent transactions processed by Visa, for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, were 212.6 billion, a 10% increase over the prior year. Fiscal full-year 2023 service revenues were $14.8 billion, an increase of 11% over the prior year. Data processing revenues rose 11% over the prior year to $16.0 billion. International transaction revenues grew 19% over the prior year to $11.6 billion. Other revenues of $2.5 billion rose 24% over the prior year. Client incentives were $12.3 billion, up 19% over the prior year. GAAP operating expenses were $11.7 billion for the fiscal full-year 2023, an 11% increase over the prior year's results, primarily driven by increases in personnel expenses. GAAP operating expenses included the special item related to the litigation provision associated with the MDL case and the amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related costs in the current and prior year and the Russia-Ukraine charges in the prior year. Excluding these operating expense items, non-GAAP operating expenses increased 12% over the prior year, primarily driven by an increase in personnel expenses. GAAP non-operating income was $37 million for the fiscal full-year 2023, including $104 million of net equity investment losses. Excluding this item, non-GAAP non-operating income was $141 million. GAAP effective income tax rate was 17.9% for the fiscal full-year 2023, including the tax impacts from the non-GAAP items. Excluding these items, the non-GAAP effective income tax rate was 18.1% for the fiscal full-year ended September 30, 2023. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates had a tax benefit due to the reassessment of an uncertain tax position related to prior years as a result of new information obtained during an ongoing tax examination and a tax benefit related to the extension of the U.S. foreign tax credit regulations. The weighted-average number of diluted shares of class A common stock outstanding was 2.09 billion for the fiscal full-year ended September 30, 2023. (1) As previously disclosed, in March 2022, we suspended our operations in Russia and therefore our financial highlights from April 2022 through September 2023 do not include Russia-related results. 3 Other Notable Items On September 13, 2023, Visa announced that it is engaging with its common stockholders on the subject of potential amendments to its Seventh Restated Certificate of Incorporation that would authorize Visa to conduct an exchange offer program that would have the effect of releasing transfer restrictions on portions of Visa's class B common stock in a manner that is designed to be economically equivalent to existing arrangements with respect to class A and class C common stockholders' exposure to certain litigation. On September 28, 2023, Visa deposited $150 million into its litigation escrow account, which was previously established under the Company's U.S. retrospective responsibility plan to insulate the Company and class A shareholders from financial liability for certain litigation cases. This deposit has the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Company's class A common stock as it reduces the as-converted class B common stock share count at a volume weighted average price of $231.05. During th e three months ended September 30, 2023, Visa repurchased 17.0 million shares of class A common stock at an average cost of $241.03 per share for $4.1 billion. In the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, Visa repurchased a total of 55.4 million shares of class A common stock at an average cost of $222.98 per share for $12.4 billion. The Company had $4.7 billion of remaining authorized funds for share repurchase as of September 30, 2023. In October, the board of directors authorized a new $25.0 billion multi-year class A common stock share repurchase program. The board of directors also declared an increase to Visa's quarterly cash dividend to $0.520 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and series A, B and C convertible participating preferred stock on an as-converted basis) payable on December 1, 2023, to all holders of record as of November 9, 2023. 4 Financial Outlook for Fiscal Full-Year 2024 Our non-GAAP and adjusted constant-dollar fiscal full-year financial outlook excludes certain items that we believe are not representative of our continuing operations, as they may be non-recurring or have no cash impact, and may distort our longer-term operating trends. We believe presenting these metrics provides investors and management with additional insight into our expected operating performance for fiscal full-year 2024. Growth rates compare our GAAP, non-GAAP and adjusted constant-dollar fiscal full-year 2024 outlook against our GAAP, non-GAAP and adjusted constant-dollar fiscal full-year 2023 financial results, respectively. Please refer to the footnotes in the table immediately below and the Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Results for more information. Such financial measures should not be relied upon as substitutes for, or considered in isolation from, measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Annual Net Revenues Growth (1) Annual Operating Expense Growth Annual Diluted Class A Common Stock Earnings Per Share Growth GAAP Nominal-Dollar Basis High single-digit to low double-digit Approximately flat High-teens Non-GAAP Adjustments (2) N/A ~9% (~5.5%) Non-GAAP Nominal-Dollar Basis High single-digit to low double-digit High single-digit Low-teens Foreign Currency Impact (3) ~1% ~1.5% ~0.5% Acquisition Impact (4) —% —% —% Adjusted Constant-Dollar Basis (5) Low double-digit High single-digit to low double-digit Low-teens (1) There were no non-GAAP adjustments made to net revenues in our fiscal full-year 2024 financial outlook and fiscal full-year 2023 financial results. (2) Our non-GAAP fiscal full-year 2024 financial outlook for annual operating expense growth and annual diluted Class A common stock earnings per share growth reflect adjustments for the amortization of acquired intangible assets of approximately $150 million and $0.06, respectively, and acquisition-related costs of approximately $80 million and $0.03, respectively. No other 2024 non-GAAP adjustments have been made. (3) Our results are denominated in U.S. dollars and are calculated each quarter by applying an established U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rate for each local currency. To eliminate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar in measuring financial performance, we report year-over-year growth using a fixed current year U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rate for the current and prior year periods (""constant-dollar basis""). (4) We exclude the impact of operating revenues and expenses of acquired entities that were not reflected in the full quarter of the prior year following the close of the acquisition. (5) We exclude from our non-GAAP fiscal full-year 2024 financial outlook the (i) impact of foreign currency to provide currency-neutral growth rates as described in (3) and (ii) the impact of acquisitions as described in (4) to arrive at our adjusted constant-dollar basis financial measures.

Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Results (unaudited) We use non-GAAP financial measures of our performance which exclude certain items which we believe are not representative of our continuing operations, as they may be non-recurring or have no cash impact, and may distort our longer-term operating trends. We consider non-GAAP measures useful to investors because they provide greater transparency into management’s view and assessment of our ongoing operating performance. • Gains and losses on equity investments. Gains and losses on equity investments include periodic non-cash fair value adjustments and gains and losses upon sale of an investment. These long-term investments are strategic in nature and are primarily private company investments. Gains and losses associated with these investments are tied to the performance of the companies that we invest in and therefore do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business. • Amortization of acquired intangible assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, customer relationships and brands acquired in connection with business combinations executed beginning in fiscal 2019. Amortization charges for our acquired intangible assets are non-cash and are significantly affected by the timing, frequency and size of our acquisitions, rather than our core operations. As such, we have excluded this amount to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance. • Acquisition-related costs. Acquisition-related costs consist primarily of one-time transaction and integration costs associated with our business combinations. These costs include professional fees, technology integration fees, restructuring activities and other direct costs related to the purchase and integration of acquired entities. These costs also include retention equity and deferred equity compensation when they are agreed upon as part of the purchase price of the transaction but are required to be recognized as expense post-combination. We have excluded these amounts as the expenses are recognized for a limited duration and do not reflect the underlying performance of our business. • Litigation provision. We recorded additional accruals to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. Under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, we recover the monetary liabilities related to the U.S. covered litigation through a downward adjustment to the rate at which shares of our class B common stock ultimately convert into shares of class A common stock. • Russia-Ukraine charges. We recorded a loss within general and administrative expense from the deconsolidation of our Russian subsidiary and also incurred charges in personnel expense as a result of steps taken to support our employees in Russia and Ukraine. We have excluded these amounts as they are one-time charges and do not reflect the underlying performance of our business. Our results are denominated in U.S. dollars and are calculated each quarter by applying an established U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rate for each local currency. To eliminate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar in measuring financial performance, we report year-over-year growth using a fixed current year U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rate for the current and prior year periods (""constant-dollar basis""). 12 Visa Inc.

Fiscal Fourth Quarter 2023 — Financial Highlights GAAP net income in the fiscal fourth quarter was $4.7 billion or $2.27 per share, an increase of 19% and 22%, respectively, over prior year’s results. Current year’s results included a special item of $109 million for a litigation provision associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation (""MDL"") case, $7 million of net gains from equity investments and $67 million from the amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related costs. Prior year’s results included $122 million of net losses from equity investments and $68 million from the amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related costs. Excluding these items from the current and prior year and related tax impacts, non-GAAP net income for the quarter was $4.8 billion or $2.33 per share, increases of 18% and 21%, respectively, over prior year’s results (refer to the accompanying financial tables for further details and a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures presented). GAAP earnings per share growth was approximately 22% on a constant-dollar basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar. Non-GAAP earnings per share growth was approximately 21% on a constant-dollar basis. All references to earnings per share assume fully-diluted class A share count. Net revenues in the fiscal fourth quarter were $8.6 billion, an increase of 11%, driven by the year-over-year growth in payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions. Net revenues increased 10% on a constant-dollar basis. Payments volume for the three months ended June 30, 2023, on which fiscal fourth quarter service revenues are recognized, increased 9% over the prior year on a constant-dollar basis. Payments volume for the three months ended September 30, 2023 increased 9% over the prior year on a constant-dollar basis. Cross-border volume excluding transactions within Europe, which drives our international transaction revenues, increased 18% on a constant-dollar basis for the three months ended September 30, 2023. Total cross-border volume on a constant-dollar basis increased 16% in the quarter. Total processed transactions, which represent transactions processed by Visa, for the three months ended September 30, 2023, were 56.0 billion, a 10% increase over the prior year. Fiscal fourth quarter service revenues were $3.9 billion, an increase of 12% over the prior year, and are recognized based on payments volume in the prior quarter. All other revenue categories are recognized based on current quarter activity. Data processing revenues rose 13% over the prior year to $4.3 billion. International transaction revenues grew 10% over the prior year to $3.2 billion. Other revenues of $744 million rose 35% over the prior year. Client incentives were $3.4 billion, up 20% over the prior year. GAAP operating expenses were $3.1 billion for the fiscal fourth quarter, a 13% increase over the prior year's results, primarily driven by increases in personnel expenses and the litigation provision. GAAP operating expenses included the litigation provision in the current year and the amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related costs in the current and prior year. Excluding these operating expense items, non-GAAP operating expenses increased 9% over the prior year, primarily driven by increases in personnel and general and administrative expenses. GAAP non-operating income was $86 million for the fiscal fourth quarter, including $7 million of net gains from equity investments. Excluding this item, non-GAAP non-operating income was $79 million. GAAP effective income tax rate was 16.9% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023, including the tax impacts from the non-GAAP items. Excluding these items, the non-GAAP effective income tax rate was 17.0% for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates had a tax benefit related to the extension of U.S. foreign tax credit regulations. Cash, cash equivalents and investment securities were $22.0 billion at September 30, 2023. The weighted-average number of diluted shares of class A common stock outstanding was 2.07 billion for the quarter ended September 30, 2023. 2 Fiscal Full-Year 2023 — Financial Highlights (1) GAAP net income in the fiscal full-year 2023 was $17.3 billion or $8.28 per share, an increase of 15% and 18%, respectively, over prior year’s results. Current year’s results included a special item of $906 million for a litigation provision associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation (""MDL"") case, $104 million of net losses from equity investments and $266 million from the amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related costs. Prior year’s results included a special item of $861 million for a litigation provision associated with the interchange MDL case, $264 million of net losses from equity investments, $189 million from the amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related costs, and $60 million from the Russia-Ukraine charges. Excluding these items from the current and prior year and related tax impacts, non-GAAP net income for the year was $18.3 billion or $8.77 per share, increases of 14% and 17%, respectively, over prior year’s results (refer to the accompanying financial tables for further details and a reconciliation of the GAAP to non-GAAP measures presented). GAAP earnings per share growth was approximately 21% on a constant-dollar basis, which excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar. Non-GAAP earnings per share growth was approximately 19% on a constant-dollar basis. All references to earnings per share assume fully-diluted class A share count. Net revenues in the fiscal full-year 2023 were $32.7 billion, an increase of 11%, driven by the year-over-year growth in payments volume, cross-border volume and processed transactions. Net revenues increased 13% on a constant-dollar basis. Payments volume for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023 increased 9% over the prior year on a constant-dollar basis. Cross-border volume excluding transactions within Europe, which drives our international transaction revenues, increased 25% on a constant-dollar basis for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023. Total cross-border volume on a constant-dollar basis increased 20% for the fiscal year. Total processed transactions, which represent transactions processed by Visa, for the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, were 212.6 billion, a 10% increase over the prior year. Fiscal full-year 2023 service revenues were $14.8 billion, an increase of 11% over the prior year. Data processing revenues rose 11% over the prior year to $16.0 billion. International transaction revenues grew 19% over the prior year to $11.6 billion. Other revenues of $2.5 billion rose 24% over the prior year. Client incentives were $12.3 billion, up 19% over the prior year. GAAP operating expenses were $11.7 billion for the fiscal full-year 2023, an 11% increase over the prior year's results, primarily driven by increases in personnel expenses. GAAP operating expenses included the special item related to the litigation provision associated with the MDL case and the amortization of acquired intangible assets and acquisition-related costs in the current and prior year and the Russia-Ukraine charges in the prior year. Excluding these operating expense items, non-GAAP operating expenses increased 12% over the prior year, primarily driven by an increase in personnel expenses. GAAP non-operating income was $37 million for the fiscal full-year 2023, including $104 million of net equity investment losses. Excluding this item, non-GAAP non-operating income was $141 million. GAAP effective income tax rate was 17.9% for the fiscal full-year 2023, including the tax impacts from the non-GAAP items. Excluding these items, the non-GAAP effective income tax rate was 18.1% for the fiscal full-year ended September 30, 2023. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates had a tax benefit due to the reassessment of an uncertain tax position related to prior years as a result of new information obtained during an ongoing tax examination and a tax benefit related to the extension of the U.S. foreign tax credit regulations. The weighted-average number of diluted shares of class A common stock outstanding was 2.09 billion for the fiscal full-year ended September 30, 2023. (1) As previously disclosed, in March 2022, we suspended our operations in Russia and therefore our financial highlights from April 2022 through September 2023 do not include Russia-related results. 3 Other Notable Items On September 13, 2023, Visa announced that it is engaging with its common stockholders on the subject of potential amendments to its Seventh Restated Certificate of Incorporation that would authorize Visa to conduct an exchange offer program that would have the effect of releasing transfer restrictions on portions of Visa's class B common stock in a manner that is designed to be economically equivalent to existing arrangements with respect to class A and class C common stockholders' exposure to certain litigation. On September 28, 2023, Visa deposited $150 million into its litigation escrow account, which was previously established under the Company's U.S. retrospective responsibility plan to insulate the Company and class A shareholders from financial liability for certain litigation cases. This deposit has the same economic effect on earnings per share as repurchasing the Company's class A common stock as it reduces the as-converted class B common stock share count at a volume weighted average price of $231.05. During th e three months ended September 30, 2023, Visa repurchased 17.0 million shares of class A common stock at an average cost of $241.03 per share for $4.1 billion. In the twelve months ended September 30, 2023, Visa repurchased a total of 55.4 million shares of class A common stock at an average cost of $222.98 per share for $12.4 billion. The Company had $4.7 billion of remaining authorized funds for share repurchase as of September 30, 2023. In October, the board of directors authorized a new $25.0 billion multi-year class A common stock share repurchase program. The board of directors also declared an increase to Visa's quarterly cash dividend to $0.520 per share of class A common stock (determined in the case of class B and C common stock and series A, B and C convertible participating preferred stock on an as-converted basis) payable on December 1, 2023, to all holders of record as of November 9, 2023. 4 Financial Outlook for Fiscal Full-Year 2024 Our non-GAAP and adjusted constant-dollar fiscal full-year financial outlook excludes certain items that we believe are not representative of our continuing operations, as they may be non-recurring or have no cash impact, and may distort our longer-term operating trends. We believe presenting these metrics provides investors and management with additional insight into our expected operating performance for fiscal full-year 2024. Growth rates compare our GAAP, non-GAAP and adjusted constant-dollar fiscal full-year 2024 outlook against our GAAP, non-GAAP and adjusted constant-dollar fiscal full-year 2023 financial results, respectively. Please refer to the footnotes in the table immediately below and the Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Results for more information. Such financial measures should not be relied upon as substitutes for, or considered in isolation from, measures calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Annual Net Revenues Growth (1) Annual Operating Expense Growth Annual Diluted Class A Common Stock Earnings Per Share Growth GAAP Nominal-Dollar Basis High single-digit to low double-digit Approximately flat High-teens Non-GAAP Adjustments (2) N/A ~9% (~5.5%) Non-GAAP Nominal-Dollar Basis High single-digit to low double-digit High single-digit Low-teens Foreign Currency Impact (3) ~1% ~1.5% ~0.5% Acquisition Impact (4) —% —% —% Adjusted Constant-Dollar Basis (5) Low double-digit High single-digit to low double-digit Low-teens (1) There were no non-GAAP adjustments made to net revenues in our fiscal full-year 2024 financial outlook and fiscal full-year 2023 financial results. (2) Our non-GAAP fiscal full-year 2024 financial outlook for annual operating expense growth and annual diluted Class A common stock earnings per share growth reflect adjustments for the amortization of acquired intangible assets of approximately $150 million and $0.06, respectively, and acquisition-related costs of approximately $80 million and $0.03, respectively. No other 2024 non-GAAP adjustments have been made. (3) Our results are denominated in U.S. dollars and are calculated each quarter by applying an established U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rate for each local currency. To eliminate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar in measuring financial performance, we report year-over-year growth using a fixed current year U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rate for the current and prior year periods (""constant-dollar basis""). (4) We exclude the impact of operating revenues and expenses of acquired entities that were not reflected in the full quarter of the prior year following the close of the acquisition. (5) We exclude from our non-GAAP fiscal full-year 2024 financial outlook the (i) impact of foreign currency to provide currency-neutral growth rates as described in (3) and (ii) the impact of acquisitions as described in (4) to arrive at our adjusted constant-dollar basis financial measures.

Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Results (unaudited) We use non-GAAP financial measures of our performance which exclude certain items which we believe are not representative of our continuing operations, as they may be non-recurring or have no cash impact, and may distort our longer-term operating trends. We consider non-GAAP measures useful to investors because they provide greater transparency into management’s view and assessment of our ongoing operating performance. • Gains and losses on equity investments. Gains and losses on equity investments include periodic non-cash fair value adjustments and gains and losses upon sale of an investment. These long-term investments are strategic in nature and are primarily private company investments. Gains and losses associated with these investments are tied to the performance of the companies that we invest in and therefore do not correlate to the underlying performance of our business. • Amortization of acquired intangible assets. Amortization of acquired intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, customer relationships and brands acquired in connection with business combinations executed beginning in fiscal 2019. Amortization charges for our acquired intangible assets are non-cash and are significantly affected by the timing, frequency and size of our acquisitions, rather than our core operations. As such, we have excluded this amount to facilitate an evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance. • Acquisition-related costs. Acquisition-related costs consist primarily of one-time transaction and integration costs associated with our business combinations. These costs include professional fees, technology integration fees, restructuring activities and other direct costs related to the purchase and integration of acquired entities. These costs also include retention equity and deferred equity compensation when they are agreed upon as part of the purchase price of the transaction but are required to be recognized as expense post-combination. We have excluded these amounts as the expenses are recognized for a limited duration and do not reflect the underlying performance of our business. • Litigation provision. We recorded additional accruals to address claims associated with the interchange multidistrict litigation. Under the U.S. retrospective responsibility plan, we recover the monetary liabilities related to the U.S. covered litigation through a downward adjustment to the rate at which shares of our class B common stock ultimately convert into shares of class A common stock. • Russia-Ukraine charges. We recorded a loss within general and administrative expense from the deconsolidation of our Russian subsidiary and also incurred charges in personnel expense as a result of steps taken to support our employees in Russia and Ukraine. We have excluded these amounts as they are one-time charges and do not reflect the underlying performance of our business. Our results are denominated in U.S. dollars and are calculated each quarter by applying an established U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rate for each local currency. To eliminate the impact of foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar in measuring financial performance, we report year-over-year growth using a fixed current year U.S. dollar/foreign currency exchange rate for the current and prior year periods (""constant-dollar basis""). 12 Visa Inc.

We believe that these measures provide useful perspective on underlying business trends (i.e. trends excluding non-recurring or unusual items) and results and provide a supplemental measure of year-on-year results. The non-GAAP measures described below are used by Management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for business strategy purposes. These measures may be useful to investors as they provide supplemental information about business performance and provide investors a view of our business results through the eyes of Management. Certain of these measures are also used to evaluate senior management and are a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. These non-GAAP measures are not intended to be considered by the user in place of the related GAAP measure, but rather as supplemental information to our business results. These non-GAAP measures may not be the same as similar measures used by other companies due to possible differences in method and in the items or events being adjusted. The Company is not able to reconcile its forward-looking non-GAAP cash flow measure because the Company cannot predict the timing and amounts of discrete items such as acquisition and divestitures, which could significantly impact GAAP results. The measures provided are as follows: 1. Organic sales growth — page 3 2. Core EPS and currency-neutral Core EPS — page 3 3. Adjusted free cash flow productivity – page 4 Organic sales growth*: Organic sales growth is a non-GAAP measure of sales growth excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures, the impact from the July 1, 2018 adoption of new accounting standards for “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”, the impact from India Goods and Services Tax changes (which were effective on July 1, 2017) and foreign exchange from year-over-year comparisons. Management believes this measure provides investors with a supplemental understanding of underlying sales trends by providing sales growth on a consistent basis. The Core earnings measures included in the following reconciliation tables refer to the equivalent GAAP measures adjusted as applicable for the following items: • Incremental restructuring: The Company has had and continues to have an ongoing level of restructuring activities. Such activities have resulted in ongoing annual restructuring related charges of approximately $250 - $500 million before tax. In 2012 the Company began a $10 billion strategic productivity and cost savings initiative that included incremental restructuring activities. In 2017, the Company communicated details of an additional multi-year productivity and cost savings plan. This results in incremental restructuring charges to accelerate productivity efforts and cost savings. The adjustment to Core earnings includes only the restructuring costs above what we believe are the normal recurring level of restructuring costs. • Gain on Dissolution of the PGT Healthcare Partnership: The Company finalized the dissolution of our PGT Healthcare partnership, a venture between the Company and Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries, Ltd (Teva) in the OTC consumer healthcare business, in the quarter ended September 30, 2018. The transaction was accounted for as a sale of the Teva portion of the PGT business; the Company recognized an after-tax gain on the dissolution of $353 million. We do not view the above items to be part of our sustainable results, and their exclusion from core earnings measures provides a more comparable measure of year-on-year results. These items are also excluded when evaluating senior management in determining their at-risk compensation. Management views the following non-GAAP measures as useful supplemental measures of Company performance and operating efficiency over time. Core EPS and currency-neutral Core EPS*: Core earnings per share, or Core EPS, is a measure of the Company's diluted net earnings per share from continuing operations adjusted as indicated. Currency-neutral Core EPS is a measure of the Company's Core EPS excluding the incremental current year impact of foreign exchange. Adjusted free cash flow: Adjusted free cash flow is defined as operating cash flow less capital spending and adjustments for items as indicated. Adjusted free cash flow represents the cash that the Company is able to generate after taking into account planned maintenance and asset expansion. Management views adjusted free cash flow as an important measure because it is one factor used in determining the amount of cash available for dividends, share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investment. Adjusted free cash flow productivity*: Adjusted free cash flow productivity is defined as the ratio of adjusted free cash flow to net earnings adjusted for items as indicated. Management views adjusted free cash flow productivity as a useful measure to help investors understand P&G’s ability to generate cash. Adjusted free cash flow productivity is used by management in making operating decisions, allocating financial resources and for budget planning purposes. The Company's long-term target is to generate annual free cash flow productivity at or above 90 percent. * Measure is used to evaluate senior management and is a factor in determining their at-risk compensation. 1.
