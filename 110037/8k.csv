Consistent with its previous guidance for 2019 , the Company continues to expect: • Full-year organic revenue growth to be 4 percent. • A core effective tax rate of approximately 21 percent. • A decline in core constant currency EPS of approximately 1 percent, which incorporates lapping a number of 2018 strategic asset-sale and refranchising gains, the expected increased core effective tax rate, and expected 2019 incremental investments to strengthen the business. • Approximately $9 billion in cash from operating activities and free cash flow of approximately $5 billion, which assumes net capital spending of approximately $4.5 billion. • Total cash returns to shareholders of approximately $8 billion, comprised of dividends of approximately $5 billion and share repurchases of approximately $3 billion. Applying current market consensus rates implies a 2-percentage-point foreign exchange translation headwind to both reported net revenue and EPS performance. This assumption and the guidance above implies 2019 core earnings per share of $5.50, a 3 percent decrease compared to 2018 core earnings per share of $5.66. Conference Call: At 7:45 a.m. (Eastern Time) today, the Company will host a conference call with investors and financial analysts to discuss second quarter 2019 results and the outlook for 2019 .

We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results, and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends. We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring programs; charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as significant tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; amounts associated with mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; pension and retiree medical related items; asset impairments (non-cash); and remeasurements of net monetary assets. See below for a description of adjustments to our U.S. GAAP financial measures included herein. Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. Glossary We use the following definitions when referring to our non-GAAP financial measures, which may not be the same as or comparable to similar measures presented by other companies: Acquisitions and divestitures: All mergers and acquisitions activity, including the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees. Beverage volume: Volume shipped to retailers and independent distributors from both PepsiCo and our bottlers. Constant currency: Financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current year U.S. dollar results by the current year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior year average foreign exchange rates. Core: Core results are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items from our historical results. For further information regarding these excluded items for the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 15, 2019 and June 16, 2018 , refer to “Items Affecting Comparability” in “Item 2 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Q2 2019 Form 10-Q. For further information regarding these excluded items for the year ended December 29, 2018, refer to “Items Affecting Comparability” in “Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 . For the periods presented, core results exclude the following items: Mark-to-market net impact Mark-to-market net gains and losses on commodity derivatives in corporate unallocated expenses. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Restructuring and impairment charges Expenses related to the multi-year productivity plans publicly announced on February 15, 2019 and in 2014. Inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges Charges related to our acquisition of Sodastream, including incremental costs related to fair value adjustments to the acquired inventory, as well as merger and integration charges. A - 5 Tax benefit/net tax expense related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. Among its many provisions, the TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings and reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. In periods subsequent to the enactment of the TCJ Act, we recognized certain tax benefits and/or expenses associated therewith. While our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act as of December 29, 2018 was deemed to be complete, this amount was based on prevailing regulations and available information as of December 29, 2018, and additional guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) impacted, and may continue to impact, our recorded amounts after December 29, 2018. Other net tax benefits In the year ended December 29, 2018, other net tax benefits related to the reorganization of our international operations and non-cash tax benefits associated with both the conclusion of certain international tax audits and our agreement with the IRS resolving all open matters related to the audits of taxable years 2012 and 2013. Charges related to cash tender and exchange offers In the year ended December 29, 2018, interest expense in connection with our cash tender and exchange offers, primarily representing the tender price paid over the carrying value of the tendered notes. Effective net pricing: Reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries. Free cash flow: Net cash provided by operating activities less capital spending, plus sales of property, plant and equipment. Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities. Free cash flow is used by us primarily for financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure. Net capital spending: Capital spending less cash proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment. Organic: A measure that adjusts for impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes and foreign exchange translation. 2019 guidance Our 2019 organic revenue growth guidance excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes and foreign exchange translation. Our 2019 core tax rate guidance and 2019 core constant currency EPS performance guidance exclude the mark-to-market net impact included in corporate unallocated expenses and restructuring and impairment charges. Our 2019 core constant currency EPS performance guidance also excludes the impact of foreign exchange translation. We are unable to reconcile our full year projected 2019 organic revenue growth to our full year projected 2019 reported net revenue growth because we are unable to predict the 2019 impact of foreign exchange due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and because we are unable to predict the occurrence or impact of any acquisitions, divestitures or other structural changes. We are also unable to reconcile our full year projected 2019 core tax rate to our full year projected 2019 reported tax rate, or our full year projected 2019 core constant currency EPS performance to our full year projected 2019 reported EPS performance because we are unable to predict the 2019 impact of foreign exchange or the mark-to-market net impact on commodity derivatives due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. Therefore, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of these measures.

Please refer to the reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP information in the attached exhibits and to the Glossary for definitions of “Organic,” “Core” and “Constant Currency.” 3 2019 Guidance and Outlook The Company provides guidance on a non-GAAP basis as the Company cannot predict certain elements which are included in reported GAAP results, including the impact of foreign exchange translation and mark-to-market impacts. Consistent with its previous guidance for 2019 , the Company continues to expect: • Full-year organic revenue growth to be 4 percent. • A core effective tax rate of approximately 21 percent. • A decline in core constant currency EPS of approximately 1 percent, which incorporates lapping a number of 2018 strategic asset-sale and refranchising gains, the expected increased core effective tax rate, and expected 2019 incremental investments to strengthen the business. • Approximately $9 billion in cash from operating activities and free cash flow of approximately $5 billion, which assumes net capital spending of approximately $4.5 billion. • Total cash returns to shareholders of approximately $8 billion, comprised of dividends of approximately $5 billion and share repurchases of approximately $3 billion. Applying current market consensus rates implies a 2-percentage-point foreign exchange translation headwind to both reported net revenue and EPS performance. This assumption and the guidance above implies 2019 core earnings per share of $5.50, a 3 percent decrease compared to 2018 core earnings per share of $5.66. Conference Call: At 7:45 a.m. (Eastern Time) today, the Company will host a conference call with investors and financial analysts to discuss second quarter 2019 results and the outlook for 2019 . Further details will be accessible on the Company’s website at www.pepsico.com/investors .

We use these non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results, and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends. We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring programs; charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as significant tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; amounts associated with mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; pension and retiree medical related items; asset impairments (non-cash); and remeasurements of net monetary assets. See below for a description of adjustments to our U.S. GAAP financial measures included herein. Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. Glossary We use the following definitions when referring to our non-GAAP financial measures, which may not be the same as or comparable to similar measures presented by other companies: Acquisitions and divestitures: All mergers and acquisitions activity, including the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees. Beverage volume: Volume shipped to retailers and independent distributors from both PepsiCo and our bottlers. Constant currency: Financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current year U.S. dollar results by the current year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior year average foreign exchange rates. Core: Core results are non-GAAP financial measures which exclude certain items from our historical results. For further information regarding these excluded items for the 12 and 24 weeks ended June 15, 2019 and June 16, 2018 , refer to “Items Affecting Comparability” in “Item 2 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Q2 2019 Form 10-Q. For further information regarding these excluded items for the year ended December 29, 2018, refer to “Items Affecting Comparability” in “Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 29, 2018 . For the periods presented, core results exclude the following items: Mark-to-market net impact Mark-to-market net gains and losses on commodity derivatives in corporate unallocated expenses. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Restructuring and impairment charges Expenses related to the multi-year productivity plans publicly announced on February 15, 2019 and in 2014. Inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges Charges related to our acquisition of Sodastream, including incremental costs related to fair value adjustments to the acquired inventory, as well as merger and integration charges. A - 5 Tax benefit/net tax expense related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. Among its many provisions, the TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings and reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. In periods subsequent to the enactment of the TCJ Act, we recognized certain tax benefits and/or expenses associated therewith. While our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act as of December 29, 2018 was deemed to be complete, this amount was based on prevailing regulations and available information as of December 29, 2018, and additional guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) impacted, and may continue to impact, our recorded amounts after December 29, 2018. Other net tax benefits In the year ended December 29, 2018, other net tax benefits related to the reorganization of our international operations and non-cash tax benefits associated with both the conclusion of certain international tax audits and our agreement with the IRS resolving all open matters related to the audits of taxable years 2012 and 2013. Charges related to cash tender and exchange offers In the year ended December 29, 2018, interest expense in connection with our cash tender and exchange offers, primarily representing the tender price paid over the carrying value of the tendered notes. Effective net pricing: Reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries. Free cash flow: Net cash provided by operating activities less capital spending, plus sales of property, plant and equipment. Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities. Free cash flow is used by us primarily for financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure. Net capital spending: Capital spending less cash proceeds from sales of property, plant and equipment. Organic: A measure that adjusts for impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes and foreign exchange translation. 2019 guidance Our 2019 organic revenue growth guidance excludes the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes and foreign exchange translation. Our 2019 core tax rate guidance and 2019 core constant currency EPS performance guidance exclude the mark-to-market net impact included in corporate unallocated expenses and restructuring and impairment charges. Our 2019 core constant currency EPS performance guidance also excludes the impact of foreign exchange translation. We are unable to reconcile our full year projected 2019 organic revenue growth to our full year projected 2019 reported net revenue growth because we are unable to predict the 2019 impact of foreign exchange due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and because we are unable to predict the occurrence or impact of any acquisitions, divestitures or other structural changes. We are also unable to reconcile our full year projected 2019 core tax rate to our full year projected 2019 reported tax rate, or our full year projected 2019 core constant currency EPS performance to our full year projected 2019 reported EPS performance because we are unable to predict the 2019 impact of foreign exchange or the mark-to-market net impact on commodity derivatives due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. Therefore, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of these measures.
