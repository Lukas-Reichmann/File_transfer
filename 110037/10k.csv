Business Ponce Financial Group, Inc. Ponce Financial Group, Inc., as the successor by merger with PDL Community Bancorp pursuant to the completion of the conversion and reorganization of Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company from the mutual holding company to the stock holding company form of organization that was effective on January 27, 2022 (hereafter referred to as “we,” “our,” “us,” “Ponce Financial Group, Inc.,” or the “Company”), is the holding company of Ponce Bank (“Ponce Bank” or the “Bank”), a federally chartered stock savings association. The Company is authorized to pursue other business activities permitted by applicable laws and regulations for savings and loan holding companies, which may include the acquisition of banking and financial services companies. The Company’s cash flow is dependent on earnings from investments and any dividends received from Ponce Bank. Ponce Financial Group, Inc. does not own nor lease any property, but instead uses the premises, equipment and furniture of Ponce Bank. At the present time, the Company employs only persons who are officers of Ponce Bank to serve as officers of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. It uses the support staff of Ponce Bank from time to time. These persons are not separately compensated by Ponce Financial Group, Inc. Ponce Financial Group, Inc. may hire additional employees, as appropriate, to the extent it so determines in the future. The Company’s executive office is located at 2244 Westchester Avenue, Bronx, New York 10462, and the telephone number at that address is (718) 931-9000. Available Information Under Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), Ponce Financial Group, Inc. is required to file annual, quarterly, and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). The Company electronically files its annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and other reports as required with the SEC. The SEC website, www.sec.gov, provides access to all Company filings which have been filed electronically. Additionally, the Company’s SEC filings and additional shareholders’ information are available free of charge on the Bank’s website, www.poncebank.com (within the Investor Relations section). The references to our website address and the SEC’s website address do not constitute incorporation by reference of the information contained in those websites and should not be considered part of this annual report. The Company’s common stock is traded on The NASDAQ Stock Market, LLC under the symbol “PDLB.” Ponce Bank Ponce Bank is a federally-chartered stock savings association headquartered in the Bronx, New York. Ponce Bank was originally chartered in 1960 as a federally-chartered mutual savings and loan association under the name Ponce De Leon Federal Savings and Loan Association. In 1985, the Bank changed its name to “Ponce De Leon Federal Savings Bank.” In 1997, the Bank changed its name again to “Ponce De Leon Federal Bank.” In 2017, the Bank adopted its current name. The Bank is designated as a Minority Depository Institution (“MDI”) and a Community Development Financial Institution (“CDFI”) under applicable regulations and is a certified Small Business Administration (“SBA’) lender. The Company’s business is conducted through the administrative office and 13 full service banking offices and 6 mortgage loan offices. The banking offices are located in New York City – the Bronx (4 branches), Queens (3 branches), Brooklyn (3 branches), Manhattan (2 branches) and Union City (1 branch), New Jersey. The mortgage loan offices are located in Queens (4) and Brooklyn (1), New York and Bergenfield (1), New Jersey. The Company’s primary market area currently consists of the New York City metropolitan area. The Bank’s business primarily consists of taking deposits from the general public and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings, in mortgage loans, consisting of one-to-four family residential (both investor-owned and owner-occupied), multifamily residential, nonresidential properties, construction and land, and in business and consumer loans. The Bank also invests in securities, which have historically consisted of U.S. government and federal agency securities and securities issued by government-sponsored or owned enterprises, as well as, mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds and Federal Home Loan Bank of New York (the “FHLBNY”) stock. The Bank offers a variety of deposit accounts, including demand, savings, money markets, NOW/IOLA accounts, reciprocal deposits and certificates of deposit accounts. 1 Mortgage World Bankers, Inc. On January 26, 2022, the assets and liabilities of Mortgage World Bankers, Inc. (“Mortgage World”), a wholly owned subsidiary of PDL Community Bancorp, were transferred to the Bank. Except for the winding up of its operations, Mortgage World ceased to conduct business as a separate entity at that time. Mortgage World was a mortgage banking entity subject to the comprehensive regulation and examination of the New York State Department of Financial Services. The primary business of Mortgage World was the taking of applications from the general public for residential mortgage loans, underwriting them to investors’ standards, closing and funding them and holding them until they were sold to investors. The Company intends that the Bank will continue this mortgage banking business as a division of the Bank. Business Strategy The Company’s goal is to provide long-term value to our stockholders, customers, employees and the communities we serve (collectively our “stakeholders”) by executing a safe and sound business strategy that produces increasing value. The Company believes there is a significant opportunity for an immigrant community-focused, minority directed bank to provide a full range of financial services to commercial and retail customers in our market area and other similar communities. Our current business strategy consists of the following: For additional information related to our business strategies, see “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Vision 2025 Evolves."" Employees and Human Capital Resources As of December 31, 2022, the Company had 253 full time equivalent employees. None of the Company’s employees are represented by a labor union, and management considers its relationship with employees to be good. The Company believes its ability to attract and retain employees is key to its success. Accordingly, the Company strives to offer competitive salaries and employee benefits to all employees and monitors salaries and other compensation in its market area. The Company encourages and supports the growth and development of our employees. Continual learning and career development is advanced through ongoing performance and development conversations with employees, internally developed training programs and educational reimbursement programs. The Company is responsible for creating an equitable workplace ensuring diversity at all management levels. The Company prides itself on establishing a diverse workforce that serves our diverse customer base in the New York metro area. The Company’s inclusion and diversity program focuses on its workforce, workplace, and community. The Company believes that its business is strengthened by a diverse workforce that reflects the communities in which it operates. The Company believes that all of its team members should be treated with respect and equality, regardless of gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, religious beliefs, or other 2 characteristics. The Company has also broadened its focus on inclusion and diversity by including social and racial equity in its conversations and equipping and empowering its team leaders with appropriate tools and training. Market Area The Bank is headquartered in the Bronx, New York, with a primary market in the other boroughs of New York City (excluding Staten Island) and Hudson County, New Jersey. The size and complex nature of the geographic footprint makes for diverse demographics that continue to undergo significant changes, in terms of economic, racial, ethnic and age parameters, all with potentially substantial long-term institutional ramifications. The Bank’s primary deposit base includes a large and stable base of locally employed blue-collar workers with low-to-medium income, middle-aged, and with limited investment funds. Within the base of locally employed blue-collar workers there is a significant, and growing, portion of recently immigrated, younger, lower-skilled laborers. The influx of immigrant lower-skilled workers, however, has been hampered by the increases in rental rates in the rental housing market within the New York City metropolitan area. Another significant customer segment of the Bank consists of middle aged and older white-collar, high-income individuals, many of whom are self-employed real estate investors and developers. They constitute a large percentage of the borrowing base of the Bank and, increasingly, are becoming the source of a significant percentage of commercial deposits. The Bank has historically been funded through local community deposits. The Bank continues to rely primarily on community deposits from its market areas to fund investments and loans. However, the mix of community deposits now includes demand and money market funds of consumer, commercial and not-for-profit entities, with a decreasing reliance on time deposits. Additionally, the Bank has been using alternative funding sources such as brokered deposits and FHLBNY advances to support loan growth. Competition The Company faces significant competition within its market area both in originating loans and attracting deposits. There is a high concentration of financial institutions in the market area, including national, regional and other locally-operated commercial banks, savings banks, savings associations and credit unions whose activities include banking as well as mortgage lending. Several “mega” banks exist in the market, such as JPMorgan Chase, Citibank and Capital One, many of whom are continuing to push for retail deposits and home mortgages. A number of the Bank’s competitors offer non-deposit products and services that the Bank does not currently offer, such as trust services, private banking, insurance services and asset management. Additionally, the Company faces an increasing level of competition from non-core financial service providers that do not necessarily maintain a physical presence in the Bank’s market area, such as Radius Bank, Quicken Loans, Freedom Mortgage and many internet financial service providers. The amount of competition facing the Company is extensive and can negatively impact its growth. The market share of bank deposits in the New York area can be difficult to quantify, as some “mega” banks will include large scale deposits from around the world as held at headquarters. However, in Bronx County, New York, where the Bank maintains four branches, it holds 1.67% (as of June 30, 2022) of the market’s deposits. This represents the Bank’s largest market share in a county-level area. The Bank continues to work to improve its market position by expanding its brand within its current market area, and building its capacity to provide more products and services to its customers. 3 Lending Activities General . The Bank’s principal lending activity is originating real estate-secured loans, including one-to-four family investor-owned and owner-occupied residential, multifamily residential, nonresidential property, construction and land loans, and commercial and industrial (“C&I”) business loans and consumer loans. It originates real estate and other loans through its loan officers, marketing efforts, customer base, walk-in customers and referrals from real estate brokers, builders and attorneys. During 2021 and 2020, the Bank focused on making SBA Paycheck Protection Program (""PPP"") loans within its market area, to both customers and non-customers. Subject to market conditions and its asset-liability analysis, the Bank looks to maintain its emphasis on multifamily residential and nonresidential property loans while growing the overall loan portfolio and increasing the overall yield earned on loans. Additionally, the Bank has entered into a partnership with Grain. Through Grain, the Bank provides a consumer line of credit using a mobile application geared nationally to the underbanked and new generations entering the financial services market that uses non-traditional underwriting methodologies. In establishing these lines of credit, the Company reserved the right to modify borrowers’ credit limits at its sole discretion. As discussed under Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations‎, Factors Affecting the Comparability of Results, Write-off and Write-Down of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company has taken a write-off and write-down relative to these loans due to cyber-fraud experienced by Grain. The Company has requested, and Grain has agreed, that no new microloans be originated until further notice and that further ‎extensions of credit to an existing microloan borrower only be made upon confirmation that such borrower is not fraudulent. ‎These Grain loans are reflected in the consumer loan portfolio. Lending activities are conducted primarily by the Bank’s salaried loan officers operating at its main and branch office locations as well as remotely. It also conducts lending activities through its subsidiary Ponce De Leon Mortgage Corporation. All loan originations are underwritten pursuant to the Bank’s policies and procedures. The Bank currently intends that substantially all of its mortgage loan originations will have adjustable interest rates. For its non-PPP business loan originations, variable rate pricing is offered based on prime rate plus a margin. Loan Portfolio Composition. The following table sets forth the composition of the Bank’s loan portfolio by type of loan (excluding mortgage loans held for sale) at the dates indicated. Loans in process at December 31, 2022 and 2021 were $205.6 million and $118.9 million, respectively.

The following table provides a breakdown of the Bank’s loan portfolio by product type and principal balance outstanding at December 31, 2022, excluding mortgage loans held for sale. At December 31, 2022 Loan Type # of Loans Principal Balance % of Portfolio (Dollars in thousands) Mortgage loans: 1-4 Family residential Investor-owned 550 $ 343,968 22.54 % Owner-occupied 273 134,878 8.84 % Multifamily residential 358 494,667 32.42 % Nonresidential properties 210 308,043 20.19 % Construction and land Construction 1-4 Investor 3 5,831 0.38 % Construction Multifamily 32 148,656 9.75 % Construction Nonresidential 7 29,616 1.94 % Land loan 1 915 0.06 % Nonmortgage loans: Business loans C&I lines of credit 55 13,419 0.88 % C&I loans (term) 24 6,515 0.43 % PPP loans 71 20,031 1.31 % Consumer loans Unsecured (1) 27,910 18,569 1.22 % Passbook 76 560 0.04 % Grand Total 29,570 $ 1,525,668 100.00 % One-to-four Family Investor-Owned Loans. At December 31, 2022, one-to-four family investor-owned loans were $344.0 million, or 22.6% of the Bank’s total loans. Investor-owned mortgage loans secured by non-owner-occupied one-to-four family residential property represents the Bank’s second largest lending concentration. The majority of the portfolio, $301.0 million, or 87.5%, are two-to-four family properties (462 accounts), while the remaining $43.0 million, or 12.5%, are primarily single family, non-owner-occupied investment properties (89 accounts). Of the three largest loans in this category, two loans had outstanding balances of $2.9 million each and one loan had an outstanding balance of $2.8 million. In this category, loans totaling $127.2 million, or 37.0%, are secured by properties located in Queens County, $112.4 million, or 32.7%, in Kings County, $32.7 million, or 9.5%, in Bronx County, $12.9 million, or 3.8%, in New York County, $12.1 million, or 3.5%, in Westchester County, $10.2 million, or 3.0%, in Nassau County, $10.0 million, or 2.9%, in Hudson County and $7.5 million, or 2.2% in Suffolk County. The rest of this category, 5.5%, is spread out in other counties and no other concentration exceeded $5.5 million, or 1.4%. The Bank imposes prudent underwriting guidelines in the origination of such loans, including lower maximum loan-to-value ratios (“LTVs”) of 70% on purchases and 65% on refinances, a required minimum debt service coverage ratio (“DSCR,” net operating income divided by debt service requirement) of 1.20x that must be met by either the property on a standalone basis or by the inclusion of the owner(s) as co-borrower(s). In addition, all origination of such loans currently require that the transaction exhibit a global debt service coverage ratio (net operating income divided by debt service requirement) of no less than 1.0x. This coverage ratio indicates that the owner has the capacity to support the loan along with all personal obligations. On occasion, the Bank has required that the borrower establish a cash reserve to be held at the Bank in order to provide additional security. The maximum term on such loans is 30 years, typically with five-year adjustable rates. One-to-four family investor-owned real estate loans involve a greater degree of risk than one-to-four family owner-occupied real estate loans. Rather than depending on the borrower’s repayment ability from employment or other income, the borrower’s repayment ability is primarily dependent on ensuring that a tenant occupies the investor property and has the financial capacity to pay sufficient rent to cover the borrower’s debt. In addition, if an investor borrower has several loans secured by properties in the same market, the loans have risks similar to a multifamily real estate loan and repayment of those loans is subject to adverse conditions in the rental market or the local economy. 5 One-to-four Family Owner-occupied Loans. One-to-four family owner-occupied loans totaled $134.9 million, or 8.8% of the Bank’s total loan portfolio at December 31, 2022. The three largest loans outstanding in this category had outstanding balances of $2.6 million, $2.2 million and $2.0 million. There are 28 loans with an outstanding balance in excess of $1.0 million, totaling $39.1 million, or approximately 29.0% of this category. At December 31, 2022, approximately $43.4 million, or 32.2%, of this category was secured by properties located in Queens County, $32.4 million, or 24.0%, in Kings County, $12.8 million, or 9.5%, in New York County, $12.1 million, or 8.9%, in Bronx County, $12.0 million, or 8.9%, in Nassau County and $6.1 million, or 4.5%, in Westchester County. The rest of this category, less than 12.0%, is spread out in other counties and no other concentration exceeded $3.7 million, or 2.7%. It is the Bank’s policy to underwrite loans secured by one-to-four family owner-occupied residential real estate in a manner that ensures strict compliance with Dodd-Frank regulatory requirements. This includes underwriting only mortgages that have a debt-to-income ratio of 43% or less or that meet non-qualified mortgage standards. A qualified mortgage is presumed to meet the borrower’s ability to repay the loan. As part of this effort, the Bank employs software that tests each loan for qualified mortgage compliance. As a CDFI, the Bank is authorized to originate non-qualified mortgages. Non-qualified mortgages generally require greater down payments and have higher yields. The Bank generally limits one-to-four family loans to a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 90% for a purchase and 80% for a refinance, based on the lower of the purchase price or appraised value. The maximum loan term is 30 years, self-amortizing. As a portfolio lender, the Bank presently does not offer a fixed-rate product. The Bank currently offers mostly 5/1 and 5/5 adjustable rate loans that adjust based on a spread ranging between 2.75% to 3.00% over the one or five-year FHLBNY rate. The maximum amount by which the interest rate may increase generally is limited to 2% for the first two adjustments and 5% for the life of the loan. Multifamily Loans. Multifamily loans totaled $494.7 million, or 32.4% of the Bank’s total loan portfolio at December 31, 2022. Loans secured by multifamily properties represent the Bank’s largest real estate lending category. The three largest loans were $21.0 million, $17.6 million and $11.9 million. Of the total of $494.7 million in multifamily loans, 146 loans have balances in excess of $1.0 million and account for $386.3 million, or approximately 78.7%, of this lending concentration. In terms of geographical concentrations, $219.4 million, or 44.4%, are secured by properties located in Queens County, $121.8 million, or 24.3%, in Kings County, $45.1 million, or 9.1%, in Bronx County, $39.3 million, or 7.9%, in Nassau County, $30.2 million, or 6.1%, in New York County, $20.7 million, or 4.2%, in Westchester County, $8.0 million, or 1.3%, in Hudson County and $6.8 million, or 1.4%, in Bergen County. All other concentrations by county, which account for 0.7% of this category, have balances of $1.0 million or less. Nonresidential Loans. Nonresidential loans totaled $308.0 million, or 20.2% of the Bank’s total loan portfolio at December 31, 2022. Loans secured by nonresidential properties that represent the Bank’s third largest concentration. The three largest loans were $24.8 million, $10.5 million and $10.0 million. Of the total of $308.0 million in nonresidential loans, 78 loans have balances in excess of $1.0 million and account for $246.2 million, or approximately 79.9%, of this lending concentration. In terms of geographical concentrations, $61.6 million, or 20.0%, are secured by properties located in Bronx County, $60.3 million, or 19.6%, in Kings County, $55.2 million, or 17.9%, in Queens County, $40.3 million, or 13.1%, in Nassau County, $30.9 million, or 10.0%, in New York County, $12.7 million, or 4.1%, in Westchester County, $10.8 million, or 3.5%, in Passaic county, $9.8 million, or 3.2%, in Suffolk county, $7.0 million, or 2.3%, in Marietta County and $4.9 million, or 1.6%, in Bergen county. All other concentrations by county, which account for 4.2% of this category, have balances of $3.3 million or less. In the nonresidential portfolio, the overall mix is diverse in terms of property types, with the largest concentration being retail and wholesale at $105.3 million, or 34.2% of the portfolio, industrial and warehouse at $68.3 million, or 22.2%, offices at $44.0 million, or 14.3%, hotels and motels at $38.1 million, or 12.4%, service, doctor, dentist, daycare and schools at $22.2 million, or 7.2%, restaurants at $8.6 million, or 2.8%, churches at $8.3 million, or 2.7%, medical, nursing home and hospital at $7.8 million, or 2.5%, and the rest of the portfolio accounts for other property types, with none exceeding 1.0% as a portfolio concentration. The Bank considers a number of factors when originating multifamily and nonresidential mortgages. Loans secured by multifamily and nonresidential real estate generally have larger balances and involve a greater degree of risk than one-to-four family residential real estate loans. The primary concern in this type of lending is the borrower’s creditworthiness and the viability and cash flow potential of the property. Payments on loans secured by income-producing properties often depend on successful operation and management of the properties. As a result, repayment of such loans may be more subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy as compared to residential real estate loans. To address the risks involved, the Bank evaluates the qualifications and financial resources of the underlying principal(s) of the borrower, including credit history, profitability and expertise, as well as the value of cash flows and condition of the property securing the loan. When evaluating the qualifications of the borrower, the Bank considers the financial resources of the borrower, the experience of the underlying principal(s) of the borrower in owning or managing similar properties and the borrower’s payment history with the Bank and other financial institutions. In evaluating the property securing the loan, the factors considered include the net operating income of the mortgaged property before debt service and depreciation, the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value or purchase price of the mortgaged property (whichever is lower), and the debt service coverage ratio. All multifamily and nonresidential loans are supported by appraisals that conform to the Bank’s appraisal policy. The Bank generally limits the maximum LTVs on these loans to 75%, based on the lower of the purchase price or appraised value of the subject property (70% on the refinance of nonresidential properties such as retail spaces, office buildings, and warehouses) and a DSCR of 1.20%. The maximum 6 loan term ranges between 25 and 30 years. As is the Bank’s general policy, the Bank offers only adjustable rates on its multifamily and nonresidential mortgages ─ with adjustments based on a spread currently ranging between 2.50% to 3.00% over the five-year FHLBNY rate. Construction and Land Loans. Construction and land loans totaled $185.0 million, or 12.1%, of the Bank’s total loan portfolio at December 31, 2022, (43 projects), with $148.7 million consisting of multifamily residential (32 projects). In terms of geographical concentrations, $106.3 million, or 57.5%, are secured by properties located in Queens County, $20.3 million, or 11.0%, in Kings County, $17.3 million, or 9.4%, in Chestnut Hill County, $9.7 million, or 5.2%, in Bronx County, $7.0 million, or 3.8%, in Hudson county, $6.7 million, or 3.6%, in Nassau county, $6.2 million, or 3.4%, in Richmond county, $5.1 million, or 2.7%, in Suffolk county, $4.1 million, or 2.2%, in Westchester county and $2.3 million, or 1.2%, in New York County. At December 31, 2022, loans in process related to construction loans totaled $205.6 million. The Bank’s typical construction loan has a term of up to 36 months and contains: The Bank’s approach to the underwriting of construction loans is driven by five factors: analysis of the developer; analysis of the contractor; analysis of the project; valuation of the project; and evaluation of the source of repayment. The developer’s character, capacity and capital are analyzed to determine that the individual or entity has the ability to first complete the project and then either sell it or carry permanent financing. The general contractor is analyzed for reputation, sufficient expertise and capacity to complete the project within the allotted time. The project is analyzed in order to ensure that the project will be completed within a reasonable period of time according to the plans and specifications, and can either be sold, rented or refinanced once completed. All construction loans are supported by appraisals which conform to the Bank’s appraisal policy and affirm the value of the project both “As Is” and “As Completed.” Lastly, the Bank reviews the developer’s cash flow estimations for the project on an “As Completed” basis. These projections are compared to the appraiser’s estimates. Debt service coverage using projected rental net income must be at least 1.2x the estimated debt service when operating at stabilized levels. Upon closing of the construction loan, the Bank begins monitoring the project and funding requisitions for completed stages upon inspection and confirmation by third party firms, such as engineers, of the work performed and its value and quality. Conversion to permanent financing usually occurs upon a conversion underwriting and receipt of certificates of occupancy, as applicable. Construction lending involves additional risks when compared with permanent lending because funds are advanced upon the security of the project, which is of uncertain value prior to its completion. Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs, as well as the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation of real property, it is relatively difficult to evaluate accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan-to-value ratio. In addition, during the term of our construction loans, no payment from the borrower is required since the accumulated interest is added to the principal of the loan through an interest reserve. As a result of these uncertainties, construction lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds, with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project rather than the ability of a borrower or guarantor to repay the loan. If we are forced to foreclose on a project prior to completion, there is no assurance that we will be able to recover the entire unpaid portion of the loan. In addition, we may be required to fund additional amounts to complete a project, and it may be necessary to hold the property for an indeterminate period of time subject to the regulatory limitations imposed by local, state or federal laws. Loans on land under development or held for future construction also pose additional risk because of the lack of income being produced by the property and the potential illiquid nature of the collateral . C&I Loans and Lines of Credit. C&I loans (excluding PPP loans) and lines of credit represent 2.6% of the Bank’s total loan portfolio at December 31, 2022. Unlike real estate loans, which are secured by real property, and whose collateral value tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial and industrial loans are of higher risk and typically are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower’s business. The collateral, such as accounts receivable, securing these loans may fluctuate in value. 7 Although the Bank’s loan policy allows for the extension of secured and unsecured financing, the Bank usually seeks to obtain collateral when in initial discussions with potential borrowers. Unsecured credit facilities are made only to strong borrowers that possess established track records with the Bank (or come highly recommended) and are supported by guarantors. Guarantees are required of any individual or entity owning or controlling 20% or more of the borrowing entity, with exceptions requiring approval from the Board of Directors. When credits are not secured by a specific lien on an asset, the Bank usually requires a general lien on all business assets as evidenced by a UCC filing. Pricing is typically based on the Wall Street Journal prime rate plus a spread driven by risk-rating variables. Underwriters are required to identify at least two sources of repayment, usually recommend that loans contain covenants, such as minimum debt service coverage ratios, minimum global debt service coverage ratios, maximum leverage ratios, 30-day “cleanups” or “clean-downs,” as applicable, and must require periodic financial reporting. In addition, every effort is made to set up borrowers with auto-debit for loan payments and strongly encourage them to maintain operating accounts at the Bank. Lines of credit are typically short-term facilities (12 months) that are provided for occasional or seasonal needs. They are extended to only qualifying borrowers who have established cash flow from operations and a clean credit history. At a minimum, a bi-annual 30-day clean-up, or 75% bi-annual pay-down period is required, although annually is preferred. A clean-up period generally is not required on amortizing secured lines. Guarantors, which are usually required, must have clean credit histories and a substantial outside net worth. Most lines contain an option to convert to a term loan upon maturity. Secured term loans are long-term facilities extended typically for the purpose of financing the purchase of a long term asset. At a minimum, they will be collateralized by the asset being purchased. They may also be secured by an existing long term business asset or outside collateral pledged by the guarantor or borrower. Unsecured term loans are usually extended only to well-known borrowers who have established strong cash flow from operations and a clean credit history. Although Bank policy allows term loans for up to ten years, the preference is to offer self-amortizing term loans based on a term of no more than five-to-seven years. Paycheck Protection Program. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) appropriated $349.0 billion for the PPP. On April 24, 2020, the PPP received another $310.0 billion in funding. On December 27, 2020, the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits and Venues Act (the “Economic Aid Act”) appropriated another $284 billion for both first and second draw PPP loans bringing the total appropriations for PPP loans to $943.0 billion. The PPP ended on May 31, 2021. PPP loans that meet SBA requirements may be forgiven in certain circumstances, are fully guaranteed by the SBA, have an initial term of up to five years and earn interest at rate of 1%. The Bank continues to expect a significant portion of these loans will ultimately be forgiven by the SBA in accordance with the terms of the program. Over the course of the PPP, the Bank originated a total of 5,340 PPP loans in the amount of $261.4 million. As of December 31, 2022, the Bank had 71 PPP loans outstanding totaling $20.0 million, or 1.3% of total loans. As of December 31, 2022, these loans had resulted in $11.7 million in deferred loan fees to be recognized over the life of the respective loans. Of this amount, $11.6 million has been recognized as processing fee income and $0.1 million remains to be recognized over the remaining life of the respective loans. Consumer Loans. Consumer loans generally have higher interest rates than mortgage loans. The risk involved in consumer loans fluctuates based on the type and nature of the collateral and, in certain cases, the absence of collateral. Consumer loans include passbook loans and other secured and unsecured loans that have been made for a variety of consumer purposes. As of December 31, 2022, there were $19.1 million, or 1.3% of total loans, in unsecured consumer loans, of which $18.2 million comprised of 27,886 individual loans were outstanding and are held by the Bank pursuant to its arrangement with Grain. In addition, there were $0.5 million in loans with passbook collateral. 8 Loan Originations, Purchases and Sales .

The Bank’s total loans or extensions of credit to a single borrower or group of related borrowers cannot exceed, with specified exemptions, 15% of its total regulatory capital. The Bank’s lending limit as of December 31, 2022 was $71.5 million, with the ability to lend additional amounts up to 10% if the loans or extensions of credit are fully secured by readily-marketable collateral. At December 31, 2022, the Bank complied with these loans-to-one borrower limitations. At December 31, 2022, the Bank’s largest aggregate exposure to one borrower was $44.0 million with an outstanding balance of $8.5 million. The second and third largest exposures were $35.0 million and $28.0 million with outstanding balances of $10.3 million and $0.9 million, respectively. No other loan or loans-to-one borrower, individually or cumulatively, exceeded $25.0 million, or 35.0% of the lending limit. 10 The Bank’s real estate lending is subject to written policies, underwriting standards and operating procedures. Decisions on loan requests are made on the basis of detailed applications submitted by the prospective borrower, credit histories that the Bank obtains and property valuations, consistent with the appraisal policy. The appraisals are prepared by outside independent licensed appraisers and reviewed by third parties, all approved by the Board of Directors. The Loan Committee usually reviews appraisals in considering a loan application. The performance of the appraisers is also subject to internal evaluations using scorecards and are assessed periodically. The loan applications are designed primarily to determine the borrower’s ability to repay the requested loan, and all information provided with the application and checklists provided as part of the application package are evaluated by the loan underwriting department. The real estate lending approval process starts with the processing of the application package, which is reviewed for completeness and then all necessary agency reports are ordered. Upon initial review and preparation of preliminary documents by the processors in the underwriting department, the file is assigned to an underwriter. The underwriters are responsible for presenting the loan request along with a recommendation, to the Loan Committee, and to the Board of Directors when the credit exposure is greater than the Loan Committee’s authority or there are exceptions to the loan policy. If approved, closed and booked, the loan reviewers then undertake the responsibility of monitoring the credit file for the life of the loan by assessing the borrower’s creditworthiness periodically, given certain criteria and following certain operating procedures. An independent third party also performs loan reviews following similar criteria and scope under the oversight of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The Bank’s non-real estate lending is also subject to written policies, underwriting standards and operating procedures. Decisions on these loans requests are made on the basis of applications submitted by the prospective borrowers credit histories that the Bank obtains where applicable, borrower cash flows, as obtained directly from bank statements and predictive algorithms based on expected cash flows. Certain of these loans maybe wholly or partly collateralized by cash or business assets. Mortgage Loans Held for Sale, at Fair Value. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, Mortgage World loans held for sale, at fair value, was $2.0 million and $15.8 million, respectively, included residential mortgages that were originated in accordance with secondary market pricing and underwriting standards. Mortgage World’s intent was to sell these loans on the secondary market. Delinquencies and Non-Performing Assets Delinquency Procedures. Collection efforts commence the day following the grace period, normally on the 17 th of the month. Those loans that have experienced sporadic late payments over the previous 12 months are reviewed with a greater degree of diligence. Late notices are generated and distributed on the 17 th and 30 th day of the month. The Collection Department pursues collection efforts up until the 90th day past due. At that time, the Bank usually will initiate legal proceedings for collection or foreclosure unless it is in the best interest of the Bank to work further with the borrower to arrange a suitable workout plan. Prior to acquiring property through foreclosure proceedings, the Bank will obtain an updated appraisal to determine the fair market value and proceed with net adjustments according to accounting principles. Board of Directors approval is required to pursue a foreclosure. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Bank collected $0.1 million and $0.1 million, respectively, of interest income on non-accruing troubled debt restructured loans, of which $0.01 million and $0.01 million, respectively, was recognized into income. The remaining interest collected on non-accruing troubled debt restructured loans for these periods was applied as a principal reduction for the remaining life of the loan, or until the loan is deemed performing. 11 Delinquent Loans.

Federal regulations provide for the classification of loans and other assets, such as debt and equity securities, considered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) to be of lesser quality, as “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss.” An asset is considered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. “Substandard” assets include those characterized by the “distinct possibility” that the Bank will sustain “some loss” if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as “doubtful” have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified “substandard,” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make “collection or liquidation in full,” on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, “highly questionable and improbable.” Assets classified as “loss” are those considered “uncollectible” and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss allowance is not warranted. Assets which do not currently expose the Bank to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are designated as “special mention” by our management. Under OCC regulations, when an insured institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, it may establish general allowances in an amount deemed prudent by management to cover probable accrued losses. General allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to cover probable accrued losses associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as “loss,” it is required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of that portion of the asset so classified or to charge-off such amount. An institution’s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the regulatory authorities, which may require the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances. 13 In connection with the filing of the Bank’s periodic reports with the OCC and in accordance with its classification of assets policy, it regularly reviews the loans in its portfolio to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. On the basis of this review of loans, the Bank’s classified and special mention loans at the dates indicated were as follows: At December 31, 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 (in thousands) Classified Loans: Substandard $ 21,499 $ 17,317 $ 20,508 $ 22,787 $ 18,665 Total classified loans 21,499 17,317 20,508 22,787 18,665 Special mention loans 9,735 13,798 19,546 17,355 14,394 Total classified and special mention loans $ 31,234 $ 31,115 $ 40,054 $ 40,142 $ 33,059 Substandard loans increased $4.2 million, or 24.1%, to $21.5 million at December 31, 2022 compared to $17.3 million at December 31, 2021. The increase of substandard loans was primarily attributable to increase of $10.8 million in construction and land loans, offset by decreases of $3.3 million in multifamily loans, $2.2 million in nonresidential loans and $1.1 million in 1-4 family loans. Special mention loans decreased $4.1 million, or 29.4%, to $9.7 million at December 31, 2022 compared to $13.8 million at December 31, 2021. The decrease was primarily attributable to decreases of $6.7 million in construction and land loans and $3.9 million in multifamily loans, offset by an increase of $5.9 in 1-4 family loans and $0.6 million in nonresidential loans. Troubled Debt Restructured Loans. The Bank occasionally modifies loans to help borrowers stay current on their loans and to avoid foreclosure. The Bank considers modifications only after analyzing a borrower’s current repayment capacity, evaluating the strength of any guarantors based on documented current financial information, and assessing the current value of any collateral pledged. The Bank generally does not forgive principal or interest on loans, but may do so if it is in its best interest and increases the likelihood that it can collect the remaining principal balance. The Bank may modify the terms of loans to lower interest rates, which may be at below market rates, to provide for fixed interest rates on loans where fixed rates are otherwise not available, or to provide for interest-only terms. These modifications are made only when there is a reasonable and attainable workout plan that has been agreed to by the borrower and is in the Bank’s best interests. At December 31, 2022, there were 23 loans modified as troubled debt restructured loans totaling $6.6 million. Of these, five troubled debt restructured loans, totaling $2.3 million, were included in non-accrual loans and the remaining 18 troubled debt restructured loans, totaling $4.2 million, had been performing in accordance with their modified terms for a minimum of six months since the date of restructuring and are accruing interest. At December 31, 2021, there were 30 loans modified as troubled debt restructured loans totaling $8.7 million. Of these, six troubled debt restructured loans totaling $2.5 million were included in non-accrual loans and the remaining 24 troubled debt restructured loans, totaling $6.2 million, had been performing in accordance with their modified terms for a minimum of six months since the date of restructuring. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no loans modified to troubled debt restructured. Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses The Bank has approved and maintained an appropriate, systematic and consistently applied process to determine the dollar amounts of the allowance for loan and lease losses (“ALLL”) that is adequate to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio and other held financial instruments. An inherent loss, as defined by U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), and applicable banking regulations, is an unconfirmed loss that probably exists based on the information that is available as of the evaluation date. It is not a loss that may arise from events that might occur as a result of a possible future event. Arriving at an appropriate allowance involves a high degree of management’s judgment, is inevitably imprecise, and results in a range of possible losses. 14 The determination of the dollar amounts of the ALLL is based on management’s current judgments about the credit quality of the loan portfolio taking into consideration all known relevant internal and external factors that affect loan payments at the end of each month. The dollar amounts reported each month for the ALLL are reviewed at least quarterly by the Board of Directors. To ensure that the methodology remains appropriate for the Bank, the Board of Directors periodically has the methodology validated externally and causes revisions to be made when appropriate. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors oversees and monitors the internal controls over the ALLL determination process. The Bank adheres to a safe and sound banking practice by maintaining, analyzing, and supporting an adequate ALLL in accordance with GAAP and supervisory guidance. The Bank’s ALLL methodology consists of a system designed and implemented to estimate loan and lease losses. The Bank’s ALLL methodology incorporates management’s current judgments about the credit quality of the loan and lease portfolio through a disciplined and consistently applied process. The Bank’s loan policy requires the following when the Bank calculates the level of ALLL: Loan pools with similar risk characteristics . Loss histories are the starting point for the calculation of ALLL balances. Loss histories are calculated for each of the pools by aggregating the historical losses less recoveries within the respective pools and annualizing the number over the determined length of time. The length of time may vary according to the relevance of past periods’ experience to the current period, among other considerations. The Bank currently uses a prior twelve quarter rolling average for its historical loss rates. Each pool’s historical loss rate is adjusted for the effects of the qualitative or environmental factors. The factors analyzed include: 15 The Bank utilizes a risk-based approach to determine the appropriate adjustments for each qualitative factor. A matrix containing definitions of low, medium, and high-risk levels is used to assess the individual factors to determine their respective directional characteristics. These risk levels serve as the foundation for determining the individual adjustments for each factor for each pool of loans. The qualitative factor adjustments are supported by applicable reports, graphs, articles and any other relevant information to evidence and document management’s judgment as to the respective levels of risk and adjustment requirements. Each of the qualitative adjustment factors is applied to each of the loan pools to reflect adjustments that increase or decrease the historical loss rates applied to each loan pool. Each of these adjustment factors is individually supported and justified, and a discrete narrative for each loan pool reflects current information, events, circumstances and conditions influencing the adjustment. The narratives include descriptions of each factor, management’s analysis of how each factor has changed over time, which loan pool’s loss rates have been adjusted, the amount by which loss estimates have been adjusted for changes in conditions, an explanation of how management estimated the impact, and other available data that support the reasonableness of the adjustments. Once these qualitative adjustment factors are determined for each pool of loans, they are added to the historical loss numbers for each corresponding pool of loans to arrive at a loss factor for each pool based on historical loss experience and qualitative or environmental influences. These loss factors are adjusted to appropriately reflect the respective risk rating categories within each pool by applying the weighting factors described above to those loans within the respective pool’s risk rates. The series of calculations described above can be expressed as the following equation: [(H*P) + (Q*P)] = R, where H = Historical loss factor for the pool Q = Qualitative/Environmental aggregate adjustment for the pool P = Total loans within the pool R = Required reserve amount for the risk rating category within the pool Specific allowances for identified problem loans . The Bank considers a loan to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. All troubled debt restructured loans and loans on non-accrual status are deemed to be impaired. A specific valuation allowance is established for the impairment amount of each loan, calculated using the present value of expected cash flows, observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral, in accordance with the most likely means of recovery. 16 Factors evaluated in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. The Bank determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower’s prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. An unallocated component may be maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect our estimate of probable losses. The unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating allocated and general reserves in the portfolio. Validation of the ALLL . The Bank considers its ALLL methodology valid when it accurately estimates the amount of probable loss contained in the loan portfolio. The Bank has employed procedures, including the following, when validating the reasonableness of its ALLL methodology and determining whether there may be deficiencies in its overall methodology or loan grading process: The Bank supports the independent validation process with the work papers from the ALLL review function and may include the summary findings of an independent reviewer. The Board reviews the findings and acknowledges its review in the minutes of its meeting. If the methodology is changed based upon the findings of the validation process, the documentation that describes and supports the changes is maintained. As an integral part of its examination process, the OCC will periodically review the Bank’s allowance for loan losses. Following such review, the Bank may determine that it is appropriate to recognize additions to the allowance based on its judgment and information available to it at the time of such examination. Current expected credit losses. On June 16, 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard Update 2016-13 , Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments , the current expected credit losses (“CECL”) standard. In October 2019, the FASB voted to defer implementation of the standard for non-public business entities and smaller reporting companies, such as the Company, to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. In response to the new model, the Bank has reassessed its risk management policies and procedures in order for it to successfully implement CECL. The Company has evaluated the amended guidance including the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements. As a result of the required change in approach toward determining estimated credit losses from the current “incurred loss” model to one based on estimated cash flows over a loan’s contractual life, adjusted for prepayments (a “life of loan” model), the Company expects that the new guidance might result in a decrease in the allowance for loan losses, particularly for longer duration loan portfolios. The project team meets on a regular basis to determine the approach for implementation. This includes assessing the adequacy of existing loan and loss data, assessing models for default and loss estimates, conducting limited trial runs and analytical review through December 31, 2022, and to complete independent model valuation and documentation of processes and controls in the first quarter of 2023. Upon adoption, the Company anticipates that it would decrease the allowance to approximately $31.5 million for the loan portfolio and add a $0.7 million allowance for the held-to-maturity securities portfolio. 17 The following table sets forth activity in the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated. For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 (Dollars in thousands) Allowance at beginning of year $ 16,352 $ 14,870 $ 12,329 $ 12,659 $ 11,071 Provision (recovery) for loan losses 24,046 2,717 2,443 258 1,249 Charge-offs: Mortgage loans: 1-4 family residential Investor-owned — — — (8 ) — Owner-occupied — — — — — Multifamily residential — (38 ) — — — Nonresidential properties — — — — — Construction and land — — — — — Nonmortgage loans: Business — — — (724 ) (34 ) Consumer (1) (6,659 ) (1,342 ) (6 ) — (14 ) Total charge-offs (6,659 ) (1,380 ) (6 ) (732 ) (48 ) Recoveries: Mortgage loans: 1-4 family residential Investor-owned 156 8 — 23 1 Owner-occupied 39 45 — — 250 Multifamily residential — — — — — Nonresidential properties — — 4 9 9 Construction and land — — — — — Nonmortgage loans: Business 94 84 95 110 122 Consumer (1) 564 8 5 2 5 Total recoveries 853 145 104 144 387 Net recoveries (charge-offs) (5,806 ) (1,235 ) 98 (588 ) 339 Allowance at end of year $ 34,592 $ 16,352 $ 14,870 $ 12,329 $ 12,659 Allowance for loan losses as a percentage for nonperforming loans 252.33 % 142.90 % 127.28 % 106.30 % 186.77 % Allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans 2.27 % 1.24 % 1.27 % 1.28 % 1.36 % Net recoveries (charge-offs) to average loans outstanding during the year (0.42 %) (0.09 %) 0.01 % (0.06 %) 0.04 % 18 Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses . The following table sets forth the allowance for loan and lease losses by loan category and the percent of the allowance in each category to the total allowance at the dates indicated. The allowance for loan and lease losses of each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses in any particular category and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in other categories.

The allowance for loan and lease losses increased to $34.6 million at December 31, 2022 from $16.4 million at December 31, 2021, of which $15.4 million related to Grain. There were $5.8 million and $1.2 million in net charge-offs during the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 19 Although the Bank believes that it uses the best information available to establish the ALLL, future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary and results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations. Furthermore, although the Bank believes that it has established the ALLL in conformity with GAAP, after a review of the loan portfolio by regulators, the Bank may determine it is appropriate to increase the ALLL. In addition, because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, the existing ALLL may not be adequate and increases may be necessary should the quality of any loan or lease deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above. Any material increase in the ALLL may adversely affect the Bank’s financial condition and results of operations. Investment Activities General . The Bank’s investment policy was adopted and is reviewed annually by the Board of Directors. The Chief Financial Officer (designated as the Chief Investment Officer) will plan and execute investment strategies consistent with the policies approved by the Board of Directors. The Chief Financial Officer provides an investment schedule detailing the investment portfolio which is reviewed at least quarterly by the Bank’s asset-liability committee and the Board of Directors. The current investment policy permits, with certain limitations, investments in United States Treasury securities; securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies or government-sponsored enterprises including mortgage-backed and collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMO”) issued by Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae and Freddie Mac; and corporate bonds and obligations, and certificates of deposit in other financial institutions. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the investment portfolio consisted of available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities and obligations issued by the U.S. government and government-sponsored enterprises, corporate bonds and the FHLBNY stock. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Bank owned $24.7 million and $6.0 million, respectively, of FHLBNY stock. As a member of FHLBNY, the Bank is required to purchase stock from the FHLBNY which is carried at cost and classified as restricted equity securities. Securities Portfolio Composition . The following table sets forth the amortized cost and estimated fair value of the available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities portfolios at the dates indicated, which consisted of U.S. government and federal agencies, corporate bonds, pass-through mortgage-backed securities and certificates of deposit.

At December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no securities of which the amortized cost or estimated value exceeded 10% of total equity . Mortgage-Backed Securities . At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Bank had mortgage-backed securities with a carrying value of $516.5 million and $91.9 million, respectively. Mortgage-backed securities are securities issued in the secondary market that are collateralized by pools of mortgages. Certain types of mortgage-backed securities are commonly referred to as “pass through” certificates because the underlying loans are “passed through” to investors, net of certain costs, including servicing and guarantee fees. Mortgage-backed securities typically are collateralized by pools of one-to-four family residential or multifamily residential mortgages, although the Bank invests primarily in mortgage-backed securities backed by one-to-four family residential mortgages. The issuers of such securities sell the participation interests to investors such as the Bank. The interest rate of the security is lower than the interest rates of the underlying loans to allow for payment of servicing and guaranty fees. All of the Bank’s mortgage-backed securities are backed by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, which are government-sponsored enterprises, or Ginnie Mae, which is a government-owned enterprise. Residential mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises are more liquid than individual mortgage loans because there is an active trading market for such securities. In addition, residential mortgage-backed securities may be used to collateralize borrowings. Investments in residential mortgage-backed securities involve a risk that actual payments will be greater or less than the prepayment rate estimated at the time of purchase, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such interests, thereby affecting the net yield on the securities. Current prepayment speeds determine whether prepayment estimates require modification that could cause amortization or accretion adjustments. Portfolio Maturities and Yields . The composition and maturities of the investment securities portfolio at December 31, 2022 are summarized in the following table. Maturities are based on the final contractual payment dates, and do not reflect the effect of scheduled principal repayments, prepayments, or early redemptions that may occur. Adjustable-rate mortgage-backed securities are included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust.

Deposits have traditionally been the Bank’s primary source of funds for use in lending and investment activities. The Bank receives funds from large deposits made from corporations, nonprofits, and large banks. The Bank also uses borrowings, primarily from the FHLBNY, brokered and listing service deposits, and unsecured lines of credit with correspondent banks, to supplement cash flow needs, lengthen the maturities of liabilities for interest rate risk and manage the cost of funds. In addition, the Bank receives funds from scheduled loan payments, investment principal and interest payments, maturities and calls, loan prepayments and income on earning assets. Although scheduled loan payments and income on earning assets are relatively stable sources of funds, deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates, market conditions and levels of competition. Deposits . Deposits are generated primarily from the Bank’s primary market area. The Bank offers a selection of deposit accounts, including demand accounts, NOW/IOLA accounts, money market accounts, reciprocal deposits, savings accounts and certificates of deposit to individuals, business entities, non-profit organizations and individual retirement accounts. Deposit account terms vary, with the primary differences being the minimum balance required, the amount of time the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate. Interest rates paid, maturity terms, service fees and premature withdrawal penalties are established on a periodic basis. Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on current operating strategies and market rates, liquidity requirements, rates paid by competitors and growth goals. The Bank relies upon personalized customer service, long-standing relationships with customers and the favorable image of the Bank in the community to attract and retain deposits. The Bank also provides a fully functional electronic banking platform, including mobile applications, remote deposit capture and online bill pay, among others, as a service to retail and business customers. The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in money market and other prevailing interest rates and competition. The ability to attract and maintain these and other interest-bearing deposits, and the rates paid on them, have been, and will continue to be, significantly affected by competition and economic and market conditions. The following table sets forth the average balance and weighted average rate of deposits for the periods indicated.

At December 31, 2022, passbook savings accounts and certificates of deposit with a passbook feature totaled $130.0 million, reflecting depositors’ preference for traditional banking services. Borrowings . The Bank may obtain advances from the FHLBNY by pledging as security its capital stock at the FHLBNY and certain of its mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities. Such advances may be made pursuant to several different credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities. To the extent such borrowings have different terms to repricing than the Bank’s deposits, they can change the Bank’s interest rate risk profile. At December 31, 2022 and 2021 the Bank had $517.4 million and $106.3 million of outstanding FHLBNY advances, respectively. Additionally, the Bank has two unsecured lines of credit in the amount of $90.0 million and $25.0 million with two correspondent banks, under which there was nothing outstanding at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Bank also had a guarantee from the FHLBNY through letters of credit in an amount of up to $21.5 million each at December 31, 2022 and 2021. Warehouse Line of Credit . Mortgage World had maintained two warehouse lines of credit with financial institutions for the purpose of funding the originations and sale of residential mortgages. One of the warehouse line of credit had an unused line of credit of 10.0 million at December 31, 2022 and was terminated on February 7, 2023. The other warehouse line of credit was terminated on March 31, 2022. These loans are now funded by the Bank. 23 The following table sets forth information concerning balances and interest rates on borrowings at the dates and for the periods indicated. At or For the Years December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (Dollars in thousands) FHLBNY Advances: Balance outstanding at end of period $ 517,375 $ 106,255 $ 117,255 Average amount outstanding during the period 206,969 108,005 116,947 Maximum outstanding at any month-end during the period 517,375 109,255 152,284 Weighted average interest rate during the period 3.00 % 2.02 % 2.03 % Weighted average interest rate at the end of the period 3.90 % 2.02 % 1.90 % Warehouse Lines of Credit: Balance outstanding at end of period $ — $ 15,090 $ 29,961 Average amount outstanding during the period — 11,675 8,461 Maximum outstanding at any month-end during the period — 16,385 29,961 Weighted average interest rate during the period — 3.29 % 3.34 % Weighted average interest rate at the end of the period — 3.21 % 3.37 % Subsidiaries At December 31, 2022, the Company had one operating subsidiary, Ponce Bank, and Ponce Bank had one subsidiary, Ponce de Leon Mortgage Corp., a New York State chartered mortgage brokerage entity, whose employees are registered in New York and New Jersey. Ponce Bank had another subsidiary, PFS Services, Corp., which was merged into Ponce de Leon Mortgage Corp. on December 31, 2021. Regulation and Supervision General As a federally-chartered, stock savings association, the Bank is subject to examination, supervision and regulation, primarily by the OCC, and, secondarily, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) as the insurer of deposits. The federal system of regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which the Bank is engaging and is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund. The Bank is regulated to a lesser extent by the Federal Reserve Board which governs the reserves to be maintained against deposits and other matters. In addition, the Bank is a member of and owns stock in the FHLBNY, which is one of the 11 regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank’s relationship with its depositors and borrowers is also regulated, to a great extent, by federal law and, to a lesser extent, state law, including in matters concerning the ownership of deposit accounts and the form and content of loan documents. As a savings and loan holding company, the Company is subject to examination and supervision by, and is required to file certain reports with, the Federal Reserve Board. The Company is subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC under the federal securities laws. Mortgage World was a mortgage banking entity which primarily operated in the New York City metropolitan area. It was a Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”) approved Title II lender. To maintain its license, Mortgage World needed to comply with certain regulations set forth by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”). Mortgage World was subject to the comprehensive regulation and examination of the New York State Department of Financial Services (""NYDFS""). The business operated by Mortgage World was integrated as a division of Ponce Bank effective January 26, 2022, and ceased to be separately regulated as a mortgage banking entity by the NYDFS at that time. Mortgage World ceased to conduct business as a separate entity and is now operated as a division of the Bank. Set forth below are certain material regulatory requirements that are applicable to the Company and the Bank. This description of statutes and regulations is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on the Company and the Bank. Any change in these laws or regulations, whether by Congress or the applicable regulatory agencies, could have a material adverse impact on the Company and the Bank and their respective operations. 24 CARES Act In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the CARES Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020. Among other things, the CARES Act includes provisions impacting financial institutions like the Bank. The CARES Act allowed banks to elect to suspend requirements under GAAP for loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic (for loans that were not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019) that would otherwise be categorized as a TDR, including impairment for accounting purposes, until the earlier of 60 days after the termination date of the national emergency or December 31, 2020. This relief was extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act enacted on December 27, 2020 to the earlier of January 1, 2022 or 60 days after the termination of the national emergency. This relief was not extended beyond January 1, 2022 and the Bank has made appropriate adjustments which are not material. Federal banking agencies were required to defer to the determination of the banks making such suspension. The CARES Act created the PPP. The PPP authorized small business loans to pay payroll and group health costs, salaries and commissions, mortgage and rent payments, utilities, and interest on certain debt. The loans were provided through participating financial institutions, such as Bank, that processed loan applications and service the loans. The CARES Act appropriated $349.0 billion for PPP loans. On April 24, 2020, the PPP received another $310.0 billion in funding. On December 27, 2020, the Economic Aid Act appropriated another $284.0 billion for both first and second draw of PPP loans bringing the total appropriations for PPP loans to $943.0 billion. Loans under the PPP that meet SBA requirements may be forgiven in certain circumstances, and are 100% guaranteed by the SBA. The authorization for making PPP loans expired on May 31, 2021. Federal Bank Regulations Business Activities . A federal savings association derives its lending and investment powers from the Home Owners’ Loan Act, as amended, and applicable federal regulations. Under these laws and regulations, the Bank may invest in mortgage loans secured by residential and commercial real estate, commercial business and consumer loans, certain types of debt securities and certain other assets, subject to applicable limits. The Bank may also establish, subject to specified investment limits, service corporation subsidiaries that may engage in certain activities not otherwise permissible for Ponce Bank, including real estate investment and securities and insurance brokerage. Examinations and Assessments . The Bank is primarily supervised by the OCC. The Bank is required to file reports with and is subject to periodic examination by the OCC. The Bank is required to pay assessments to the OCC to fund the agency’s operations. The Company is required to file reports with and is subject to periodic examination by the Federal Reserve Board. It is also required to pay assessments to the Federal Reserve Board to fund the agency’s operations. Capital Requirements . Federal regulations require FDIC-insured depository institutions, including federal savings associations, to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio, a total capital to risk-based assets and a Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. The existing capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015 and are the result of a final rule implementing regulatory amendments based on recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”). The capital standards require the maintenance of common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, 6.0% and 8.0%, respectively. The regulations also establish a minimum required leverage ratio of at least 4.0% Tier 1 capital. Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders’ equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and Additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital generally includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus Additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. In 2015, Ponce De Leon Federal Bank, the predecessor of Ponce Bank, made a one-time, permanent election to opt-out regarding the treatment of AOCI. Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale-securities). Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, an institution’s assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests), are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risk deemed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0.0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, 25 a risk weight of 50.0% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one-to-four family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100.0% is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150.0% is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0.0% to 600.0% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors. In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement is 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Bank’s capital exceeded all applicable requirements. See Note 15, “Regulatory Capital Requirements” of the Notes to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Loans-to-One Borrower . Generally, a federal savings association may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15.0% of unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be lent, equal to 10.0% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if secured by “readily marketable collateral,” which generally includes certain financial instruments (but not real estate). As of December 31, 2022, the Bank was in compliance with the loans-to-one borrower limitations. Standards for Safety and Soundness . Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository institutions. These standards relate to, among other things, internal controls, information systems, audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. Interagency pronouncements set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the pronouncements, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. Failure to implement such a plan can result in further enforcement action, including the issuance of a cease and desist order or the imposition of civil money penalties. Prompt Corrective Action Regulations . Under the Federal Prompt Corrective Action statute, the OCC is required to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions under its jurisdiction, the severity of which depends upon the institution’s level of capital. A savings institution that has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5% or a leverage ratio of less than 4.0% is considered to be “undercapitalized.” A savings institution that has total risk-based capital of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0% or a leverage ratio that is less than 3.0% is considered to be “significantly undercapitalized.” A savings institution that has a tangible capital to assets ratio equal to or less than 2.0% is deemed to be “critically undercapitalized.” Generally, the OCC is required to appoint a receiver or conservator for a federal savings association that becomes “critically undercapitalized” within specific time frames. The regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the OCC within 45 days of the date that a federal savings association is deemed to have received notice that it is “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” Any holding company of a federal savings association that is required to submit a capital restoration plan must guarantee performance under the plan in an amount of up to the lesser of 5.0% of the savings association’s assets at the time it was deemed to be undercapitalized by the OCC or the amount necessary to restore the savings association to adequately capitalized status. This guarantee remains in place until the OCC notifies the savings association that it has maintained adequately capitalized status for each of four consecutive calendar quarters. Institutions that are undercapitalized become subject to certain mandatory measures such as restrictions on capital distributions and asset growth. The OCC may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against undercapitalized federal savings associations, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors. At December 31, 2022, the Bank met the criteria for being considered “well capitalized,” which means that its total risk-based capital ratio exceeded 10.0%, its Tier 1 risk-based ratio exceeded 8.0%, its common equity Tier 1 ratio exceeded 6.5% and its leverage ratio exceeded 5.0%. Qualified Thrift Lender Test . As a federal savings association, the Bank must satisfy the qualified thrift lender, or “QTL,” test. Under the QTL test, the Bank must maintain at least 65% of its “portfolio assets” in “qualified thrift investments” (primarily residential mortgages and related investments, including mortgage-backed securities) in at least nine months of every 12-month period. “Portfolio assets” generally means total assets of a savings association, less the sum of specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, and the value of property used in the conduct of the savings association’s business. Alternatively, the Bank may satisfy the QTL test by qualifying as a “domestic building and loan association” as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. 26 A savings association that fails the qualified thrift lender test must operate under specified restrictions set forth in the Home Owners’ Loan Act. The Dodd-Frank Act made noncompliance with the QTL test subject to agency enforcement action for a violation of law. At December 31, 2022, the Bank satisfied the QTL test. Capital Distributions . Federal regulations govern capital distributions by a federal savings association, which include cash dividends, stock repurchases and other transactions charged to the savings association’s capital account. A federal savings association must file an application with the OCC for approval of a capital distribution if: Even if an application is not otherwise required, every savings association that is a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, such as the Bank, must file a notice with the Federal Reserve Board at least 30 days before its board of directors declares a dividend. An application or notice related to a capital distribution may be disapproved if: In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that an insured depository institution shall not make any capital distribution if, after making such distribution, the institution would fail to meet any applicable regulatory capital requirement. A federal savings association also may not make a capital distribution that would reduce its regulatory capital below the amount required for the liquidation account established in connection with its conversion to stock form. Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws . All federal savings associations have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low and moderate-income borrowers. In connection with its examination of a federal savings association, the OCC is required to assess the federal savings association’s record of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. A savings association’s failure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in denial of certain corporate applications, such as branches or mergers, or in restrictions on its activities. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. The failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the OCC, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice. The Community Reinvestment Act requires all institutions insured by the FDIC to publicly disclose their rating. Ponce Bank, received a “satisfactory” Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recent federal examination. Transactions with Related Parties . As a federal savings association, the Bank’s authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates is limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and federal regulation. An affiliate is generally a company that controls, or is under common control with an insured depository institution such as the Bank. The Company is an affiliate of the Bank because of its control of the Bank. In general, transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates are subject to certain quantitative limits and collateral requirements. In addition, federal regulations prohibit a savings association from lending to any of its affiliates that are engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and from purchasing the securities of any affiliate, other than a subsidiary. Finally, transactions with affiliates must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices, not involve the purchase of low-quality assets and be on terms that are as favorable to the institution as comparable transactions with non-affiliates. The Bank’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10.0% stockholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is currently governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board. Among other things, these provisions generally require that extensions of credit to insiders: 27 In addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by the Bank’s Board of Directors. Extensions of credit to executive officers are subject to additional limits based on the type of extension involved. Enforcement . The OCC has primary enforcement responsibility over federal savings associations and has authority to bring enforcement action against all “institution-affiliated parties,” including directors, officers, stockholders, attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on a federal savings association. Formal enforcement action by the OCC may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers and/or directors of the institution and to the appointment of a receiver or conservator. Civil money penalties (“CMP”) cover a wide range of violations and actions. CMPs are classified into three tiers based on the actionable conduct and the level of culpability. The law sets maximum amounts that the OCC may assess for each day the actionable conduct continues. The FDIC also has the authority to terminate deposit insurance or recommend to the OCC that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular federal savings association. If such action is not taken, the FDIC has authority to take the action under specified circumstances. Insurance of Deposit Accounts . The Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC insures deposits at FDIC insured financial institutions such as the Bank. Deposit accounts in the Bank are insured by the FDIC generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor and up to a maximum of $250,000 for self-directed retirement accounts. The FDIC charges insured depository institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund. The Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to base its assessments upon each insured institution’s total assets less tangible equity. The FDIC has set the assessment range at 1.5 to 40 basis points of total assets less tangible equity. Assessments for most institutions are based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the probability of failure within three years. The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. Management cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future. Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We do not currently know of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of the Bank’s deposit insurance. Federal Reserve System Generally, Federal Reserve Board regulations require depository institutions to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and regular checking accounts). In an effort to respond to the negative effects on the economy from the COVID-19 pandemic, effective March 26, 2020, the Federal Reserve Board eliminated the reserve requirement for depository institutions in order to support lending to households and businesses. Federal Home Loan Bank System The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank System provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions as well as other entities involved in home mortgage lending. As a member of the FHLBNY, the Bank is required to acquire and hold shares of the capital stock of the FHLBNY. As of December 31, 2022, the Bank was in compliance with this requirement. The Bank may also utilize advances from the FHLBNY as a source of investable funds. Other Regulations Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by the Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. The Bank’s operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the: 28 The operations of the Bank are subject to the: Holding Company Regulations General . The Company is a unitary savings and loan holding company within the meaning of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. As such, the Company is registered with the Federal Reserve Board and are subject to the regulation, examination, supervision and reporting requirements applicable to savings and loan holding companies. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over the Company and its non-savings association subsidiaries, if any. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities of those entities that are determined to be a serious risk to the subsidiary savings institution. Permissible Activities . Under present law, the business activities of the Company are generally limited to those activities permissible for financial holding companies under Section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, provided certain conditions are met and financial holding company status is elected, or for multiple savings and loan holding companies. A financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature, including underwriting equity securities and insurance, 29 as well as activities that are incidental to financial activities or complementary to a financial activity. A multiple savings and loan holding company is generally limited to activities permissible for bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act, subject to regulatory approval, and certain additional activities authorized by federal regulations. The Company’s predecessor was designated as a financial holding company. The Company anticipates that it will elect financial holding company status and request Federal Reserve Board notification of effectiveness. Federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company, including the Company, directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries, from acquiring more than 5.0% (“control”) of another savings institution or savings and loan holding company, without prior Federal Reserve Board approval. The Federal Reserve Board adopted a final rule on January 30, 2020, effective April 1, 2020, providing further guidance regarding under what circumstances “control” will be found to exist. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings institutions, the Federal Reserve Board considers factors such as the financial and managerial resources, future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors. The Federal Reserve Board is prohibited from approving any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings institutions in more than one state, subject to two exceptions: Capital. Savings and loan holding companies had historically not been subjected to consolidated regulatory capital requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to establish minimum consolidated capital requirements that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries. However, pursuant to legislation passed in December 2014, the Federal Reserve Board extended to savings and loan holding companies the applicability of its “Small Bank Holding Company” exception to its consolidated capital requirements and, pursuant to a law enacted in May 2018, increased the threshold for the exception to $3.0 billion. As a result, savings and loan holding companies with less than $3.0 billion in consolidated assets, such as the Company, are generally not subject to the capital requirements unless otherwise advised by the Federal Reserve Board. Source of Strength. The Dodd-Frank Act extended the “source of strength” doctrine to savings and loan holding companies. The Federal Reserve Board has issued regulations requiring that all savings and loan holding companies serve as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions. Dividends and Stock Repurchases . The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall supervisory financial condition. Separate regulatory guidance provides for prior consultation with Federal Reserve Bank staff concerning dividends in certain circumstances such as where the company’s net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company’s overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company’s capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a savings and loan holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary savings association becomes undercapitalized. The regulatory guidance also states that a savings and loan holding company should inform Federal Reserve Bank supervisory staff prior to redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock if the savings and loan holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or the repurchase or redemption would result in a net reduction, at the end of a quarter, in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. These regulatory policies may affect the ability of the Company to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions. Acquisition. Under the Federal Change in Bank Control Act, a notice must be submitted to the Federal Reserve Board if any person (including a company), or group acting in concert, seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of a savings and loan holding company. Under certain circumstances, a change of control may occur, and prior notice is required, upon the acquisition of 10% or more of the company’s outstanding voting stock, unless the Federal Reserve Board has found that the acquisition will not result in control of the company. A change in control definitively occurs upon the acquisition of 25% or more of the company’s outstanding voting stock. Under the Change in Bank Control Act, the Federal Reserve Board generally has 60 days from the filing of a complete notice to act, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition. The Federal Reserve Board adopted a final rule on January 30, 2020, effective April 1, 2020, providing further guidance regarding under what circumstances “control” will be found to exist. 30 Federal Securities Laws The Company’s common stock is registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”). The Company is subject to the public disclosure, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Exchange Act. Securities and Exchange Commission Proposal On March 21, 2022, the SEC proposed new ‎rules (the ""Proposal"") that, if finalized, will require reporting companies, such as the Company, to disclose ‎climate-related risks, metrics, and other information in their audited financial ‎statements, registration statements, annual reports (such as Form 10-K) and other ‎SEC filings. The Proposal builds upon earlier SEC climate risk disclosure guidance and in many ‎ways draws upon recommendations by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial ‎Disclosures, as well as accounting and reporting standards from the ‎Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Through these approaches, the SEC says it is seeking to ‎provide a ""consistent, comparable, and reliable"" structure for the measurement, ‎tracking, and reporting of greenhouse gas (""GHG"") risks and emissions. Even for companies ‎currently tracking GHG emissions, it is likely that the Proposal will not only materially ‎increase requirements associated with tracking and quantification of GHGs, but also ‎impose further layers of disclosure obligations. For those companies that do not ‎currently measure, track and report such metrics, the new rules likely will present a ‎significant and potentially costly new disclosure regime that could require major management and reporting changes. For all ‎reporting companies, compliance with the breadth of the Proposal will require significant ‎coordination between a business's operational, financial, and environmental functions.‎ The Proposal establishes different levels of compliance and timing of the effectiveness of compliance for reporting companies. For SEC purposes, the Company is presently a smaller reporting company which would currently give it the more time than larger issuers to comply with the Proposal if it is adopted in its current form. No assurance can be given what, if any, form the final regulation may take. Loss of Emerging Growth Company Status The Company ceased to qualify as an emerging growth company under the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”) effective December 31, 2022. Although the Company is no longer an emerging growth company, so long as it remains a “smaller reporting company” under SEC regulations (public float less than $250 million of voting and non-voting equity held by non-affiliates) and a non-accelerated filer (annual revenues of less than $100 million), it is not subject to the requirement that its auditors attest to the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting and has the right to provide scaled disclosure in its periodic reports and proxy statements with respect to a number of disclosure requirements. Taxation The Company and the Bank are subject to federal and state income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal and state taxation is intended only to summarize material income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Company and the Bank. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company was subject to U.S. federal income tax, New York State income tax, Connecticut income tax, New Jersey income tax, Florida income tax, Pennsylvania income tax and New York City income tax. The Company is generally no longer subject to examination by taxing authorities for years before 2019. Federal Taxation Method of Accounting . For federal income tax purposes, the Bank currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending December 31 for filing its federal income tax returns. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company and the Bank file a consolidated federal income tax return. The Small Business Protection Act of 1996 eliminated the use of the reserve method of accounting for income taxes on bad debt reserves by savings institutions. For taxable years beginning after 1995, Ponce De Leon Federal Bank, the predecessor of Ponce Bank, and Ponce Bank have been subject to the same bad debt reserve rules as commercial banks. The Bank currently utilizes the specific charge-off method under Section 582(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. Net Operating Loss Carryovers . A financial institution may not carry back net operating losses (“NOL”) to earlier tax years. The NOL can be carried forward indefinitely. The use of NOLs to offset income is limited to 80%. The CARES Act allows NOLs generated in 2018, 2019 and 2020 to be carried back to each of the five preceding tax years. The Bank, did not generate NOLs in 2018, 2019 or 2020 so no carryback is available. At December 31, 2022, the Bank has a federal NOL carryforwards of $13.1 million. 31 State Taxation The Company is treated as a financial institution under Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey state income tax law. The states of Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey subject financial institutions to all state and local taxes in the same manner and to the same extent as other business corporations in Connecticut, New York and New Jersey. Additionally, depository financial institutions are subject to local business license taxes and a special occupation tax. Consolidated Group Return . With tax years beginning after January 1, 2015, New York State and New York City require unitary combined reporting for all entities engaged in a unitary business that meet certain ownership requirements. All applicable entities meet the ownership requirements in the Bank filing group and a combined return is appropriately filed. Furthermore, New Jersey changed its tax laws and now requires combined reporting for tax years that end on or after July 31, 2019 for entities that engage in a unitary business. Net Operating Loss Carryovers . The state and city of New York allow for a three-year carryback period and carryforward period of twenty years on net operating losses generated on or after tax year 2015. For tax years prior to 2015, no carryback period is allowed. Ponce De Leon Federal Bank, the predecessor of Ponce Bank, has pre-2015 carryforwards of $0.6 million for New York State purposes and $0.5 million for New York City purposes. Furthermore, there are post-2015 carryforwards available of $60.9 million for New York State purposes and $33.9 million for New York City purposes. Finally, for New Jersey purposes, losses may only be carried forward 20 years, with no allowable carryback period. At December 31, 2022, the Bank has federal net operating loss carryforward of $13.1 million, Connecticut net operation loss carryforward of $0.1 million and New Jersey net operating loss carryforward of $0.5 million. Item 1A. Ris k Factors. Summary Specific risks related to our business include, but are not limited to, those related to: (1) the Russia-Ukraine conflicts; (2) inflationary pressures; (3) our planned increase in multifamily, nonresidential and construction and land lending and the unseasoned nature of these loans; (4) residential property and investor-owned properties; (5) loans that we make through our FinTech partnerships, including Grain; (6) our allowance for loan losses; (7) local and national economic conditions, including conditions specific to the banking industry; (8) environmental liability risks; (9) our SBA PPP lending; (10) our ability to achieve and manage our growth strategy; (11) our minority investments in financial technology related companies; (12) competition within the financial services industry, nationally and within our market area and that our small size makes it more difficult to compete; (13) our implementation of new lines of business or offering new products and services; (14) our reliance on our management team; (15) changes in interest rates and the valuation of securities held by us; (16) changes in and compliance with laws and regulations; (17) operational risks including technology, cybersecurity and reputational risks; (18) changes in accounting standards and in management’s estimates and assumptions; (19) our liquidity management; (20) dilution of our stockholders’ ownership interests from our 2018 Equity Incentive Plan and likely new stock-based benefit plans; (21) societal responses to climate change; and (22) the gentrification of our markets. You should read this entire document carefully, including the Risk Factors below that discusses the above risks in further detail. Risks Related to Russia—Ukraine Conflict. The impact of the military action in Ukraine may affect our business. On February 24, 2022, Russian forces launched significant military action against Ukraine, and sustained conflict and disruption in the region is possible. The impact to Ukraine as well as actions taken by other countries, including new and stricter sanctions imposed by Canada, the United Kingdom, the European Union, the U.S. and other countries and companies and organizations against officials, individuals, regions, and industries in Russia, and actions taken by Russia in response to such sanctions, and each country’s potential response to such sanctions, tensions, and military actions could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We have no way to predict the progress or outcome of the situation, as the conflict and government reactions are rapidly developing and beyond our control. Prolonged unrest, military activities, or broad-based sanctions, could have a material adverse effect on the global, U.S. and local economics. The information contained in this section is accurate as of the date hereof, but may become outdated due to changing circumstances beyond our present awareness or control. 32 Risks Related to our Lending Activities. We have increased our multifamily, nonresidential and construction and land loans, and intend to continue to increase originations of these types of loans. These loans may carry greater credit risk than loans secured by one-to-four family real estate that could adversely affect our financial condition and net income. Our focus is primarily on prudently growing our multifamily, nonresidential and construction and land loan portfolio. At December 31, 2022, $987.7 million, or 64.7%, of our loan portfolio consisted of multifamily, nonresidential and construction and land loans as compared to $722.6 million, or 54.7%, of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2021. Because the repayment of multifamily, nonresidential and construction and land loans depends on the successful management and operation of the borrower’s properties or related businesses, repayment of such loans can be affected by adverse conditions in the local real estate market or economy. A downturn in the real estate market or the local economy could adversely impact the value of properties securing the loan or the revenues from the borrower’s business, thereby increasing the risk of non-performing loans. In addition, many of our commercial real estate loans are not fully amortizing and require large balloon payments upon maturity. Such balloon payments may require the borrower to either sell or refinance the underlying property in order to make the payment, which may increase the risk of default or nonpayment. Further, the physical condition of non-owner occupied properties may be below that of owner occupied properties due to lax property maintenance standards, which have a negative impact on the value of the collateral properties. As our multifamily, nonresidential and construction and land loan portfolios increase, the corresponding risks and potential for losses from these loans may also increase. Given their larger balances and the complexity of the underlying collateral, multifamily, nonresidential and construction and land loans generally expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by one-to-four family real estate. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one-to-four family residential real estate loan. In addition, any adverse developments with respect to borrowers or groups of borrowers that have more than one of these types of loans outstanding can expose us to significantly greater risk of loss compared to borrowers or groups of borrowers that only have one type of these loans. If loans that are collateralized by real estate or other business assets become troubled and the values of the underlying collateral have been significantly impaired, we may not be able to recover the full contractual amounts of principal and interest that we anticipated at the time we originated the loans, which could cause us to increase our provision for loan losses which would, in turn, adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Further, if we foreclose on this type of collateral, our holding period for that collateral may be longer than for one-to-four family real estate loans because there are fewer potential purchasers of that collateral, which can result in substantial holding costs. Some of our borrowers have more than one of these types of loans outstanding. At December 31, 2022, 40,473 loans with an aggregate balance of $1.37 billion are to borrowers with only one loan. Another 190 loans are to borrowers with two loans each with a corresponding aggregate balance of $137.4 million. In addition, there are 7 borrowers with three loans each with a corresponding aggregate balance of $18.3 million and two borrowers with four loans with an aggregate balance of $1.1 million. During periods of slower economic growth or challenging economic periods like those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, small to medium-sized businesses, which make up the majority of our customers, may be impacted more severely and more quickly than larger businesses. Inflationary Pressures and Rising Prices for Goods and Services, Including Energy. Inflation rose sharply at the end of 2022 and has continued rising in 2023 at levels not seen for over 40 years. Inflationary pressures are currently expected to remain elevated throughout 2022. Small to medium-sized businesses may be impacted more during periods of high inflation as they are not as able to leverage economics of scale to mitigate cost pressures compared to larger businesses. Consequently, the ability of many of our business customers to repay their loans may deteriorate, and in some cases this deterioration may occur quickly, which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 33 The unseasoned nature of our multifamily, nonresidential and construction and land loans portfolio may result in changes to our estimates of collectability, which may lead to additional provisions or charge-offs, which could hurt our profits. Our multifamily, nonresidential and construction and land loan portfolio has increased approximately $265.1 million, or 36.7%, to $987.7 million at December 31, 2022 from $722.6 million at December 31, 2021 and increased approximately $90.4 million, or 14.3%, to $722.2 million at December 31, 2021 from $632.2 million at December 31, 2020. A large portion of our multifamily, nonresidential and construction and land loan portfolio is unseasoned and does not provide us with a significant payment or charge-off history pattern from which to judge future collectability. Currently, we estimate potential charge-offs using a rolling 12 quarter average and peer data adjusted for qualitative factors specific to us. As a result, it may be difficult to predict the future performance of this part of our loan portfolio. These loans may have delinquency or charge-off levels above our historical experience or current estimates, which could adversely affect our future performance. Further, these types of loans generally have larger balances and involve a greater risk than one-to-four family owner-occupied residential mortgage loans. Accordingly, if we make any errors in judgment in the collectability of our multifamily, nonresidential and construction and land loans, any resulting charge-offs may be larger on a per loan basis than those incurred historically with our residential mortgage loans. Our business may be adversely affected by credit risk associated with residential property. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, one-to-four family residential real estate loans amounted to $478.8 million and $414.3 million, or 31.4% and 31.3%, respectively, of our total loan portfolio. Of these amounts, $344.0 million and $317.3 million, or 71.8% and 76.6%, respectively, is comprised of one-to-four family residential investor-owned properties. One-to-four family residential mortgage lending, whether owner-occupied or non-owner occupied is generally sensitive to regional and local economic conditions that significantly impact the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations. Declines in real estate values could cause some of our one-to-four family residential mortgages to be inadequately collateralized, which would expose us to a greater risk of loss if we seek to recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral. One-to-four family residential mortgage lending, whether owner-occupied or non-owner-occupied, with higher combined loan-to-value ratios are more sensitive to declining property values than those with lower combined loan-to-value ratios and therefore may experience a higher incidence of default and severity of losses. In addition, if the borrowers sell their properties, they may be unable to repay their loans in full from the sale proceeds. For those home equity loans and lines of credit secured by a second mortgage, it is unlikely that we will be successful in recovering all or a portion of our loan proceeds in the event of default unless we are prepared to repay the first mortgage loan and such repayment and the costs associated with a foreclosure are justified by the value of the property. In addition, the current judicial and legal climate makes it difficult to foreclose on residential properties expeditiously and with reasonable costs. For these reasons, we may experience higher rates of delinquencies, default and losses on our one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. We have made initial and extended forbearances to one-to-four family residential loans as short-term modifications made on a good faith basis in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and in furtherance of governmental policies. We actively monitor borrowers in forbearance and seek to determine their capacity to resume payments as contractually obligated upon the termination of the forbearance period. Loans secured by non-owner occupied properties generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than loans secured by owner occupied properties because repayment of such loans depend primarily on the tenant’s continuing ability to pay rent to the property owner, who is our borrower, or, if the property owner is unable to find a tenant, the property owner’s ability to repay the loan without the benefit of a rental income stream. In addition, the physical condition of non-owner occupied properties is often below that of owner occupied properties due to lax property maintenance standards, which has a negative impact on the value of the collateral properties. 34 The Company’s net income and earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2022 have been adversely affected by a significant write-off and write-down related to its relationship with Grain Technologies, Inc. The Company’s results may be further adversely affected as a result of its lending relationship with Grain. As discussed under Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations‎, Factors Affecting the Comparability of Results, Write-off and Write-Down of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company has taken a significant write-off and write-down related to microloans originated by FinTech startup company Grain as a result of cyber fraud in the application for microloans originated by Grain. Under the terms of its agreement with Grain, if a microloan originated by Grain is found to be fraudulent, becomes 90 days delinquent upon 90 days of origination or defaults due to a failure of ‎Grain to properly service the microloan, the Bank’s applicable standards for origination or servicing are deemed to have not been ‎complied with and the microloan is put back to Grain, who then becomes responsible for the microloan and any related losses. The ‎microloans put back to Grain were accounted for as an “other asset,” specifically referred to herein as the “Grain Receivable.”‎ During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company has assessed ‎the collectability of the remaining Grain Receivable and has determined that it is appropriate to write-off the receivable in its entirety for a total write-off of $16.9 million - $8.0 million during the first quarter, $1.5 million during the second quarter, $7.9 million during the third quarter, offset by a recovery of $0.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2022. Additionally, the Company has written-off its equity investment in Grain of $1.0 million. The Company continues to closely monitor its portfolio of consumer loans originated by Grain as well as Grain’s refinement of ‎solutions for detecting and preventing cyber fraud in the application for microloans. The Company has requested, and Grain has ‎agreed, that no new microloans be originated until further notice and that further extensions of credit to an existing microloan ‎borrower only be made upon confirmation that such borrower is not fraudulent. Further, like other start-up companies, there is a higher level ‎of risk that Grain may not be able to execute its business plan and may fail. In the event Grain were to cease operations, and ‎although it has considered contingency plans, the Bank may have greater difficulty in servicing and collecting the microloan ‎portfolio. In such a case, the level the Bank has provided for in its allowance for loan losses for its microloan portfolio may be ‎inadequate and it may need to increase its provision for loan losses, which could materially decrease the Company’s net income. As a ‎consequence of such events the Bank may determine it appropriate to terminate its relationship with Grain. If our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings and capital could decrease. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, our allowance for loan losses totaled $34.6 million and $16.4 million, which represented 2.27%, and 1.24% of total loans, respectively. Included in the allowance for loan losses were $15.4 million and 1.4 million related to Grain at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for many of our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we review our loans, loss and delinquency experience, and business and commercial real estate peer data, and we evaluate other factors including, but not limited to, current economic conditions. If our assumptions are incorrect, or if delinquencies or non-performing loans increase, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, which would require additions to our allowance, which in turn, could materially decrease our net income. Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, became effective for Ponce Financial and Ponce Bank on January 1, 2023. CECL requires financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans, and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for credit losses. In addition, our regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the allowance for loan losses and, as a result of such reviews, we may determine that it is appropriate to increase the allowance for loan losses by recognizing additional provisions for loan losses charged to income, or to charge off loans, which, net of any recoveries, would decrease the allowance for loan losses. Any such additional provisions for loan losses or charge-offs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. A worsening of economic conditions in our market area could reduce demand for our products and services and/or result in increases in our level of nonperforming loans, which could adversely affect our operations, financial condition and earnings. Although there is not a single employer or industry in our market area on which a significant number of our customers are dependent, a substantial portion of our loan portfolio is composed of loans secured by property located in the greater New York metropolitan area. This can make us vulnerable to a downturn in the local economy and real estate markets. Adverse conditions in the local economy could have a significant impact on the ability of our borrowers to repay loans and the value of the collateral securing their loans, which could adversely impact our net interest income. Any deterioration in economic conditions, such as those that could resulted from the Russia—Ukraine conflict, could have the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations: 35 Moreover, a significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, acts of terrorism, an outbreak of hostilities, including the Russia—Ukraine conflict, a pandemic, or other international or domestic calamities, unemployment or other factors beyond our control could further impact these local economic conditions and could further negatively affect the financial results of our banking operations. In addition, deflationary pressures, while possibly lowering our operating costs, could have a significant negative effect on our borrowers, especially our business borrowers, and the values of underlying collateral securing their loans, which could negatively affect our financial performance. We are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities or properties we own. A significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate, and we could become subject to environmental liabilities with respect to one or more of these properties, or with respect to properties that we own in operating our business. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing defaulted loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous conditions or toxic substances are found on these properties, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage, civil fines and criminal penalties regardless of when the hazardous conditions or toxic substances first affected any particular property. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses to address unknown liabilities and may materially reduce the affected property’s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. Our policies, which require us to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on non-residential real property, may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on us. Loans originated under the SBA Paycheck Protection Program subject us to credit, forgiveness and guarantee risk. We originated 5,340 PPP loans, of which 71 loans totaling $20.0 million were outstanding at December 31, 2022. The PPP loans are subject to the provisions of the CARES Act and to complex rules and guidance issued by the SBA and other government agencies. We expect that the great majority of our remaining PPP borrowers will seek full or partial forgiveness of their loan obligations. We have credit risk on PPP loans if the SBA determines that there is a deficiency in the manner in which we originated, funded or serviced loans, including any issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive a PPP loan. We could face additional risks in our administrative capabilities to service our PPP loans, and risk with respect to the determination of loan forgiveness, depending on the final procedures for determining loan forgiveness. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which we originated, funded or serviced a PPP loan, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty or, if the SBA has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from us. Risks Related to our Business Strategy. Our business strategy includes growth, and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively. Growing our operations could also cause our expenses to increase faster than our revenues. Our business strategy includes growth in assets, loans, deposits and the scale of our operations. Achieving such growth will require us to attract customers that currently bank at other financial institutions in our market area. Our ability to successfully grow will depend on a variety of factors, including our ability to attract and retain experienced bankers, the continued availability of desirable business opportunities, competition from other financial institutions in our market area and our ability to manage our growth. Growth opportunities may not be available or we may not be able to manage our growth successfully. If we do not manage our growth effectively, our financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected. Furthermore, there can be considerable costs involved in expanding deposit and lending capacity that generally require a period of time to generate the necessary revenues to offset their costs, especially in areas in which we do not have an established presence and require alternative delivery methods. Accordingly, any such business expansion can be expected to negatively impact our earnings for some period of time until certain economies of scale are reached. Our expenses could be further increased if we encounter delays in modernizing existing facilities, opening of new branches or deploying new services. We may incur losses due to minority investments in other financial technology related companies. 36 As part of our business strategy, we have made minority investments in technology related companies, and may from time to time make or consider making similar additional investments. At December 31, 2022, the Company had written-off its entire $1.0 million investment in Grain. We may not be able to influence the activities of companies in which we invest and may suffer additional losses in the future due to these activities. New lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks. From time to time, we may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. In addition, we will continue to make investments in research, development, and marketing for new products and services. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services we may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the development and introduction of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. Furthermore, if customers do not perceive our new offerings as providing significant value, they may fail to accept our new products and services. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Furthermore, the burden on management and our information technology of introducing any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our efficiency ratio is high, and we anticipate that it may remain high, as a result of the ongoing implementation of our business strategy. Our non-interest expense totaled $85.8 million and $57.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Although we continue to analyze our expenses and pursue efficiencies where available, our efficiency ratio remains high as a result of the implementation of our business strategy combined with operating in an expensive market. Our efficiency ratio was 117.53% and 61.13% for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Our efficiency ratio for the year ended December 31, 2022 improved compared with prior year due to the inclusion of $17.9 million Grain write-off and write-down of Grain receivable and a $5.0 million of contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation. Our efficiency ratio for the year ended December 31, 2021 improved compared with prior year due to the inclusion of $20.3 million in one-time gains, net of expenses, as a result of the sale and leaseback of real property. If we are unable to successfully implement our business strategy and increase our revenues, our profitability could be adversely affected. We have received an investment under the Emergency Capital Investment Program (“ECIP”) from the U.S. Treasury, in exchange for the issuance of senior perpetual preferred stock, which preferred stock has certain rights and preferences as compared to shares of our common stock. We are subject to certain contractual and regulatory restrictions under the ECIP which may hinder our operations. On June 7, 2022, the Company issued 225,000 shares of the Company’s Preferred Stock‎, par value $0.01 for an aggregate purchase price equal to $225,000,000 in cash to the Treasury, pursuant to the Treasury’s ECIP. Under the ECIP, Treasury provided investment capital directly to depository institutions that are CDFIs or MDIs or their holding companies, to provide loans, grants, and forbearance for small businesses, minority-owned businesses, and consumers, in low-income and underserved communities. No dividends will accrue or be due for the first two years after issuance. For years three through ten, depending upon the level of qualified and/or deep impact lending made in targeted communities, as defined in the ECIP guidelines, dividends will be at an annual rate of either 2.0%, 1.25% or 0.5% and, thereafter, will be fixed at one of the foregoing rates. If we are unable to make qualified and/or deep impact loans at required levels, we will be required to pay dividends at the higher annual rates. Additionally, we may make qualified and/or deep impact loans that are riskier than we otherwise would in an effort to meet the lending requirements for the lower dividend rates. Holders of Preferred Stock generally do not have any voting rights, with the exception of voting rights on certain matters as outlined in the Certificate of Designations. The Treasury is the holder of the Preferred Stock and a governmental entity, and the Treasury may hold interests that are different from a private investor in exercising its voting and other rights. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the Preferred Stock will be entitled to a liquidation preference, subject to certain limitations, in the amount of the sum of $1,000 per share plus declared and unpaid dividends (without accumulation of undeclared dividends) on each share. As a participant in the ECIP, the Company must comply with certain operating requirements. Specifically, the Company must adopt the Treasury's standards for executive compensation and luxury expenses for the period during which the Treasury holds equity issued under the ECIP. These restrictions may make it difficult to adequately compensate our management team, which could impact 37 our ability to retain qualified management. Additionally, under the ECIP regulations, the Company cannot pay dividends or repurchase its common stock unless it meets certain income-based tests and has paid the required dividends on the Preferred Stock. We may be dependent on borrowings from the FHLBNY to grow our lending activities, which may negatively impact our results of operations. In recent periods, we have relied on non-core funding sources, primarily borrowings from the FHLBNY, to fund a portion of our lending activities when we do not have sufficient core deposits. Borrowings from the FHLBNY are generally higher cost as compared to core deposits, which will generally lead to decreases in our net interest margin and lower net revenues. Additionally, the Bank’s FHLBNY membership does not represent a legal commitment to extend credit to the Bank. The amount that the Bank can potentially borrow is currently dependent on the amount of unencumbered eligible securities and loans that the Bank can use as collateral and the collateral margins required by the lenders. The Bank’s borrowing capacity may be adjusted by the FHLBNY and may take into account factors such as the Bank’s tangible common equity ratio, collateral margins required by the lender or other factors. A possible future downgrade of securities and loans pledged as collateral could also impact the amount of available funding. If we are unable to obtain funding through the FHLBNY, we may be forced to seek additional alternative funding sources, which may be higher cost, in order to fund our loan growth. Risks Related to Competitive Matters Strong competition within our market areas may limit our growth and profitability. Competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. In our market area, we compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking firms and unregulated or less regulated non-banking entities, operating locally and elsewhere. Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources and higher lending limits than we have and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. In addition, some of our competitors offer loans with lower interest rates on more attractive terms than loans we offer. Competition also makes it increasingly difficult and costly to attract and retain qualified employees. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area. If we must raise interest rates paid on deposits or lower interest rates charged on our loans, our net interest margin and profitability could be adversely affected. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of new legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Banks, securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and merchant banking. Also, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. Many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can. We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. For additional information see “Business —Market Area and—Competition.” Our small size makes it more difficult for us to compete. Our small asset size makes it more difficult to compete with other financial institutions that are larger and can more easily afford to invest in the marketing and technologies needed to attract and retain customers. Because our principal source of income is the net interest income we earn on our loans and investments after deducting interest paid on deposits and other sources of funds, our ability to generate the revenues needed to cover our expenses and finance such investments is limited by the size of our loan and investment portfolios. Accordingly, we are not always able to offer new products and services as quickly as our competitors. Our lower earnings may also make it more difficult to offer competitive salaries and benefits. In addition, our smaller customer base may make it difficult to generate meaningful non-interest income from such activities as securities and insurance brokerage. Finally, as a smaller institution, we are disproportionately affected by the continually increasing costs of compliance with new banking and other regulations. 38 Risks Related to Our Management. We depend on our management team to implement our business strategy and execute successful operations and we could be harmed by the loss of their services. We are dependent upon the services of the members of our senior management team who direct our strategy and operations. Members of our senior management team, or lending personnel who possess expertise in our markets and key business relationships, could be difficult to replace. Our loss of these persons, or our inability to hire additional qualified personnel, could impact our ability to implement our business strategy and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our ability to compete in our markets. See “Management.” Adherence to our internal policies and procedures by management is critical to our performance and how we are perceived by our regulators. Our internal policies and procedures are a critical component of our corporate governance and, in some cases, compliance with applicable regulations. We adopt internal policies and procedures to guide management and employees regarding the operation and conduct of our business. We may not always achieve absolute compliance with all of our policies and procedures. Any deviation or non-adherence to these internal policies and procedures, whether intentional or unintentional, could have a detrimental effect on our management, operations or financial condition. Risks Related to Interest Rates. Interest rates are rising and expected to continue to rise and the possibility that we may access higher-cost funds to support our loan growth and operations may adversely affect our net interest income and profitability. The Federal Reserve raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4.50%-4.75% during its January 31, 2023 to February 1, 2023 meeting, the eighth consecutive rate hike since March 2022, and increasing borrowing costs. The Federal Reserve has signaled that there will likely be additional federal funds interest rate increases. The recent increase and the anticipated increases are in response to inflation rising at a rate not seen in over 40 years. Because of this rising rate environment, the speed with which it is anticipated to be implemented, the significant competitive pressures in our markets and the potential negative impact of these factors on our deposit and loan pricing, our net interest margin may be negatively impacted. Our net interest income may also be negatively impacted if the demand for loans decreases due to the rate increases, alone or in tandem with the concurrent inflationary pressures. We may be negatively impacted if we are unable to appropriately time adjustments to our funding costs and the rates we earn on our loans. An important component of our ability to mitigate pressures of a rising rate environment will be our ability to prudently increase the rates we pay on deposits, including core deposits. If we were to increase these rates, because of competitive pricing pressures in our markets, liquidity purposes or otherwise, our net interest margin may be negatively impacted. In addition, as our growth in earning assets has outpaced growth in our core deposits in recent quarters, we have had to increase our reliance on noncore funding. These funding sources may be more rate sensitive than our core depositors, and, accordingly, we may be compelled to increase the rates we pay on these funds which may limit our ability to maintain on-balance sheet liquidity levels consistent with our policies, which would negatively impact our net interest margin. We seek to limit the amount of non-core funding we utilize to support our growth. If we are unable to grow our core funding at rates that are sufficient to match or exceed our loan growth we may be required to slow our loan growth. As interest rates change, we expect that we will periodically experience “gaps” in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities, meaning that either our interest-bearing liabilities (usually deposits and borrowings) will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest-earning assets (usually loans and investment securities), or vice versa. In either event, if market interest rates should move contrary to our position, this “gap” may work against us, and our results of operations and financial condition may be negatively affected. We attempt to manage our risk from changes in market interest rates by adjusting the rates, maturity, repricing characteristics, and balances of the different types of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Interest rate risk management techniques are not exact. From time to time, we reposition a portion of our investment securities portfolio in an effort to better position our balance sheet for potential changes in short-term rates. We employ the use of models and modeling techniques to quantify the levels of risks to net interest income, which inherently involve the use of assumptions, judgments, and estimates. While we strive to ensure the accuracy of our modeled interest rate risk profile, there are inherent limitations and imprecisions in this determination and actual results may differ. 39 Future changes in interest rates could reduce our profits and asset values. Net income (loss) is the amount by which net interest income and non-interest income exceeds (or does not exceed) non-interest expense and the provisions for loan losses and taxes. Net interest income makes up a majority of our income and is based on the difference between: The rates we earn on our assets and the rates we pay on our liabilities are generally fixed for a contractual period of time. Like many savings institutions, our liabilities generally have shorter contractual maturities than our assets. This imbalance can create significant earnings volatility because market interest rates change over time. In a period of rising interest rates, the interest income we earn on our assets may not increase as rapidly as the interest we pay on our liabilities as the demand for loans may decrease materially. In a period of declining interest rates, the interest income we earn on our assets may decrease more rapidly than the interest we pay on our liabilities, as borrowers prepay mortgage loans, and mortgage-backed securities and callable investment securities are called, requiring us to reinvest those cash flows at lower interest rates. In addition, the recent rate increase of 425 basis points combined with the outlook of future rate increases in an attempt to curb inflation, can affect the average life of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities. A rise in interest rates may result in lower demand for loans and mortgage-backed and related securities as borrowers may reduce their debts due to the higher costs of borrowings. Any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Changes in the level of interest rates also may negatively affect the value of our assets and ultimately affect our earnings. We monitor interest rate risk through the use of simulation models, including estimates of the amounts by which the economic value of our assets and liabilities (the Economic Value of Equity Model “EVE”) and our net interest income would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates. At December 31, 2022, in the event of an instantaneous 100 basis point increase in interest rates, we estimate that we would experience a 3.76% decrease in EVE and a 1.72% decrease in net interest income. For further discussion of how changes in interest rates could impact us, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Management of Market Risk—Net Interest Income Simulation Models and—Economic Value of Equity Model.” Changes in the valuation of securities held could adversely affect us. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, our securities portfolio totaled $640.3 million and $114.3 million, which represented 27.7% and 6.9% of total assets, respectively. The securities portfolio as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 were classified as available-for-sale in the amount of $129.5 and $113.3 million and held-to-maturity in the amount of $510.8 million and $0.9 million, respectively. A decline in the fair value of our available-for-sale securities could cause a material decline in our reported equity and/or net income. At least quarterly, and more frequently when warranted by economic or market conditions, management evaluates all securities with a decline in fair value below the amortized cost of the investment to determine whether the impairment is deemed to be other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”). For impaired debt securities that are intended to be sold, or more likely than not will be required to be sold, the full amount of market decline is recognized as OTTI through earnings. Credit-related OTTI for all other impaired debt securities is recognized through earnings. Non-credit related OTTI for debt securities is recognized in other comprehensive income net of applicable taxes for all securities classified as available-for-sale. A decline in the market value of our securities portfolio could adversely affect our earnings. Risks Related to Laws and Regulations. Changes in laws and regulations and the cost of regulatory compliance with new laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations and/or increase our costs of operations. The Bank is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC, and the Company is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board. Such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which the Bank and the Company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund, the depositors and borrowers of the Bank and consumers, rather than for our stockholders. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion 40 in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on our operations, the classification of our assets and influencing the level of our allowance for loan losses. These regulations, along with existing tax, accounting, securities, insurance and monetary laws, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations, control the methods by which financial institutions conduct business, implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance, and govern financial reporting and disclosures. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material impact on our operations. Further, changes in accounting standards can be both difficult to predict and involve judgment and discretion in interpretation by us. These changes could materially impact, potentially even retroactively, how we report our financial condition and results of operations. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) significantly changed the regulation of banks and savings institutions and affects the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The various federal agencies have adopted a broad range of rules and regulations in compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act. Compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act and its regulations and policies has resulted in changes to our business and operations, as well as additional costs, and has diverted management’s time from other business activities, all of which have adversely affected our financial condition and results of operations. Among other provisions recently enacted, the threshold to qualify for the Federal Reserve Board’s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement was increased to $3.0 billion and federally-chartered savings banks and associations have been provided flexibility to adopt the powers of a national bank. Our New York State multi-family loan portfolio could be adversely impacted by changes in legislation or regulation. On June 14, 2019, the New York State legislature passed the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019, impacting about one million rent regulated apartment units. Among other things, the new legislation: (i) curtails rent increases from Material Capital Improvements and Individual Apartment Improvements; (ii) all but eliminates the ability for apartments to exit rent regulation; (iii) does away with vacancy decontrol and high-income deregulation; and (iv) repealed the 20% vacancy bonus. While it is difficult to measure the full impact of the legislation, in total, it generally limits a landlord's ability to increase rents on rent regulated apartments and makes it more difficult to convert rent regulated apartments to market rate apartments. As a result, the value of the collateral located in New York State securing our multi-family loans or the future net operating income of such properties could potentially become impaired. Non-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions. The USA PATRIOT and Bank Secrecy Acts require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions, including restrictions on conducting acquisitions or establishing new branches. The policies and procedures we have adopted that are designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations may not be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations. Our ability to originate loans could be restricted by recently adopted federal regulations. The CFPB has a rule intended to clarify how lenders can avoid legal liability under the Dodd-Frank Act, which holds lenders accountable for ensuring a borrower’s ability to repay a mortgage loan. Under the rule, loans that meet the “qualified mortgage” definition will be presumed to have complied with the ability-to-repay standard. Under the rule, a “qualified mortgage” loan must not contain certain specified features, including: Also, to qualify as a “qualified mortgage,” a loan must be made to a borrower whose total monthly debt-to-income ratio does not exceed 43%. Lenders must also verify and document the income and financial resources relied upon to qualify a borrower for the loan 41 and underwrite the loan based on a fully amortizing payment schedule and maximum interest rate during the first five years, taking into account all applicable taxes, insurance and assessments. In addition, the CFPB has adopted rules and published forms that combine certain disclosures that consumers receive in connection with applying for and closing on certain mortgage loans under the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. We are subject to stringent capital requirements, which may adversely impact our return on equity, require us to raise additional capital, or limit our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares. The Bank’s minimum capital requirements are: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6.0%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8.0%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%. The capital requirements also establish a “capital conservation buffer” of 2.5%, which results in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%; and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. We have analyzed these capital requirements, and the Bank meets all of these requirements, including the 2.5% capital conservation buffer. The application of more stringent capital requirements could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, and result in regulatory actions if we are unable to comply with such requirements. Furthermore, the imposition of liquidity requirements in connection with the implementation of the requirements of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“Basel III”) could result in our having to lengthen the term of our funding sources, change our business models or increase our holdings of liquid assets. Ponce Bank’s ability to pay dividends to the Company will be limited if it does not have the capital conservation buffer required by the capital rules, which may further limit the Company’s ability to pay dividends to stockholders. See “Regulation and Supervision—Federal Banking Regulation—Capital Requirements.” The Federal Reserve Board may require us to commit capital resources to support Ponce Bank. Federal law requires that a holding company act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank. Under the “source of strength” doctrine, the Federal Reserve Board may require a holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to a subsidiary bank. A capital injection may be required at times when the holding company may not have the resources to provide it and therefore may be required to borrow the funds or raise capital. Any loans by a holding company to its subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a holding company’s bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the institution’s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of its note obligations. Thus, any borrowing that must be done by the Company to make a required capital injection becomes more difficult and expensive and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition to being affected by general economic conditions, our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve Board. An important function of the Federal Reserve Board is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve Board to implement these objectives are open market purchases and sales of U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate and changes in banks’ reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. The monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board have had a significant effect on the operating results of financial institutions in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The effects of such policies upon our business, financial condition and results of operations cannot be predicted. 42 We are a smaller reporting company, and any decision on our part to comply only with certain reduced reporting and disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies could make our common stock less attractive to investors. The Company is a smaller reporting company. For as long as the Company continues to be a smaller reporting company, it may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to smaller reporting companies, including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. As a smaller reporting company and a non-accelerated filer, the Company is not subject to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which would require that our independent auditors review and attest as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Investors may find our common stock less attractive since we have chosen to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and the price of our common stock may be more volatile. Risk Related to our Operations. We face significant operational risks because the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions and increased reliance on technology, including risk of loss related to cyber security breaches. We operate in diverse markets and rely on the ability of our employees and systems to process a high number of transactions and to collect, process, transmit and store significant amounts of confidential information regarding our customers, employees and others and concerning our own business, operations, plans and strategies. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside our company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, systems failures or interruptions, breaches of our internal control systems and compliance requirements, and business continuation and disaster recovery. Insurance coverage may not be available for such losses, or where available, such losses may exceed insurance limits. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of operational deficiencies or as a result of non-compliance with applicable regulatory standards or customer attrition due to potential negative publicity. In addition, we outsource some of our data processing to certain third-party providers. If these third-party providers encounter difficulties, including as a result of cyber-attacks or information security breaches, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely affected. We are also subject to risks related to the cyber vulnerabilities of our partners. We may experience negative impacts to our financial condition and results of operations if our partners are subject to cyber fraud or other security breaches, as we have experienced in our partnership with Grain. 43 In the event of a breakdown in our internal control systems, improper operation of systems or improper employee actions, or a breach of our security systems, including if confidential or proprietary information were to be mishandled, misused or lost, we could suffer financial loss, face regulatory action, civil litigation and/or suffer damage to our reputation. Negative developments in the U.S. in our primary markets may adversely impact our results in the future. Our financial performance is highly dependent on the business environment in the markets where we operate and in the U.S. as a whole. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity, investor or business confidence, consumer sentiment, limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital, increases in inflation or interest rates, natural disasters, international trade disputes and retaliatory tariffs, supply chain disruptions, terrorist attacks, global pandemics, acts of war, or a combination of these or other factors. Inflation rose sharply at the end of 2021 and has risen in 2022 at levels not seen for over 40 years. Inflationary pressures are currently expected to remain elevated throughout 2023. A worsening of business and economic conditions, or persistent inflationary pressures or supply chain disruptions, generally or specifically in the principal markets in which we conduct business could have adverse effects, including the following: Although economic conditions have improved in most of our markets, we continue to focus on growing earning assets, we believe that it is possible we will continue to experience an uncertain and volatile economic environment during 2023, including as a result of issues of national security, international conflicts, inflation and supply chain disruptions. There can be no assurance that these conditions will improve in the near term or that conditions will not worsen. Such conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The cost of finance and accounting systems, procedures and controls in order to satisfy our public company reporting requirements increases our expenses. The obligations of being a public company, including the substantial public reporting obligations, require significant expenditures and place additional demands on our management team. We have made, and will continue to make, changes to our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and accounting systems to meet our reporting obligations as a public company. However, the measures we take may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations as a public company. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Any failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price. In addition, we may need to hire additional compliance, accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical knowledge. As a result, we may need to rely on outside consultants to provide these services for us until qualified personnel are hired. These obligations will increase our operating expenses and could divert our management’s attention from our operations. Risks Related to Accounting Matters Changes in accounting standards could affect reported earnings. The bodies responsible for establishing accounting standards, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC and other regulatory bodies, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting guidance that governs the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply new or revised guidance retroactively. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “ Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” This ASU significantly changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. The Company has begun its evaluation of the amended guidance including the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements. As a result of the required change in approach toward determining estimated credit losses from the current “incurred loss” model to one based on estimated cash flows over a loan’s contractual life, adjusted for prepayments (a “life of loan” model), the Company expects that the new guidance will result in an increase in the allowance for loan losses, particularly for longer duration loan portfolios and this could have an adverse effect on our earnings. 44 Changes in management’s estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and our financial condition or operating results. Our management is and will be required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date to file periodic reports under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, including our consolidated financial statements. These estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include our evaluation of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses, the valuation of loans held for sale, the valuation of deferred tax assets and investment securities, the estimates relating to the valuation for share-based awards, and our determinations with respect to amounts owed for income taxes. Other Risks Related to Our Business and Industry Generally Financial challenges at other banking institutions could lead to depositor concerns that spread within the banking industry causing disruptive deposit outflows and other destabilizing results. In March 2023, certain specialized banking institutions with elevated concentrations of uninsured deposits experienced large deposit outflows coupled with insufficient liquidity to meet withdrawal demands, resulting in the institutions being placed into FDIC receiverships. In the aftermath, there has been substantial market disruption and indications that diminished depositor confidence could spread across the banking industry, leading to deposit outflows and other destabilizing results. The Federal Reserve Board has announced that it will provide funding to ensure that banks have sufficient liquidity to meet the needs of their depositors, but there can be no assurance whether such funding will be adequate to address these issues. The Company maintains a diversified deposit base and has a comparatively low level of uninsured deposits. As of December 31, 2022, 61.1% of our deposits are estimated to be FDIC-insured, and an additional 1.1% of deposits were fully collateralized. The average account size of our consumer deposits is less than $30,000, and the average account size of our business deposits is less than $60,000. Ineffective liquidity management could adversely affect our financial results and condition. Effective liquidity management is essential for the operation of our business. We require sufficient liquidity to meet customer loan requests, customer deposit maturities/withdrawals, payments on our debt obligations as they come due and other cash commitments under both normal operating conditions and other unpredictable circumstances causing industry or general financial market stress. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy generally. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a downturn in the geographic markets in which our loans and operations are concentrated or difficult credit markets. Our access to deposits may also be affected by the liquidity needs of our depositors. In particular, a majority of our liabilities are checking accounts and other liquid deposits, which are payable on demand or upon several days’ notice, while by comparison, a substantial majority of our assets are loans, which cannot be called or sold in the same time frame. Although we have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances as necessary, we might not be able to replace such funds in the future, especially if a large number of our depositors seek to withdraw their accounts, regardless of the reason. A failure to maintain adequate liquidity could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Legal and regulatory proceedings and related matters could adversely affect us. We have been and may in the future become involved in legal and regulatory proceedings. We consider most of the proceedings to be in the normal course of our business or typical for the industry; however, it is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters, and we may not prevail in any proceedings or litigation. There could be substantial cost and management diversion in such litigation and proceedings, and any adverse determination could have a materially adverse effect on our business, brand or image, or our financial condition and results of our operations. We are a community bank and our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance. The Bank is a community bank, and our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. A key component of our business strategy is to rely on our reputation for customer service and knowledge of local markets to expand our presence by capturing new business opportunities from existing and prospective customers in our market area and contiguous areas. As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve, delivering superior service to our customers and caring about our customers and associates. If our reputation is negatively affected by the actions of our employees, by our inability to conduct our operations in a manner that is appealing to current or prospective customers, or otherwise, our business and, therefore, our operating results may be materially adversely affected. 45 Our 2018 Equity Incentive Plan has increased our expenses and reduced our income, and may dilute your ownership interests. Stockholders previously approved the PDL Community Bancorp 2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan. During the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company recognized in $1.6 million and $1.4 million, respectively, in non-interest expense relating to this stock benefit plan, and we will recognize additional expenses in the future as additional grants are made and awards vest. The Company may fund the 2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan either through open market purchases or authorized but unissued shares of common stock. Our ability to repurchase shares of common stock to fund this plan will be subject to many factors, including, but not limited to, applicable regulatory restrictions on stock repurchases, the availability of stock in the market, the trading price of the stock, our capital levels, alternative uses for our capital and our financial performance. Stockholders would experience a reduction in ownership interest in the event newly issued shares of our common stock are used to fund stock issuances under the plan. New stock-based benefit plans will increase our expenses and reduce our income. The Company intends to adopt one or more new stock-based benefit plans, subject to stockholder approval, which will increase our annual compensation and benefit expenses related to the stock options and stock awards granted to participants under the stock-based benefit plan(s). The actual amount of these new stock-related compensation and benefit expenses will depend on the number of options and stock awards actually granted, the fair market value of our stock or options on the date of grant, the vesting period, and other factors which we cannot predict at this time. The implementation of stock-based benefit plans may dilute your ownership interest. Historically, stockholders have approved these stock-based benefit plans. The Company intends to adopt one or more new stock-based benefit plans. These plans may be funded either through open market purchases or from the issuance of authorized but unissued shares of common stock. Our ability to repurchase shares of common stock to fund these plans will be subject to many factors, including applicable regulatory restrictions on stock repurchases, the availability of stock in the market, the trading price of the stock, our capital levels, alternative uses for our capital and our financial performance. Stockholders would experience dilution in ownership interest in the event newly issued shares of our common stock are used to fund the stock-based benefit plan. Although the implementation of the stock-based benefit plan will be subject to stockholder approval, historically, the overwhelming majority of stock-based benefit plans adopted by savings institutions and their holding companies following mutual-to-stock conversions have been approved by stockholders. Societal responses to climate change could adversely affect our business and performance, including indirectly through impacts on our customers. Concerns over the long-term impacts of climate change have led and will continue to lead to governmental efforts around the world to mitigate those impacts. Consumers and businesses also may change their behavior on their own as a result of these concerns. We and our customers will need to respond to new laws and regulations as well as consumer and business preferences resulting from climate change concerns. We and our customers may face cost increases, asset value reductions and operating process changes. The impact on our customers will likely vary depending on their specific attributes, including reliance on or role in carbon intensive activities. Among the impacts to us could be a drop in demand for our products and services, particularly in certain sectors. In addition, we could face reductions in creditworthiness on the part of some customers or in the value of assets securing loans. Our efforts to take these risks into account in making lending and other decisions, including by increasing our business with climate-friendly companies, may not be effective in protecting us from the negative impact of new laws and regulations or changes in consumer or business behavior. Our historical markets, minority and immigrant individuals, may be threatened by gentrification and adverse political developments, which could decrease our growth and profitability. We believe that our historical strength has been our focus on the minority and immigrant markets. The continuing displacement of minorities due to gentrification of our communities may adversely affect us unless we are able to adapt and increase the acceptance of our products and services by non-minority customers. We may also be unfavorably impacted by political developments unfavorable to markets that are dependent on immigrant populations. Item 1B. Unresolve d Staff Comments. Not applicable. 46 Item 2.

Mine Saf ety Disclosures. Not applicable. 48 PAR T II Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stoc kholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. The Company’s shares of common stock are traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market, LLC under the symbol “PDLB”. The number of stockholders of record of the Company’s common stock as of March 16, 2023 was 379. The number of record-holders may not reflect the number of persons or entities holding stock in nominee name through banks, brokerage firms and other nominees. To date, the Company (or its predecessor PDL Community Bancorp) has not paid any dividends to its stockholders. We have no current plan or intention to pay cash dividends to our common stockholders. However, if in the future the Board of Directors considers the payment of dividends, the amount of any dividend payments will be subject to statutory and regulatory limitations, and will depend upon a number of factors, including the following: regulatory capital requirements; our financial condition and results of operations; our other uses of funds for the long-term value of stockholders; tax considerations; and general economic conditions. No assurance can be given that the Board of Directors will ever consider the payment of dividends, and common stockholders should have no expectation of such. The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement providing that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if our prospective rate of earnings retention is consistent with our capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance also provides for prior regulatory consultation with respect to capital distributions in certain circumstances such as where the holding company’s net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the holding company’s overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with its capital needs and overall financial condition. In addition, the Company’s ability to pay dividends will be limited if it does not have the capital conservation buffer required by the capital rules, which may limit our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. See “Regulation and Supervision—Federal Bank Regulation—Capital Requirements.” No assurances can be given that any dividends will be paid or that, if paid, will not be reduced or eliminated in the future. We will file a consolidated federal tax return. Accordingly, it is anticipated that any cash distributions that we make to our stockholders would be treated as cash dividends and not as a non-taxable return of capital for federal and state tax purposes. Pursuant to our charter, we are authorized to issue preferred stock. The Company‎ closed a private placement of 225,000 shares of the Company’s Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A‎, par value $0.01 for an aggregate purchase price equal to $225.0 million in cash, to the Treasury pursuant to the ECIP.‎ The Preferred Stock will have a priority over the holders of our shares of common stock with respect to the payment of dividends. For a further discussion concerning the payment of dividends on our shares of common stock, see “Regulation and Supervision—Holding Company Regulations—Dividends and Stock Repurchases.” Dividends we can declare and pay will depend, in part, upon receipt of dividends from Ponce Bank, because currently we will have no source of income other than dividends from Ponce Bank and earnings from the investment of funds held by the Company and interest payments received in connection with the loan to the employee stock ownership plan. Regulations of the Federal Reserve Board and the OCC impose limitations on “capital distributions” by savings institutions. See “Regulation and Supervision—Federal Bank Regulation—Capital Requirements.” Any payment of dividends by Ponce Bank to the Company that would be deemed to be drawn out of Ponce Bank’s bad debt reserves, if any, would require a payment of taxes at the then-current tax rate by Ponce Bank on the amount of earnings deemed to be removed from the reserves for such distribution. Ponce Bank does not intend to make any distribution to the Company that would create such a federal tax liability. See “Taxation.” Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities; Use of Proceeds from Registered Securities On June 7, 2022, the Company issued 225,000 shares of Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A‎, par value $0.01 for the capital investment of $225.0 million from the Treasury under the ECIP. For additional information, see Note 2, “Preferred Stock Issuance; Plan of Conversion and Stock Offering,” to the accompanying Financial Statements. Item 6. R eserved. 49 Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those described below. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those described in Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors,” within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Discussion and analysis of our 2021 fiscal year specifically, as well as the year-over-year comparison of our 2021 financial performance to 2020, are located under Part II, Item 7 — Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021 filed with the SEC on March 31, 2022, which is available on our investor relations website at poncebank.gcs-web.com and the SEC's website at sec.gov. Overview On January 26, 2022, the assets and liabilities of Mortgage World Bankers, Inc. (“Mortgage World”), a wholly owned subsidiary of PDL Community Bancorp, were transferred to the Bank. Except for the winding up of its operations, Mortgage World ceased to conduct business as a separate entity and is now operated as a division of the Bank. On January 27, 2022, Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and PDL Community Bancorp announced that the conversion and reorganization of Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company from the mutual to stock form of organization and related stock offering was consummated at the close of business. As a result of the closing of the conversion and reorganization and stock offering, Ponce Financial Group, Inc. is now the holding company for Ponce Bank. Ponce Bank’s former mutual holding companies, PDL Community Bancorp and Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company, have ceased to exist. We have made significant investments over the last several years in adding experienced bankers, expanding our lending and relationship staff, absorbing the costs of being a public company, upgrading technology and facilities. These investments have increased our operating expenses during those periods. However, during those same periods, we have been able to significantly grow the Bank’s loan portfolio while maintaining a moderate risk profile and strengthening its capital. Abrupt changes in interest rates will present us with a challenge in managing our interest rate risk. As a general matter, our interest-bearing liabilities reprice or mature more quickly than our interest-earning assets, which can result in interest expense increasing more rapidly than increases in interest income. Therefore, increases in interest rates may adversely affect our net interest income and net economic value, which in turn would likely have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Conversely, decreases in interest rates may have a favorable effect on our net interest income and net economic value, which in turn would likely have a positive effect on our results of operations. As described in “—Management of Market Risk,” we expect that our net interest income and our net economic value would react inversely to instantaneous changes in interest rates. To help manage interest rate risk, we promote core deposit products and we are diversifying our loan portfolio by introducing new lending programs. See “—Business Strategy”, “—Management of Market Risk” and “Risk Factors—Future changes in interest rates could reduce our profits and asset values.” Non-GAAP Financial Measures The following discussion contains certain non-GAAP financial measures in addition to results presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures are intended to provide the reader with additional supplemental perspective on operating results, performance trends, and financial condition. Non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for GAAP measures; they should be read and used in conjunction with the Company’s GAAP financial information. The Company’s non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP information which may be presented by other companies. In all cases, it should be understood that non-GAAP operating measures do not depict amounts that accrue directly to the benefit of shareholders. An item that management excludes when computing non-GAAP adjusted earnings can be of substantial importance to the Company’s results and condition for any particular year. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures is provided below. The SEC has exempted from the definition of non-GAAP financial measures certain commonly used financial measures that are not based on GAAP. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and facilitate comparisons with the performance of other financial institutions. However, the information should be considered supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The table below includes references to the Company's net (loss) income and (loss) earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 before loss (gain) on sale of premises and equipment and the Company’s contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation. In management's view, that information, which is considered non-GAAP information, may be useful to investors as it will improve an understanding of core operations for the current and future periods. The non-GAAP net (loss) income amount and 50 (loss) earnings per share reflect adjustments related to the non-recurring gain on sale of real property and the Company’s contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation, net of tax effect. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP information to GAAP net (loss) income and (loss) earnings per share is provided below. Non-GAAP Reconciliation – Net Income Before (Loss) Gain on Sale of Premises and Equipment and Contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation (Unaudited) For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net (loss) income - GAAP $ (30,001 ) $ 25,415 Loss (gain) on sale of premises and equipment 436 (20,270 ) Contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation 4,995 — Income tax (benefit) provision (1,141 ) 4,257 Net (loss) income - non-GAAP $ (25,711 ) $ 9,402 (Loss) earnings per common share (GAAP) (1) $ (1.32 ) $ 1.52 (Loss) earnings per common share (non-GAAP) (1) $ (1.13 ) $ 0.56 The CARES Act On March 27, 2020, Congress passed, and the President signed, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) to address the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act appropriated $349.0 billion for PPP loans and on April 24, 2020, the U.S. Small Business Administration (“SBA”) received another $310.0 billion in PPP funding. On December 27, 2020, the Economic Aid Act appropriated $284.0 billion for both first and second draw PPP loans, bringing the total appropriations for PPP loans to $943.0 billion. PPP ended on May 31, 2021. Loans under the PPP that meet SBA requirements may be forgiven in certain circumstances, and are 100% guaranteed by the SBA. The Company had received SBA approval and originated 5,340 PPP loans, of which 71 loans totaling $20.0 million were outstanding at December 31, 2022. PPP loans have a two-year or five-year term, provide for fees of up to 5% of the loan amount and earn interest at a rate of 1% per annum. It is our expectation that a significant portion of these remaining loans will ultimately be forgiven by the SBA in accordance with the terms of the program. As of December 31, 2022, the average authorized loan size was $282,000 and the median authorized loan size was $15,000. The Bank, which is designated as both a CDFI and a Minority Depository Institution MDI, originated 5,340 PPP loans in the amount of $261.4 million, which, based upon information provided by the SBA, significantly exceeded the reported average performance of banks in our peer group. Federal Economic Relief Funds To Aid Lending to Small Businesses On August 10, 2021, the Company through its subsidiary, the Bank, received from the United States Department of the Treasury (“Treasury”) a grant in the amount of $1.8 million in federal Economic Relief Funds for Small Businesses under the Treasury’s Rapid Response Program for CDFIs. The Rapid Response Program grants may be used to support eligible activities of CDFIs such as financial products, financial services, development services, and certain operational activities, and to enable recipient CDFIs to build capital reserves and loan-loss reserves. On June 7, 2022, the Company‎ closed a private placement (the “Private Placement”) of 225,000 shares of the Company’s Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A‎, par value $0.01 (the “Preferred Stock”) for an aggregate purchase price equal to $225,000,000 in cash, to the United States Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury”) pursuant to the Emergency Capital Investment Program (“ECIP”).‎ The holders of the Preferred Stock will be entitled to a dividend payable in cash quarterly at an annual rate dependent on certain factors as reported by the Company to Treasury in a quarterly supplemental report. The initial dividend rate is zero percent for the first two years after issuance, and thereafter the floor dividend rate is 0.50% and the ceiling dividend rate is 2.00%. After 10 years of issuance, the perpetual dividend rate in effect, will be determined based on said floor and ceiling. The actual dividend rate that will be paid by the Company on the Preferred Stock cannot be determined at this time. 51 The ECIP investment by the Treasury is part of a program to invest over $8.7 billion into CDFI or ‎MDI, of which Ponce Bank is both. The ECIP is intended to incentivize CDFIs and MDIs to provide loans, grants, ‎and forbearance to small businesses, minority-owned businesses, and consumers in low-income and underserved communities that may have been ‎disproportionately impacted by the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the Preferred Stock will be entitled to a liquidation preference, subject to certain limitations, in the amount of the sum of $1,000 per share plus declared and unpaid dividends (without accumulation of undeclared dividends) on each share. Critical Accounting Policies Accounting estimates are necessary in the application of certain accounting policies and procedures and are particularly susceptible to significant change. Critical accounting policies are defined as those involving significant judgments and assumptions by management and that could have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets, liabilities or on income under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes that the most critical accounting policy relates to the allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses is established as probable incurred losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in conformity with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of income and expenses. The estimates and assumptions used are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations. Factors Affecting the Comparability of Results Purchase of Real Property. On January 22, 2021, the Bank completed the purchase of property located at 135-12/14 Northern Boulevard, Flushing, New York through a qualified intermediary in an IRS Code 1031 like-kind exchange related to the previously disclosed sale of real property on July 27, 2020 that was owned by the Bank. The purchase price of the property was $3.6 million. Sale of Real Properties. On February 11, 2021, the Company completed the sale of real property located at 3821 Bergenline Avenue, Union City, New Jersey for a sale price of $2.4 million. Concurrent with the sale, the Bank and the purchaser entered into a fifteen-year lease agreement whereby the Bank will lease back this real property at an initial annual base rent of approximately $145,000 subject to annual rent increases of 1.5%. Under the lease agreement, the Bank has four (4) consecutive options to extend the term of the lease by five (5) years for each such option. The sale lease-back resulted in a gain of approximately $623,000, net of expenses, which is included in other non-interest income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. On June 4, 2021, the Company completed the sale of real property located at 5560 Broadway, Bronx, New York for a sale price of $5.7 million. Concurrent with the sale, the Bank and the purchaser entered into a fifteen-year lease agreement whereby the Bank will lease back this real property at an initial annual base rent of approximately $281,000 subject to annual rent increases of 1.75%. The sale lease-back resulted in a gain of approximately $4.2 million, net of expenses, which is included in other non-interest income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. On November 10, 2021, the Company completed the sale of real property located at 2244 Westchester Avenue, Bronx, New York for a sale price of $16.1 million. Concurrent with the sale, the Bank and the purchaser entered into a seventeen-year lease agreement whereby the Bank will lease back this real property at an initial annual base rent of approximately $926,000, subject to annual rent increases of 1.75%. The sale lease-back resulted in a gain of approximately $8.7 million, net of expenses, which is included in other non-interest income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. On November 12, 2021, the Company completed the sale of real property located at 169-174 Smith Street, Brooklyn, New York for a sale price of $4.0 million. Concurrent with the sale, the Bank and the purchaser entered into a fifteen-year lease agreement whereby the Bank will lease back this real property at an initial annual base rent of approximately $200,000 subject to annual rent increases of 1.50%. The sale lease-back resulted in a gain of approximately $3.7 million, net of expenses, which is included in other non-interest income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. 52 On December 16, 2021, the Company completed the sale of real property located at 37-60 82 nd Street, Jackson Heights, New York for a sale price of $11.8 million. Concurrent with the sale, the Bank and the purchaser entered into a seventeen-year lease agreement whereby the Bank will lease back this real property at an initial annual base rent of approximately $530,000 subject to annual rent increases of 2.0%. The sale lease-back resulted in a gain of approximately $3.1 million, net of expenses, which is included in other non-interest income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Ponce De Leon Foundation. On January 27, 2022, the Company made a $5.0 million contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation as part of the conversion and reorganization, which is included in non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Write-off and Write-Down. In 2020, the Company entered into a business arrangement with the FinTech startup company Grain. Grain’s product is a mobile application geared to the underbanked, minorities and new generations entering the financial services market. In employing this mobile application, the Bank uses non-traditional underwriting methodologies to provide revolving credit to borrowers who otherwise may gravitate to using alternative non-bank lenders. Under the terms of its agreement with Grain, the Bank is the lender for Grain-originated microloans with credit lines currently up to $1,500 and, where applicable, the depository for related security deposits. Grain originates and services these microloans and is responsible for maintaining compliance with the Bank's origination and servicing standards, as well as applicable regulatory and legal requirements. If a microloan is found to be fraudulent, becomes 90 days delinquent upon 90 days of origination or defaults due to a failure of Grain to properly service the microloan, the Bank’s applicable standards for origination or servicing are deemed to have not been complied with and the microloan is put back to Grain, who then becomes responsible for the microloan and any related losses. The microloans put back to Grain are accounted for as an “other asset,” specifically referred to herein as the “Grain Receivable.” The Bank, pursuant to its agreement with Grain, at December 31, 2021, had 59,180 microloans outstanding, net of put backs, with credit extensions aggregating $33.9 million. Of these microloans, the Bank estimates that 80 percent have been made in low- and low-to-moderate income census tracts with an estimated 56 percent made to minority borrowers. In establishing these lines of credit, the Company reserved the right to modify borrowers’ credit limits at its sole discretion. The Company continues to balance its risks as needed and continue to support a wide base of customers. Based on the overall performance of the Grain portfolio, as well as current economic factors, the Company reduced the amount of credit available to Grain application customers on a uniform and program-wide basis, with each borrower’s credit limit reduced to the amount that was outstanding under that borrower’s line of credit. The Company also reserved the right to make further modifications to credit limits as it may deem appropriate under the circumstances, whether on a program-wide or individual basis. No new loans were made by the Comp any after May 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022, the Bank had 27,886 Grain microloans outstanding, net of put backs, with an aggregate balance totaling $18.2 million and which were performing, in management’s opinion, comparably to similar portfolios, offset by a $15.4 million allowance for loan losses, resulting in $2.8 million in Grain microloans, net of allowance for loan losses. Since the beginning of the Bank’s agreement with Grain and through December 31, 2022, 45,322 microloans amounting to $25.5 million have been deemed to be fraudulent and put back to Grain. The Company has written-down a total of $17.5 million of the Grain Receivable for the year ended December 31, 2022 and received $6.2 million in cash from Grain and through the application of security deposits connected to fraudulent loan accounts. The Bank also opted to use the $1.8 million grant it received from the U.S. Treasury Department’s Rapid Response ‎Program to defray the Grain Receivable. The application of those amounts resulted in no net receivable. Additionally, the Company has also written-off its equity investment in Grain of $1.0 million. As of December 31, 2022, the Company’s total remaining exposure to Grain was $2.8 million of the remaining microloans, net of allowance for loan losses excluding $0.4 million of unused commitments available to Grain borrowers and $1.4 million of security deposits by Grain borrowers. The $16.9 million write-off and write-down, net of $0.5 million of recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2022 is included in non-interest expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. 53 Grain Technologies, Inc.

Excludes $1.4 million of security deposits by Grain originated borrowers. Grain has been victimized by cyber fraud using synthetic and other forms of fraudulent identifications, a phenomenon that has become prevalent with Fintechs. Grain remains a pre-profit startup highly dependent on earnings from its relationship with the Bank, a new relationship with another financial institution, and further capital raises which may not materialize. The Company continues to closely monitor its portfolio of consumer loans originated by Grain as well as Grain’s refinement of solutions for detecting and preventing cyber fraud in the application for microloans. The Company has requested, and Grain has agreed, that no new microloans be originated until further notice and that further extensions of credit to an existing microloan borrower only be made upon confirmation that such borrower is not fraudulent. Further, like other start-up companies, there is a higher level of risk that Grain may not be able to execute its business plan and may fail. In the event Grain were to cease operations, and although it has considered contingency plans, the Bank may have greater difficulty in servicing and collecting the microloan portfolio. In such a case, the level the Bank has provided for in its allowance for loan losses for its microloan portfolio may be inadequate and it may need to increase its provision for loan losses, which could materially decrease the Company’s net income. As a consequence of such events, the Bank may determine it appropriate to terminate its relationship with Grain. Vision 2025 Evolves The Company has deployed a Fintech-based small business automated lending technology in partnership with LendingFront Technologies, Inc. The technology is a mobile application that digitizes the lending workflow from pre-approval to servicing and enables the Company to originate, close and fund small business loans within very short spans of time, without requiring a physical presence within banking offices and with automated underwriting using both traditional and non-traditional methods. The application has full loan origination and servicing capabilities and is integrated with Salesforce. All Commercial Relationship Officers and Business Development Managers will utilize these capabilities. The Company is seeking to establish loan origination partnerships with non-profit and community-based organizations to ensure penetration in underserved and underbanked markets. The Company also established a relationship with SaveBetter, LLC, a fintech startup focusing on brokered deposits. As of December 31, 2022, the Company had $156.7 million in such deposits. The recent regulatory easing of brokered deposit rules may enable the Company to classify such deposits as core deposits. On October 1, 2022, Ponce Bank entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement with Bamboo Payment Holding LLC (""Bamboo""). Under this agreement, Ponce Bank purchased from Bamboo 180 Membership Interest Units representing an aggregate amount equal to up to 18% of total issued and outstanding Membership Interest in Bamboo for a purchase price of $2.5 million. With over a decade processing payments in Latin America, Bamboo has a diverse network connects Latin American local payment processing to global companies as well as domestic solutions to locally based organizations. At December 31, 2018, the Company had approximately $1.06 billion in assets, $918.5 million in loans and $809.8 million in deposits. The Company has since grown to $2.31 billion in assets, $1.49 billion in loans receivables, net of allowance for loan losses of 54 $34.6 million, and $1.25 billion in deposits at December 31, 2022, all while investing in infrastructure, implementing digital banking, acquiring Mortgage World, adopting GPS, diversifying its product offering, partnering with Fintech companies and assisting its communities with 5,340 PPP loans totaling $261.4 million. The Company raised over $132.0 million in additional capital through our conversion and reorganization and realized approximately $20.0 million in net gain while freeing up approximately $40.0 million in investable funds through our sale-and-leaseback initiative. Now, the Company believes that it is poised to enhance its presence, locally and in similar communities outside New York, as a leading CDFI and MDI financial institution holding company. On June 7, 2022, the Company issued 225,000 shares of the Company’s Preferred Stock‎, par value $0.01 for an aggregate purchase price equal to $225.0 million in cash to the Treasury, pursuant to the Treasury’s ECIP‎. Under the ECIP, Treasury provided investment capital directly to depository institutions that are CDFIs or MDIs or their holding companies, to provide loans, grants, and forbearance for small businesses, minority-owned businesses, and consumers, in low-income and underserved communities. Treasury has indicated that the investment will qualify as Tier 1 capital. No dividends will accrue or be due for the first two years after issuance. For years three through ten, depending upon the level of qualified and/or deep impact lending made in targeted communities, as defined in the ECIP guidelines, dividends will be at an annual rate of either 2.0%, 1.25% or 0.5% and, thereafter, will be fixed at one of the foregoing rates. Holders of Preferred Stock generally do not have any voting rights, with the exception of voting rights on certain matters as outlined in the Certificate of Designations. The Company has the option to redeem the shares of Preferred Stock (i) in whole or in part on any dividend payment date on or after June 15, 2027, or (ii) in whole but not in part at any time within ninety days following a Regulatory Capital Treatment Event, as defined below, in each case at a cash redemption price equal to the liquidation amount, with an amount equal to any dividends that have been declared but not paid prior to the redemption date. The Company may not redeem shares of Preferred Stock without having received the prior approval of the appropriate Federal banking agency for the Company, as defined in Section 3(q) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, to the extent required under applicable capital rules. Such redemptions are subject to certain conditions and limitations. In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the Preferred Stock will be entitled to a liquidation preference, subject to certain limitations, in the amount of the sum of $1,000 per share plus declared and unpaid dividends (without accumulation of undeclared dividends) on each share. A “Regulatory Capital Treatment Event” means a good-faith determination that, as a result of (i) any amendment to, or change in, the laws, rules or regulations of the United States or any political subdivision of or in the United States (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any agency or instrumentality of the United States, including the Federal Reserve and other appropriate federal bank regulatory agencies) that is enacted or becomes effective after the initial issuance of any share of the Preferred Stock; (ii) any proposed change in those laws, rules or regulations that is announced after the initial issuance of any share of the Preferred Stock; or (iii) any official administrative or judicial decision or administrative action or other official pronouncement interpreting or applying those laws, rules or regulations or policies with respect thereto that is announced or becomes effective after the initial issuance of the Preferred Stock, there is more than an insubstantial risk that we will not be entitled to treat the full liquidation preferences of the shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding as “Additional Tier 1 Capital” (or its equivalent) for purposes of the capital adequacy standards of Federal Reserve Regulation Q, 12 C.F.R. Part 217 (or, as and if applicable, the successor capital adequacy guidelines, rules or regulations of the Federal Reserve or the capital adequacy guidelines, rules or regulations of any successor appropriate federal banking agency), as then in effect and applicable, for as long as any share of Preferred Stock is outstanding. Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 Total Assets . Total consolidated assets increased $658.5 million, or 39.8%, to $2.31 billion at December 31, 2022 from $1.65 billion at December 31, 2021. The increase in total assets is largely attributable to an increase of $509.9 million resulting from the purchases in held-to-maturity securities utilizing the $225.0 million received from the issuance of Preferred Stock to the Treasury pursuant to its ECIP. The increase in total assets is further impacted by increases of $188.0 million in net loans receivable (inclusive of a $116.70 million net decrease in PPP loans) $33.4 million in right of use assets, $18.7 million in FHLBNY stock, $16.2 million resulting from the purchase of available-for-sale securities and $12.3 million in deferred tax assets. This increase is partially offset by decreases of $99.5 million in cash and equivalents, $13.9 million in mortgage loans held for sale, at fair value and $6.2 million in other assets. Cash and Cash Equivalents . Cash and cash equivalents decreased $99.5 million, or 64.7%, to $54.4 million at December 31, 2022, compared to $153.9 million at December 31, 2021. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily the result of purchases of securities, mostly held to maturity securities, net purchases of FHLBNY stock, an increase in net loans, a contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation and a decrease in advances of warehouse lines of credit. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was offset from proceeds for the issuance of Preferred Stock to the Treasury, proceeds from advances from the FHLBNY, an increase in net deposits, proceeds from maturities/calls of securities and the sale of loans. Securities . The composition of securities at December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the amounts maturing of each classification are summarized as follows: 55 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Amortized Fair Amortized Fair Cost Value Cost Value (in thousands) Available-for-Sale Securities: U.S. Government Bonds: Amounts maturing: Three months or less $ — $ — $ — $ — More than three months through one year — — — — More than one year through five years 2,985 2,689 2,981 2,934 More than five years through ten years — — — — 2,985 2,689 2,981 2,934 Corporate Bonds: Amounts maturing: Three months or less — — — — More than three months through one year — — — — More than one year through five years 4,000 3,710 4,445 4,381 More than five years through ten years 21,824 19,649 16,798 16,803 25,824 23,359 21,243 21,184 Mortgage-Backed Securities 123,134 103,457 90,950 89,228 Total Available-for-Sale Securities $ 151,943 $ 129,505 $ 115,174 $ 113,346 Held-to-Maturity Securities: U.S. Agency Bonds: Amounts maturing: Three months or less $ — $ — $ — $ — More than three months through one year — — — — More than one year through five years 35,000 34,620 — — More than five years through ten years — — — — 35,000 34,620 — — Corporate Bonds: Amounts maturing: Three months or less $ — $ — $ — $ — More than three months through one year — — — — More than one year through five years 75,000 71,328 — — More than five years through ten years 7,500 7,410 — — 82,500 78,738 — — Mortgage-Backed Securities 393,320 382,493 934 914 Total Held-to-Maturity Securities $ 510,820 $ 495,851 $ 934 $ 914 The Company securities portfolio increased $509.9 million in held-to-maturity and $16.2 million in available-for-sale during the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was mainly attributable to $528.9 million in held-to-maturity securities and $58.4 million in available-for-sale securities that were purchased during the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase was offset primarily by $34.9 million in principal payments, $20.6 million in unrealized loss and two available-for-sale securities in the amount of $5.4 million that matured and/or were called during the year ended December 31, 2022. There were no held-to-maturity securities and available-for-sale securities sold during the years ended December 31, 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the Company invested primarily in held-to-maturity securities utilizing the $225.0 million the Company received from the issuance of preferred stock to the Treasury pursuant to its ECIP and from cash received from deposits made by its customers. Gross Loans Receivable . The composition of gross loans receivable at December 31, 2022 and 2021 and the percentage of each classification to total loans are summarized as follows: 56 December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Increase (Decrease) Amount Percent Amount Percent Dollars Percent (Dollars in thousands) Mortgage loans: 1-4 Family residential Investor-Owned $ 343,968 22.6 % $ 317,304 24.1 % $ 26,664 8.4 % Owner-Occupied 134,878 8.8 % 96,947 7.3 % 37,931 39.1 % Multifamily residential 494,667 32.4 % 348,300 26.3 % 146,367 42.0 % Nonresidential properties 308,043 20.2 % 239,691 18.1 % 68,352 28.5 % Construction and land 185,018 12.1 % 134,651 10.2 % 50,367 37.4 % Total mortgage loans 1,466,574 96.1 % 1,136,893 86.0 % 329,681 29.0 % Nonmortgage loans: Business loans (1) 39,965 2.6 % 150,512 11.4 % (110,547 ) (73.5 %) Consumer loans (2) 19,129 1.3 % 34,693 2.6 % (15,564 ) (44.9 %) 59,094 3.9 % 185,205 14.0 % (126,111 ) (68.1 %) Total $ 1,525,668 100.0 % $ 1,322,098 100.0 % $ 203,570 15.4 % Allowance for loan losses were $34.6 million and $16.4 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Included in allowance for loan losses were $15.4 million and 1.4 million related to Grain at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The following table presents the Company’s PPP loans outstanding as of December 31, 2022: Aggregate Median Average Number Amount Amount Amount State Counties of Loans of Loans of Loans of Loans (Dollars in thousands) New York Albany 1 $ 86 $ 86 $ 86 Bronx 15 1,610 13 107 Kings 15 15,147 21 1,010 Nassau 2 27 14 14 New York 12 1,363 18 114 Queens 11 127 10 12 Suffolk 2 20 10 10 Westchester 2 17 8 9 Total New York 60 $ 18,397 $ 15 $ 307 New Jersey Bergen 2 $ 135 $ 68 $ 68 Essex 4 33 5 8 Hudson 3 952 441 317 Monmouth 1 503 503 503 Union 1 11 11 11 Total New Jersey 11 $ 1,634 $ 15 $ 149 Total 71 $ 20,031 $ 15 $ 282 The $203.6 million increase in the gross loan portfolio was primarily the result of an increase of $320.3 million in non-PPP loans, offset by a $116.7 million decrease in PPP loans at December 31, 2022 compared to December 31, 2021. Based on current internal loan reviews, the Company believes that the quality of our underwriting, our weighted average loan-to-value ratio of 58.6% and our customer selection processes have served us well and provided us with a reliable base with which to maintain a well-protected loan portfolio. Commercial real estate loans, as defined by applicable banking regulations, include multifamily residential, nonresidential properties, and construction and land mortgage loans. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, approximately 6.4% and 7.9%, respectively, of the outstanding principal balance of the Bank’s commercial real estate mortgage loans were secured by owner-occupied commercial real estate. Owner-occupied commercial real estate is similar in many ways to commercial and industrial lending in that these loans are generally made to businesses predominantly on the basis of the cash flows of the business rather than on valuation of the real estate. Banking regulations have established guidelines relating to the amount of construction and land mortgage loans and investor- owned commercial real estate mortgage loans of 100% and 300% of total risk-based capital, respectively. Should a bank’s ratios be in 57 excess of these guidelines, banking regulations generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by bank management. The Bank’s policy is to operate within the 100% guideline for construction and land mortgage loans and up to 400% for investor owned commercial real estate mortgage loans. Both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by the Bank’s total risk-based capital. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Bank’s construction and land mortgage loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital was 38.5% and 79.6%, respectively. Investor owned commercial real estate mortgage loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital was 194.0% and 396.2% as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. At December 31, 2022, the Bank was within the 100% guideline for construction and land mortgage loans and the 300% guideline for investor owned commercial real estate mortgage loans established by banking regulators. Management believes that it has established the appropriate level of controls to monitor the Bank’s lending in these areas. Mortgage Loans Held For Sale . Mortgage loans held for sale, at fair value, at December 31, 2022 decreased $13.9 million to $2.0 million from $15.8 million at December 31, 2021. Deposits . The composition of deposits at December 31, 2022 and 2021 and changes in dollars and percentages are summarized as follows: December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 Increase (Decrease) Percent Percent Amount of Total Amount of Total Dollars Percent (Dollars in thousands) Demand $ 289,149 23.1 % $ 274,956 22.8 % $ 14,193 5.2 % Interest-bearing deposits: NOW/IOLA accounts 24,349 1.9 % 35,280 2.9 % (10,931 ) (31.0 %) Money market accounts 317,815 25.4 % 186,893 15.5 % 130,922 70.1 % Reciprocal deposits 114,049 9.1 % 143,221 11.9 % (29,172 ) (20.4 %) Savings accounts 130,432 10.4 % 134,887 11.2 % (4,455 ) (3.3 %) Total NOW, money market, reciprocal and savings 586,645 46.8 % 500,281 41.5 % 86,364 17.3 % Certificates of deposit of $250K or more 70,113 5.6 % 78,454 6.5 % (8,341 ) (10.6 %) Brokered certificates of deposit (1) 98,754 7.9 % 79,320 6.6 % 19,434 24.5 % Listing service deposits (1) 35,813 2.9 % 66,411 5.5 % (30,598 ) (46.1 %) Certificates of deposit less than $250K 171,938 13.7 % 205,294 17.1 % (33,356 ) (16.2 %) Total certificates of deposit 376,618 30.1 % 429,479 35.7 % (52,861 ) (12.3 %) Total interest-bearing deposits 963,263 76.9 % 929,760 77.2 % 33,503 3.6 % Total deposits $ 1,252,412 100.0 % $ 1,204,716 100.0 % $ 47,696 4.0 % When wholesale funding is necessary to complement the Company's core deposit base, management determines which source is best suited to address both liquidity risk and interest rate risk in line with management objectives. The Company’s Interest Rate Risk Policy imposes limitations on overall wholesale funding and noncore funding reliance. The overall reliance on wholesale funding and noncore funding were within those policy limitations as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. The Management Asset/Liability Committee generally meets on a bi-weekly basis to review funding needs, if any, and to ensure the Company operates within the approved limitations. Advances from FHLBNY. The Bank had outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2022 and 2021 of $517.4 million and $106.3 million, respectively. These borrowings are in the form of advances from the FHLBNY. Warehouse Lines of Credit . At December 31, 2021, Mortgage World had maintained two warehouse lines of credit with financial institutions for the purpose of funding the origination and sale of residential mortgages. At December 31, 2021, Mortgage World utilized $15.1 million for funding of mortgage loans held for sale and had unused lines of credit of $14.9 million. At December 31, 2022, there was no remaining balance on such lines of credit. During the first quarter of 2022, Mortgage World became a division of the Bank and the Bank began funding these loans. At December 31, 2022, there was one warehouse line of credit with an unused commitment of $10.0 million. This line of credit was terminated on February 7, 2023. The other warehouse line of credit was terminated on March 31, 2022. Stockholders’ Equity. The Company’s consolidated stockholders’ equity increased $303.4 million, or 160.3%, to $492.7 million at December 31, 2022, from $189.3 million at December 31, 2021. This increase in stockholders’ equity was largely attributable to the $225.0 million issuance of Preferred Stock to the Treasury pursuant to its ECIP and the $118.0 million received as a result of the sale of common stock in the conversion of the mutual holding company to a stock company. 58 Comparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 The discussion of the Company’s results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are presented below. The results of operations for periods may not be indicative of future results. Ponce Financial Group, Inc., as the successor by merger with PDL Community Bancorp Consolidated The following table presents the results of operations for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, Increase (Decrease) 2022 2021 Dollars Percent (Dollars in thousands) Interest and dividend income $ 82,752 $ 67,098 $ 15,654 23.3 % Interest expense 16,149 8,252 7,897 95.7 % Net interest income 66,603 58,846 7,757 13.2 % Provision for loan losses 24,046 2,717 21,329 785.0 % Net interest income after provision for loan losses 42,557 56,129 (13,572 ) (24.2 %) Non-interest income 6,419 34,637 (28,218 ) (81.5 %) Non-interest expense 85,822 57,142 28,680 50.2 % (Loss) income before income taxes (36,846 ) 33,624 (70,470 ) (209.6 %) (Benefit) provision for income taxes (6,845 ) 8,209 (15,054 ) (183.4 %) Net (loss) income $ (30,001 ) $ 25,415 $ (55,416 ) (218.0 %) (Loss) earnings per share: Basic $ (1.32 ) $ 1.52 $ (2.84 ) (187.1 %) Diluted $ (1.32 ) $ 1.51 $ (2.83 ) (187.4 %) Net (Loss) Income. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2022 was ($30.0) million compared to net income of $25.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Loss per basic share and diluted share was ($1.32) for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to earnings per basic share of $1.52 and earnings per diluted share of $1.51 for the year ended December 31, 2021. This variance was largely due to charges related to Grain and a contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation this year, gains on property sales last year versus a loss on equipment sale this year, higher compensation and occupancy expenses and a reduction on the income on sale of mortgage loans. Interest and Dividend Income. Interest and dividend income increased $15.7 million, or 23.3%, to $82.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from $67.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Interest income on loans receivable, which is the Bank’s primary source of income, increased $4.3 million, or 6.6% to $69.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from $65.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Interest and dividend income on securities, FHLBNY stock and deposits due from banks increased $11.3 million, or 722.9%, to $12.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The following table presents interest income on loans receivable for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, Change 2022 2021 Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) 1-4 Family residential $ 21,406 $ 20,650 $ 756 3.7 % Multifamily residential 17,696 14,472 3,224 22.3 % Nonresidential properties 11,963 9,743 2,220 22.8 % Construction and land 10,443 8,256 2,187 26.5 % Business loans 4,860 9,444 (4,584 ) (48.5 %) Consumer loans 3,497 2,967 530 17.9 % Total interest income on loans receivable $ 69,865 $ 65,532 $ 4,333 6.6 % The following table presents interest and dividend income on securities and FHLBNY stock and deposits due from banks for the periods indicated: 59 For the Years Ended December 31, Change 2022 2021 Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) Interest on deposits due from banks $ 713 $ 20 $ 693 3,465.0 % Interest on securities 11,709 1,267 10,442 824.2 % Dividend on FHLBNY stock 465 279 186 66.7 % Total interest and dividend income $ 12,887 $ 1,566 $ 11,321 722.9 % Interest Expense. Interest expense increased $7.9 million, or 95.7%, to $16.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to lower market interest rates. For the Years Ended December 31, Change 2022 2021 Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) Certificates of deposit $ 3,477 $ 4,244 $ (767 ) (18.1 %) Money market 6,275 1,168 5,107 437.2 % Savings 128 146 (18 ) (12.3 %) NOW/IOLA 65 109 (44 ) (40.4 %) Advance payments by borrowers 5 4 1 25.0 % Borrowings 6,199 2,581 3,618 140.2 % Total interest expense $ 16,149 $ 8,252 $ 7,897 95.7 % Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased $7.8 million, or 13.2%, to $66.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from $58.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The $7.8 million increase in net interest income for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 was attributable to an increase of $15.7 million in interest and dividend income primarily due to increases in average loans receivable and interest and dividend on securities and FHLBNY stock and deposits due from banks, offset by an increase of $7.9 million in interest expense due primarily to a higher average cost of funds on interest bearing liabilities. Net interest rate spread decreased by 63 basis point to 3.27% for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 3.90% for the year ended December 31, 2021. The decrease in the net interest rate spread for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to an increase in the average rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities of 59 basis points to 1.39% for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 0.80% for the year ended December 31, 2021 and a decrease in the average yields on interest-earning assets of 4 basis points to 4.66% for the year ended December 31, 2022 from 4.70% for the year ended December 31, 2021. Net interest margin increased 38 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2022, to 3.75% from 4.13% for the year ended December 31, 2021, reflecting an increase in interest and the decrease in amortization of fee income from our PPP lending offset by our organic loan growth. The Federal Reserve raised the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4.50%-4.75% during its January 31, 2023 to February 1, 2023 meeting, the eighth consecutive rate hike since March 2022, and pushing borrowing costs to the highest level since 2007. The Federal Reserve has signaled that there will likely be additional federal funds interest rate increases. The recent increase and the anticipated increases are in response to inflation rising at a rate not seen in over 40 years. Because of this rising rate environment, the speed with which it is anticipated to be implemented, the significant competitive pressures in our markets and the potential negative impact of these factors on our deposit and loan pricing, our net interest margin may be negatively impacted. Our net interest income may also be negatively impacted if the demand for loans decreases due to the rate increases, alone or in tandem with the concurrent inflationary pressures. We may be negatively impacted if we are unable to appropriately time adjustments to our funding costs and the rates we earn on our loans. The Bank believes it is well positioned to withstand this rising interest rate environment in the near term as it is asset sensitive. 60 Non-Interest Income. Non-interest income decreased $28.2 million, or 81.5%, to $6.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from $34.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The following table presents non-interest income for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, Change 2022 2021 Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) Service charges and fees $ 1,830 $ 1,657 $ 173 10.4 % Brokerage commissions 1,020 1,324 (304 ) (23.0 %) Late and prepayment charges 623 1,207 (584 ) (48.4 %) Income on sale of mortgage loans 741 5,265 (4,524 ) (85.9 %) Loan origination 1,286 3,021 (1,735 ) (57.4 %) (Loss) gain on sale of premises and equipment (436 ) 20,270 (20,706 ) (102.2 %) Other 1,355 1,893 (538 ) (28.4 %) Total non-interest income $ 6,419 $ 34,637 $ (28,218 ) (81.5 %) Non-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense increased $28.7 million, or 50.2%, to $85.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2022 from $57.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was primarily due to an aggregate $16.9 million write-off and write-down related to the Grain Receivable, net of recoveries, $1.0 million write-off of the Company's investment in Grain, $5.0 million contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation and an increase of $4.7 million in compensation and benefits related to new hires and a reduction of nonrecurring expense amortization related to PPP loans. The following table presents non-interest expense for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, Change 2022 2021 Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) Compensation and benefits $ 27,914 $ 23,262 $ 4,652 20.0 % Occupancy and equipment 13,968 11,328 2,640 23.3 % Data processing expenses 3,779 3,015 764 25.3 % Direct loan expenses 2,487 3,888 (1,401 ) (36.0 %) Insurance and surety bond premiums 870 585 285 48.7 % Office supplies, telephone and postage 1,555 2,054 (499 ) (24.3 %) Professional fees 5,904 7,629 (1,725 ) (22.6 %) Contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation 4,995 — 4,995 — % Grain write-off and write-down 17,940 — 17,940 — % Marketing and promotional expenses 593 206 387 187.9 % Directors fees 368 285 83 29.1 % Regulatory assessment 337 323 14 4.3 % Other operating expenses 5,112 4,567 545 11.9 % Total non-interest expense $ 85,822 $ 57,142 $ 28,680 50.2 % Income Tax Provision. The Company had a benefit for income taxes of ($6.8) million for the year ended December 31, 2022 compared to a provision for income taxes of $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, resulting in effective tax rates of 18.6% and 24.4%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate is attributable to an increase of $5.6 million in the valuation allowance related to the unused non-deductible portion of the remaining charitable contribution deduction. 61 Average Balance Sheets The following table sets forth average outstanding balances, average yields and rates, and certain other information for the periods indicated. No tax-equivalent yield adjustments have been made, as the effects would be immaterial. Average balances are derived from average daily balances. Non-accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts, and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or interest expense. For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 Average Average Outstanding Average Outstanding Average Balance Interest Yield/Rate Balance Interest Yield/Rate (1) (Dollars in thousands) Interest-earning assets: Loans (1) $ 1,375,723 69,865 5.08 % $ 1,312,505 $ 65,532 4.99 % Securities (2) 357,446 11,709 3.28 % 62,908 1,267 2.01 % Other (3) 44,160 1,178 2.67 % 51,156 299 0.58 % Total interest-earning assets 1,777,329 82,752 4.66 % 1,426,569 67,098 4.70 % Non-interest-earning assets 164,324 89,152 Total assets $ 1,941,653 $ 1,515,721 Interest-bearing liabilities: NOW/IOLA $ 30,151 $ 65 0.22 % $ 30,851 $ 109 0.35 % Money market 393,555 6,275 1.59 % 310,611 1,168 0.38 % Savings 138,137 128 0.09 % 133,244 146 0.11 % Certificates of deposit 382,022 3,477 0.91 % 430,164 4,244 0.99 % Total deposits 943,865 9,945 1.05 % 904,870 5,667 0.63 % Advance payments by borrowers 11,514 5 0.04 % 10,106 4 0.04 % Borrowings 206,969 6,199 3.00 % 121,319 2,581 2.13 % Total interest-bearing liabilities 1,162,348 16,149 1.39 % 1,036,295 8,252 0.80 % Non-interest-bearing liabilities: Non-interest-bearing demand 344,505 — 287,008 — Other non-interest-bearing liabilities 33,225 — 17,763 — Total non-interest-bearing liabilities 377,730 — 304,771 — Total liabilities 1,540,078 16,149 1,341,066 8,252 Total equity 401,575 174,655 Total liabilities and total equity $ 1,941,653 1.39 % $ 1,515,721 0.80 % Net interest income $ 66,603 $ 58,846 Net interest rate spread (4) 3.27 % 3.90 % Net interest-earning assets (5) $ 614,981 $ 390,274 Net interest margin (6) 3.75 % 4.13 % Average interest-earning assets to interest-bearing liabilities 152.91 % 137.66 % 62 Rate/Volume Analysis The following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on the Company’s net interest income for the periods indicated. The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The total column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume.

The most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk because, as a financial institution, the majority of the Bank’s assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Therefore, a principal part of our operations is to manage interest rate risk and limit the exposure of its financial condition and results of operations to changes in market interest rates. The Bank’s Asset/Liability Management Committee is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in the Bank’s assets and liabilities, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate, given the business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with policies and guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. The Bank currently utilizes a third-party modeling solution that is prepared on a quarterly basis, to evaluate its sensitivity to changing interest rates, given the Bank’s business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. The Bank does not engage in hedging activities, such as engaging in futures, options or swap transactions, or investing in high-risk mortgage derivatives, such as collateralized mortgage obligation residual interests, real estate mortgage investment conduit residual interests or stripped mortgage backed securities. Mortgage World did not engage in hedging activities to cover the risks of interest rate movements while it held mortgages for sale. The then low mortgage interest rates and their limited volatility had effectively mitigated such risks. Net Interest Income Simulation Models . Management utilizes a respected, sophisticated third party designed asset liability modeling software that measures the Bank’s earnings through simulation modeling. Earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments are combined with forecasts of interest rates for the next 12 months and are combined with other factors in order to produce various earnings simulations over that same 12-month period. To limit interest rate risk, the Bank has policy guidelines for earnings risk which seek to limit the variance of net interest income in both gradual and instantaneous changes to interest rates. As of December 31, 2022, in the event of an instantaneous upward and downward change in rates from management's interest rate forecast over the next twelve months, assuming a static balance sheet, the following estimated changes are calculated: Net Interest Income Year 1 Change Rate Shift (1) Year 1 Forecast from Level (Dollars in thousands) +400 $ 61,821 (7.07%) +300 63,049 (5.22%) +200 64,168 (3.54%) +100 65,376 (1.72%) Level 66,521 — % -100 68,213 2.54% Although an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios, management believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Further, the earnings simulation model does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, and changing product spreads that could alter any potential adverse impact of changes in interest rates. The behavior of the deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios set out in the table above is a key assumption in the projected estimates of net interest income. The projected impact on net interest income in the table above assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternative rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher-yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce the benefit in those scenarios. At December 31, 2022, the earnings simulation model indicated that the Bank was in compliance with the Board of Directors approved Interest Rate Risk Policy. Economic Value of Equity Model . While earnings simulation modeling attempts to determine the impact of a changing rate environment to net interest income, the Economic Value of Equity Model (“EVE”) measures estimated changes to the economic values of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items as a result of interest rate changes. Economic values are determined by discounting expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items, which establishes a base case EVE. Rates are then shocked as prescribed by the Interest Rate Risk Policy to measure the sensitivity in EVE values for each of those shocked rate scenarios versus the base case. The Interest Rate Risk Policy sets limits for those sensitivities. At December 31, 2022, the EVE modeling calculated the following estimated changes in EVE due to instantaneous upward and downward changes in rates: 64 EVE as a Percentage of Present Value of Assets (3) Estimated Increase (Decrease) in Increase Change in Interest Estimated EVE EVE (Decrease) Rates (basis points) (1) EVE (2) Amount Percent Ratio (4) (basis points) (Dollars in thousands) +400 $ 406,087 $ (77,816 ) (16.08 %) 19.67 % (1,608 ) +300 425,907 (57,996 ) (11.99 %) 20.17 % (1,199 ) +200 445,802 (38,101 ) (7.87 %) 20.63 % (787 ) +100 465,702 (18,201 ) (3.76 %) 21.08 % (376 ) Level 483,903 — — % 21.43 % — -100 526,663 42,760 8.84 % 22.56 % 884 Although an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios, management believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Since EVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in EVE does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (i.e., the current year). Further, EVE does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships and changing product spreads that could alter the adverse impact of changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2022, the EVE model indicated that the Bank was in compliance with the Board of Directors approved Interest Rate Risk Policy. Most Likely Earnings Simulation Models . Management also analyzes a most-likely earnings simulation scenario that projects the expected change in rates based on a forward yield curve adopted by management using expected balance sheet volumes forecasted by management. Separate growth assumptions are developed for loans, investments, deposits, etc. Other interest rate scenarios analyzed by management may include delayed rate shocks, yield curve steepening or flattening, or other variations in rate movements to further analyze or stress the balance sheet under various interest rate scenarios. Each scenario is evaluated by management and weighted to determine the most likely result. These processes assist management to better anticipate financial results and, as a result, management may determine the need to review other operating strategies and tactics which might enhance results or better position the balance sheet to reduce interest rate risk going forward. Each of the above analyses may not, on its own, be an accurate indicator of how net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates. Income associated with interest-earning assets and costs associated with interest-bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates. In addition, the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates. In addition, certain assets, such as adjustable rate mortgage loans, have features (generally referred to as interest rate caps and floors) which limit changes in interest rates. Prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the maturity of certain instruments. The ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease during periods of rising interest rates. The Asset/Liability Committee reviews each of the above interest rate sensitivity analyses along with several different interest rate scenarios as part of its responsibility to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing and capital policies. Management's model governance, model implementation and model validation processes and controls are subject to review in the Bank’s regulatory examinations to ensure they are in compliance with the most recent regulatory guidelines and industry and regulatory practices. Management utilizes a respected, sophisticated third party designed asset liability modeling software to help ensure implementation of management's assumptions into the model are processed as intended in a robust manner. That said, there are numerous assumptions regarding financial instrument behaviors that are integrated into the model. The assumptions are formulated by combining observations gleaned from the Bank’s historical studies of financial instruments and the best estimations of how, if at all, these instruments may behave in the future given changes in economic conditions, technology, etc. These assumptions may prove to be 65 inaccurate. Additionally, given the large number of assumptions built into Bank’s asset liability modeling software, it is difficult, at best, to compare its results to other banks. The Asset/Liability Management Committee may determine that the Company should over time become more or less asset or liability sensitive depending on the underlying balance sheet circumstances and its conclusions regarding interest rate fluctuations in future periods. The historically low benchmark federal funds interest rate of the last several years implemented in response the turmoil resulting from COVID-19 pandemic has ended. The Federal Reserve Board increased the benchmark federal funds interest rate by 25 basis points its January 31, 2023 to February 1, 2023 mee ting . The Federal Reserve Board has signaled that there will likely be additional federal funds interest rate increases. The recent increase and the anticipated increases are in response to inflation rising at a rate not seen in over 40 years. Because of this rising rate environment, the speed with which it is anticipated to be implemented, the significant competitive pressures in our markets and the potential negative impact of these factors on our deposit and loan pricing, our net interest margin may be negatively impacted. Our net interest income may also be negatively impacted if the demand for loans decreases due to the rate increases, alone or in tandem with the concurrent inflationary pressures. We may be negatively impacted if we are unable to appropriately time adjustments to our funding costs and the rates we earn on our loans. The Bank believes it is well positioned to withstand this rising interest rate environment in the near term as it is asset sensitive. GAP Analysis . In addition, management analyzes interest rate sensitivity by monitoring the Bank’s interest rate sensitivity ""gap."" The interest rate sensitivity gap is the difference between the amount of interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing-liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets maturing or repricing during a period exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing during the same period, and a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing during a period exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets maturing or repricing during the same period. The following table sets forth the Company’s interest-earning assets and its interest-bearing liabilities at December 31, 2022, which are anticipated to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown based upon certain assumptions. The amounts of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to repricing or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability. The table sets forth an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at December 31, 2022, on the basis of contractual maturities, anticipated prepayments and scheduled rate adjustments. The loan amounts in the table reflect principal balances expected to be redeployed and/or repriced as a result of contractual amortization and as a result of contractual rate adjustments on adjustable-rate loans.

Modeling changes require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the net interest income and EVE tables presented assume that the composition of the interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the net interest income and EVE tables provide an indication of the interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on net interest income and EVE and will differ from actual results. Furthermore, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable-rate loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates both on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. In the event of changes in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the gap table. Interest rate risk calculations also may not reflect the fair values of financial instruments. For example, decreases in market interest rates can increase the fair values of loans, deposits and borrowings. 67 Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity describes the ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of the Company’s customers and to fund current and future planned expenditures. The primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and available-for-sale securities and proceeds from the sale of loans. The Bank also has access to borrow from the FHLBNY. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Bank had $517.4 million and $106.3 million, respectively, of term and overnight outstanding advances from the FHLBNY, and also had a guarantee from the FHLBNY through letters of credit of up to $21.5 million, both as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, there was eligible collateral of approximately $478.8 million and $362.3 million, respectively, in mortgage loans available to secure advances from the FHLBNY. The Bank also has two unsecured lines of credit totaling $90.0 million and $25.0 million with two correspondent banks, under which there was nothing outstanding at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The Bank did not have any outstanding securities sold under repurchase agreements with brokers as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. As of December 31, 2021, Mortgage World maintained two warehouse lines of credit with financial institutions for the purpose of funding the origination and sale of residential mortgage loans, with maximum credit lines of $30.0 million, of which $15.1 million was utilized, with $14.9 million remaining unused. As of December 31, 2022, Mortgage World was a division of the Bank and the Bank was funding these loans. Although maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by market interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. The most liquid assets are cash and interest-bearing deposits in banks. The levels of these assets are dependent on operating, financing, lending, and investing activities during any given period. Net cash provided by operating activities was $9.8 million and $18.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities, which consists primarily of disbursements for loan originations, purchases of new securities, and purchase of equipment offset by principal collections on loans, proceeds from maturing securities and pay downs on mortgage-backed securities, and proceeds from the sale of real estate was ($777.1) million and ($211.1) million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities, consisting of issuance of Preferred Stock, activities in deposit accounts, advances, contribution to the Ponce De Leon Foundation and repurchase and sale of shares as treasury stock, was $667.7 million and $274.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Based on the Company’s current assessment of the economic impact of rising interest rates, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and current global and regional market conditions on its borrowers, management has determined that these may be a detriment to borrowers’ ability to repay in the short-term and that the likelihood of long-term detrimental effects will depend significantly on the resolution of these factors and the resumption of normalized economic activities, a factor not yet determinable. The Bank’s management also took steps to enhance the Company’s liquidity position by increasing its on balance sheet cash and cash equivalents position in order to meet unforeseen liquidity events and to fund upcoming funding needs. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, all regulatory capital requirements were met, resulting in the Company and the Bank being categorized as well capitalized at December 31, 2022 and 2021. Management is not aware of any conditions or events that would change this categorization. Material Cash Requirements Commitments . As a financial services provider, the Company routinely is a party to various financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risks, such as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit. Although these contractual obligations represent the Company’s future cash requirements, a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. Such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans originated. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company had outstanding commitments to originate loans, and extend credit of $284.1 million and $220.5 million, respectively. It is anticipated that the Company will have sufficient funds available to meet its current lending commitments. Certificates of deposits that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from December 31, 2022 totaled $196.3 million. Management expects that a substantial portion of the maturing time deposits will be renewed. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits are not retained, the Company may utilize FHLBNY advances, unsecured credit lines with correspondent banks, or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest expense. Contractual Obligations . In the ordinary course of its operations, the Company enters into certain contractual obligations. Such obligations include data processing services, operating leases for premises and equipment, agreements with respect to borrowed funds and deposit liabilities. 68 The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2022 for the periods indicated below: For the Years Ending December 31, Total 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Thereafter (in thousands) Operating leases $ 47,211 $ 3,785 $ 3,833 $ 3,635 $ 3,422 $ 3,495 $ 29,041 Vendor obligations (1) 30,363 6,860 5,645 4,492 4,462 4,452 4,452 Advances from FHLBNY 511,375 178,375 50,000 50,000 — — 233,000 Certificates of deposit 376,618 196,342 49,457 41,169 42,165 47,485 — Total contractual obligation $ 965,567 $ 385,362 $ 108,935 $ 99,296 $ 50,049 $ 55,432 $ 266,493 (1) Amounts are for data processing services and service implementation. The obligations related to our uncertain tax positions, which are not considered material, have been excluded from the table above because of the uncertainty surrounding the timing and final amounts of settlement, if any. Other Material Cash Requirements. In addition to contractual obligations, the Company’s material cash requirements also includes compensation and benefits expenses for its employees, which were $27.9 million the year ended December 31, 2022. The Company also has material cash requirements for occupancy and equipment expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization of $1.8 million, related to rental expenses, general maintenance and cleaning supplies, guard services, software licenses and other miscellaneous expenses, which were $12.1 million the year ended December 31, 2022.

Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition of Ponce Financial Group, Inc., as the successor by merger with PDL Community Bancorp and Subsidiaries (the ""Company"") as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive (loss) income, stockholders’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the ""consolidated financial statements""). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America . Basis for Opinion These consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (""PCAOB"") and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion . Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Allowance for Loan Losses Critical Audit Matter Description As discussed in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s allowance for loan losses was approximately $34,592,000 as of December 31, 2022. The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses and consists of a specific and a general component for the allowance. The general allowance for loan losses is evaluated by segregating loans into homogenous pools and calculating a reserve based on historical loss experience adjusted by qualitative factors. The qualitative factors are evaluated on a regular basis by management and are based upon management’s periodic review of items including: changes in the nature, volume and terms of the portfolio; levels of and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans; effects of any changes in the quality of the loan review system; other changes in lending policies, procedures and practices; experience, ability and depth of lending management and staff; national and local economic trends and business conditions; industry conditions; change to the value of underlying collateral; and effects of changes in credit concentrations. Considering the significant estimation and judgment required by management in determining adjustments for loan losses, our audit of the allowance for loan losses and the related disclosures required a high degree of auditor judgment regarding the qualitative adjustments. 71 How the Critical Matter Was Addressed in the Audit Our audit procedures related to the allowance for loan loss included the following, among others: /s/ Mazars USA LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 2013.

The mortgage loan offices are located in Queens ( 2 ) and Brooklyn ( 1 ), New York and Bergenfield ( 1 ), New Jersey. The Company’s primary market area currently consists of the New York City metropolitan area. The Bank is a federally chartered stock savings association headquartered in the Bronx, New York. It was originally chartered in 1960 as a federally chartered mutual savings and loan association under the name Ponce De Leon Federal Savings and Loan Association. In 1985, the Bank changed its name to “Ponce De Leon Federal Savings Bank.” In 1997, the Bank changed its name again to “Ponce De Leon Federal Bank.” Upon the completion of its reorganization into a mutual holding company structure in September of 2017, the assets and liabilities of Ponce De Leon Federal Bank were transferred to and assumed by the Bank. The Bank is a MDI, a CDFI, and a certified SBA lender. The Bank is subject to comprehensive regulation and examination by the Office of Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”). The Bank’s business primarily consists of taking deposits from the general public and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings, in mortgage loans, consisting of one-to-four family residential (both investor-owned and owner-occupied), multifamily residential, nonresidential properties and construction and land, and, to a lesser extent, in business and consumer loans. The Bank also invests in securities, which have historically consisted of U.S. government and federal agency securities and securities issued by government-sponsored or owned enterprises, mortgage-backed securities and FHLBNY stock. The Bank offers a variety of deposit accounts, including demand, savings, money markets and certificates of deposit accounts. On July 10, 2020 , the Company completed its acquisition of Mortgage World . During the year ended December 31, 2021, Mortgage World was a mortgage banking entity subject to the regulation and examination of the New York State Department of Financial Services. The primary business of Mortgage World was the taking of applications from the general public for residential mortgage loans, underwriting them to investors’ standards, closing and funding them and holding them until they were sold to investors. Although Mortgage World was permitted to do business in various states (New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Florida and Connecticut), it primarily operated in the New York City metropolitan area. On January 26, 2022, Mortgage World transferred its assets and liabilities to Ponce Bank and ceased operating as an independent mortgage banking entity. Mortgage World’s business is now conducted as a division of Ponce Bank. Risks and Uncertainties: On February 24, 2022, Russian forces launched significant military action against Ukraine, and sustained conflict and disruption in the region continues. The impact to Ukraine as well as actions taken by other countries, including new and stricter sanctions imposed by Canada, the United Kingdom, the European Union, the U.S. and other countries and companies and organizations against officials, individuals, regions, and industries in Russia, and actions taken by Russia in response to such sanctions, and each country’s potential response to such sanctions, tensions, and military actions could have a material adverse effect on our operations. 79 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Inflation and interest rates may continue to adversely impact several industries within our geographic footprint and impair the ability of the Company’s customers to fulfill their contractual obligations to the Company. This could cause the Company to experience adverse effects on its business operations, loan portfolio, financial condition, and results of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2022, the provision for loan losses amounted to $ 24.0 million primarily due to reserves related to loans originated by Grain (see Note 5 for additional information related to Grain reserves) as well as increases in the loan portfolio. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: Use of Estimates : In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, as of the date of the consolidated statement of financial condition, and revenues and expenses for the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, the valuation of real estate acquired in connection with foreclosures or in satisfaction of loans, the valuation of loans held for sale, the valuation of deferred tax assets and investment securities and the estimates relating to the valuation for share-based awards. Significant Group Concentrations of Credit Risk : Most of the Bank's activities are with customers located within New York City. Accordingly, the ultimate collectability of a substantial portion of the Bank's loan portfolio and the ability of Mortgage World, a division of the Bank, to sell originated loans in the secondary markets are susceptible to changes in the local market conditions. Note 4 discusses the types of securities in which the Bank invests. Notes 5 and 13 discuss the types of lending that the Bank engages in, and other concentrations. Cash and Cash Equivalents : Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and amounts due from banks (including items in process of clearing). For purposes of reporting cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash flows from loans originated by the Company, interest-bearing deposits in financial institutions, and deposits are reported net. Included in cash and cash equivalents are restricted cash from escrows and good faith deposits. Escrows consist of U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) upfront mortgage insurance premiums and escrows on unsold mortgages that are held on behalf of borrowers. Good faith deposits consist of deposits received from commercial loan customers for use in various disbursements relating to the closing of a commercial loan. Restricted cash are included in cash and cash equivalents for purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows. Securities : Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the date individual investment securities are acquired, and the appropriateness of such classification is reassessed at each statement of financial condition date. Debt securities that management has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity, if any, are classified as ""held-to-maturity"" and recorded at amortized cost. Trading securities, if any, are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recognized in earnings. Securities not classified as held-to-maturity or trading, are classified as ""available-for-sale"" and recorded at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Purchase premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the terms of the securities. Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation. For securities in an unrealized loss position, management considers the extent and duration of the unrealized loss, and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer. Management also assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell, a security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the entire difference between amortized cost and fair value is recognized as impairment through earnings. For debt securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, the amount of impairment is split into two components as follows: 1) OTTI related to credit loss, which must be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and 2) OTTI related to other factors, which is recognized in other comprehensive income. The credit loss is defined as the difference between the discounted present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis. For equity securities, the entire amount of impairment is recognized through earnings. Gains and losses on the sale of securities are recorded on the trade date and are determined using the specific-identification method. The sale of a held-to-maturity security within three months of its maturity date or after collection of at least 85 % of the principal outstanding at the time the security was acquired is considered a maturity for purposes of classification and disclosure. Federal Home Loan Bank of New York Stock : The Bank is a member of the FHLBNY. Members are required to own a certain amount of stock based on the level of borrowings and other factors, and may invest in additional amounts. FHLBNY stock is carried at cost, 80 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements classified as a restricted security, and periodically evaluated for impairment based on ultimate recovery of par value. Both cash and stock dividends are reported as income. Loans Receivable : Loans receivable that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are stated at current unpaid principal balances, net of the allowance for loan losses and including net deferred loan origination fees and costs. Interest income is accrued based on the unpaid principal balance. Loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized in interest income using the interest method without anticipating prepayments. A loan is moved to nonaccrual status in accordance with the Company’s policy typically after 90 days of non-payment. The accrual of interest on mortgage and commercial loans is generally discontinued at the time the loan becomes 90 days past due unless the loan is well-secured and in process of collection. Consumer loans are typically charged-off no later than 90 days past due. Past due status is based on contractual terms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual status or charged-off if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. All nonaccrual loans are considered impaired loans. All interest accrued but not received for loans placed on nonaccrual are reversed against interest income. Interest received on such loans is accounted for on the cash basis or recorded against principal balances, until qualifying for return to accrual. Cash basis interest recognition is only applied on nonaccrual loans with a sufficient collateral margin to ensure no doubt with respect to the collectability of principal. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and remain current for a period of time (typically six months) and future payments are reasonably assured. Accrued interest receivable is closely monitored for collectability and will be charged-off in a timely manner if deemed uncollectable. Allowance for Loan Losses : The allowance for loan losses (“ALLL”) is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions, and other factors. Allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management’s judgment, should be charged-off. The Company’s assessment of its loan portfolio, including Grain, and the economic impact of inflation and increased interest rates on borrowers indicates that it is likely that such conditions will be a detriment to their ability to repay in the short-term and that the likelihood of long-term detrimental effects depends significantly on the resumption of normalized economic activities, a factor not yet determinable. The allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Loans for which the terms have been modified resulting in a concession, and for which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, are considered troubled debt restructurings and classified as impaired. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower’s prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. Impaired loans are measured for impairment using the fair value of the collateral, present value of cash flows, or the observable market price of the note. Impairment measurement for all collateral dependent loans, excluding accruing troubled debt restructurings, is based on the fair value of collateral, less costs to sell, if necessary. A loan is considered collateral dependent if repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely by the sale or the operation of the underlying collateral. When a loan is modified to troubled debt restructuring, management evaluates for any possible impairment using either the discounted cash flows method, where the value of the modified loan is based on the present value of expected cash flows, discounted at the contractual interest rate of the original loan agreement, or by using the fair value of the collateral less selling costs, if repayment under the modified terms becomes doubtful. The general component covers non‑impaired loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors. The historical loss experience is determined by portfolio segment and is based on the actual loss history experienced over a rolling 12 quarter average 81 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements period, except for loans originated by Grain where the Bank uses one fiscal quarter. This actual loss experience is supplemented with other economic factors based on the risks present for each portfolio segment. These economic factors include consideration of the following: levels of and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans; levels of and trends in charge-offs and recoveries; trends in volume and terms of loans; effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards; other changes in lending policies, procedures, and practices; experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff; national and local economic trends and conditions; industry conditions; and, effects of changes in credit concentrations. When establishing the allowance for loan losses, management categorizes loans into risk categories reflecting individual borrower earnings, liquidity, leverage and cash flow, as well as the nature of underlying collateral. These risk categories and relevant risk characteristics are as follows: Residential and Multifamily Mortgage Loans : Residential and multifamily mortgage loans are secured by first mortgages. These loans are typically underwritten with loan-to-value ratios ranging from 65 % to 90 %. The primary risks involved in residential mortgages are the borrower’s loss of employment, or other significant event, that negatively impacts the source of repayment. Additionally, a serious decline in home values could jeopardize repayment in the event that the underlying collateral needs to be liquidated to pay-off the loan . Nonresidential Mortgage Loans : Nonresidential mortgage loans are primarily secured by commercial buildings, office and industrial buildings, warehouses, small retail shopping centers and various special purpose properties, including hotels, restaurants and nursing homes. These loans are typically underwritten at no more than 75 % loan-to-value ratio. Although terms vary, commercial real estate loans generally have amortization periods of 15 to 30 years, as well as balloon payments of 10 to 15 years, and terms which provide that the interest rates are adjusted on a 5 -year schedule. Construction and Land Loans : Construction real estate loans consist of vacant land and property that is in the process of improvement. Repayment of these loans can be dependent on the sale of the property to third parties or the successful completion of the improvements by the builder for the end user. In the event a loan is made on property that is not yet improved for the planned development, there is the risk that government approvals will not be granted or will be delayed. Construction loans also run the risk that improvements will not be completed on time or in accordance with specifications and projected costs. Construction real estate loans generally have terms of six months to two years during the construction period with fixed rates or interest rates based on a designated index. Business Loans : Business loans are loans for commercial, corporate and business purposes, including issuing letters of credit. These loans are secured by business assets or may be unsecured and repayment is directly dependent on the successful operation of the borrower’s business and the borrower’s ability to convert the assets to operating revenue. They possess greater risk than most other types of loans because the repayment capacity of the borrower may become inadequate. Business loans generally have terms of five to seven years or less and interest rates that float in accordance with a designated published index. Substantially all such loans are backed by the personal guarantees of the owners of the business. Consumer Loans : Consumer loans generally have higher interest rates than mortgage loans. The risk involved in consumer loans is the type and nature of the collateral and, in certain cases, the absence of collateral. Consumer loans include passbook loans and other secured and unsecured loans that have been made for a variety of consumer purposes. Included in consumer loans are loans originated by Grain. Mortgage Loans Held for Sale, at Fair Value : Mortgage loans held for sale, at fair value, include residential mortgages that were originated in accordance with secondary market pricing and underwriting standards. These loans are loans originated by the Bank’s Mortgage World division and the Company intends to sell these loans on the secondary market. Mortgage loans held for sale are carried at fair value under the fair value option accounting guidance for financial assets and financial liabilities. The gains or losses for the changes in fair value of these loans are included in income on sale of mortgage loans on the consolidated statements of operations. Interest income on mortgage loans held for sale measured under the fair value option is calculated based on the principal amount of the loan and is included in interest loans receivable on the consolidated statements of operations . 82 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Derivative Financial Instruments : The Company, through the Bank’s Mortgage World division, uses derivative financial instruments as a part of its price risk management activities. All such derivative financial instruments are designated as free-standing derivative instruments. In accordance with FASB ASC 815-25, Derivatives and Hedging , all derivative instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at their fair value. Change in the fair value of these derivatives is reported in current period earnings. Additionally, to facilitate the sale of mortgage loans, the Bank, through its Mortgage World division, may enter into forward sale positions on securities, and mandatory delivery positions. Exposure to losses or gains on these positions is limited to the net difference between the calculated amounts to be received and paid. As of December 31, 2022 , the Company did not enter into any forward sale or mandatory delivery positions on their financial instruments. Revenue from Contracts with Customers : The Company’s revenue from contracts with customers in the scope of ASC 606, Revenue from Contract with Customers , is recognized within noninterest income. ASC 606 outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. Management determined the revenue streams impacted by ASC 606 included those related to service charges on deposit accounts, ATM and card fees and other services fees. The Company’s revenue recognition pattern for these revenue streams did not change from current practice. The Company's primary sources of revenue are interest income on financial assets and income from mortgage banking activities, which are explicitly excluded from the scope of ASC 606. Transfers of Financial Assets : Transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when all of the components meet the definition of a participating interest and when control over the assets has been surrendered. A participating interest generally represents (1) a proportionate (pro rata) ownership interest in an entire financial asset, (2) a relationship where from the date of transfer all cash flows received from the entire financial asset are divided proportionately among the participating interest holders in an amount equal to their share of ownership, (3) the priority of cash flows has certain characteristics, including no reduction in priority, subordination of interest, or recourse to the transferor other than standard representation or warranties, and (4) no party has the right to pledge or exchange the entire financial asset unless all participating interest holders agree to pledge or exchange the entire financial asset. Control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when (1) the assets have been isolated from the Bank, (2) the transferee obtains the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets, and (3) the Bank does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through either (a) an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity or (b) the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specific assets, other than through a clean-up call. Premises and Equipment: Premises and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed and charged to operations using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets as follows: Years Building 39 Building improvements 15 - 39 Furniture, fixtures and equipment 3 - 10 Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the improvements’ estimated economic lives or the related lease terms, including extensions expected to be exercised. Gains and losses on dispositions are recognized upon realization. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred and improvements are capitalized. Leasehold improvements in process are not amortized until the assets are placed in operation. Impairment of Long-Lived Assets : Long-lived assets, assets, including premises and leasehold improvements, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If impairment is indicated by that review, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value through a charge to noninterest expense. Leases : The Company leases office space and certain equipment under non-cancellable operating lease agreements and determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. The Company does not currently have any financing lease arrangements. Right of use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right of use assets are recognized on the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term adjusted for initial direct costs, if any, and lease incentives received or deemed probable of being received. The Company uses the rate implicit in the lease if it is readily determinable or otherwise the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate. The implicit rates of Company leases are not readily determinable and accordingly, the 83 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the commencement date for all leases. The Company's incremental borrowing rate for a lease is the rate of interest it would have to pay on a collateralized basis to borrow an amount equal to the lease payments under similar terms and in a similar economic environment. The Company uses its FHLBNY borrowing rate based on the information available on the commencement date plus a spread of 2.50 % in determining the present value of lease payments. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in “Occupancy and equipment” in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Some of the Company’s lease agreements include rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation which are accounted for as variable lease amounts but are not reflected as a component of the Company’s lease liability. Certain leases also require the Company to pay real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses associated with the leased premises or equipment which are also not reflected as a component of the Company’s lease liability Other Real Estate Owned : Other Real Estate Owned (“OREO”) represents properties acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure or other proceedings. OREO is initially recorded at fair value, less estimated disposal costs, at the date of foreclosure, which establishes a new cost basis. After foreclosure, the properties are held for sale and are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, less estimated costs of disposal. Any write-down to fair value, at the time of transfer to OREO, is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Properties are evaluated regularly to ensure that the recorded amounts are supported by current fair values and charges against earnings are recorded as necessary to reduce the carrying amount to fair value, less estimated costs to dispose. Costs relating to the development and improvement of the property are capitalized, subject to the limit of fair value of the OREO, while costs relating to holding the property are expensed. Gains or losses are included in operations upon disposal. Income Taxes : The Company recognizes income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income, in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the consolidated financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 % likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. Interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits, if any, would be classified as additional provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations. Related Party Transactions : Directors and officers of the Company and their affiliates have been customers of and have had transactions with the Company, and it is expected that such persons will continue to have such transactions in the future. Management believes that all deposit accounts, loans, services and commitments comprising such transactions were made in the ordinary course of business, on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other customers who are not directors or officers. In the opinion of management, the transactions with related parties did not involve more than normal risk of collectability, nor favored treatment or terms, nor present other unfavorable features. Note 17 contains details regarding related party transactions. Employee Benefit Plans: The Company maintains a KSOP, an Employee Stock Ownership Plan with 401(k) provisions incorporated, a Long-Term Incentive Plan that includes grants of restricted stock units and stock options, and a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the “SERP”). 84 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements KSOP, the Employee Stock Ownership Plan with 401(k) Provisions: Compensation expense is recorded as shares are committed to be released with a corresponding credit to unearned KSOP equity account at the average fair market value of the shares during the period and the shares become outstanding for earnings per share computations. Compensation expense is recognized ratably over the service period based upon management’s estimate of the number of shares expected to be allocated by the KSOP. The difference between the average fair market value and the cost of the shares allocated by the KSOP is recorded as an adjustment to additional paid-in-capital. Unallocated common shares held by the Company’s KSOP are shown as a reduction in stockholders’ equity and are excluded from weighted-average common shares outstanding for both basic and diluted earnings per share calculations until they are committed to be released. The 401(k) provisions provide for elective employee/participant deferrals of income. Discretionary matching, profit-sharing, and safe harbor contributions, not to exceed 4 % of employee compensation and profit-sharing contributions may be provided. Stock Options: The Company recognizes the value of shared-based payment transactions as compensation costs in the financial statements over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award. The fair value of the share-based payments for stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur during the period. Restricted Stock Units: The Company recognizes compensation cost related to restricted stock units based on the market price of the stock units at the grant date over the vesting period. The product of the number of units granted and the grant date market price of the Company’s common stock determines the fair value of restricted stock units. The Company recognizes compensation expense for the fair value of the restricted stock units on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Comprehensive Income : Comprehensive (loss) income consists of net (loss) income and other comprehensive (loss) income, which are both recognized as separate components of stockholder’s equity. Other comprehensive (loss) income includes unrealized gains and losses on securities available-for-sale. Loss Contingencies : Loss contingencies, including claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business, are recorded as liabilities when the likelihood of loss is probable and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. Management does not believe there are any such matters that will have a material effect on the operations and financial position of the Company. Fair Value of Financial Instruments : Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Fair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions, as more fully disclosed in Note 14. Fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding interest rates, credit risk, prepayments, and other factors, especially in the absence of broad markets for particular items. Changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect these estimates. Segment : Operating segments are defined as components of an entity for which separate financial information is available and that is regularly reviewed by the Chief Operating Decision Maker (the “CODM”) in deciding how to allocate resources to an individual segment and in assessing performance. The Company’s Chief Executive Officer is the Company’s CODM. The CODM reviews financial information presented on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions, allocating resources, and evaluating financial performance. As such, the Company has determined that it operates as one operating segment and one reportable segment. Loan Commitments and Related Financial Instruments : Financial instruments include off‑balance sheet credit instruments, such as commitments to make loans and commercial letters of credit, issued to meet customer financing needs. The face amount for these items represents the exposure to loss, before considering customer collateral or ability to repay. Such financial instruments are recorded when they are funded. Earnings (Loss) per Share (“EPS”) : Basic EPS represents net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders divided by the basic weighted average common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders by the basic weighted average common shares outstanding, plus the effect of potential dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during the period. Basic weighted common shares outstanding is weighted average common shares outstanding less weighted average unallocated ESOP shares. Treasury Stock : Shares repurchased under the Company’s share repurchase programs were purchased in open-market transactions and are held as treasury stock. The Company accounts for treasury stock under the cost method and includes treasury stock as a component of stockholders’ equity. 85 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Reclassification of Prior Year Presentation: Certain prior periods amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current period presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the reporting results of operations and did not affect previously reported amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards Updates (""ASU"") In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842).” This ASU requires all lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset, measured at the present value of the future minimum lease payments, at the lease commencement date. Lessor accounting remains largely unchanged under the new guidance. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period, for public business entities. The Company took advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards as an EGC, and it adopted the amendments in this update for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company has evaluated the amended guidance including the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements. The Company has identified its leased office spaces and equipment as within the scope of the guidance. The Company currently leases its administrative office and 15 branches and mortgage offices and the new guidance resulted in the establishment of a right to use asset of $ 36.2 million and corresponding lease obligations of $ 36.7 million. The Company is utilizing a new lease accounting tool to assist in the computations of its right to use asset and corresponding lease obligations for the operating leases. The Company has adopted this standard on December 31, 2022, effective January 1, 2022 . Recent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted: As an emerging growth company (“EGC”) as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, the Company had elected to use the extended transition period to delay the adoption of new or reissued accounting pronouncements applicable to public business entities until such pronouncements are made applicable to nonpublic business entities. The Company has exited the EGC status as of December 31, 2022. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “ Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” This ASU significantly changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. The standard is to replace today’s “incurred loss” approach with an “expected loss” model. The new model, referred to as the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) model, is to apply to: (1) financial assets subject to credit losses and measured at amortized cost, and (2) certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. This includes, but is not limited to, loans, leases, held-to-maturity securities, loan commitments and financial guarantees. The CECL model does not apply to available-for-sale (“AFS”) debt securities. For AFS debt securities with unrealized losses, entities will measure credit losses in a manner similar to what they do today, except that the losses will be recognized as allowances rather than reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. As a result, entities will recognize improvements to estimated credit losses immediately in earnings rather than as interest income over time, as they do today. The ASU also reportedly simplifies the accounting model for purchased credit-impaired debt, securities and loans. ASU 2016-13 also expands the disclosure requirements regarding an entity’s assumptions, models and methods for estimating the allowance for loan and lease losses. In addition, entities will need to disclose the amortized cost balance for each class of financial asset by credit quality indicator, disaggregated by the year of origination. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years, for public business entities, that are not deemed to be smaller reporting companies as defined by the SEC as of November 15, 2019. The Company took advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standard as an EGC, and adopted this accounting standards and applied the standard’s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of January 1, 2023. The Company has evaluated the amended guidance including the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements. As a result of the required change in approach toward determining estimated credit losses from the current “incurred loss” model to one based on estimated cash flows over a loan’s contractual life, adjusted for prepayments (a “life of loan” model), the Company expects that the new guidance might result in an increase in the allowance for loan losses, particularly for longer duration loan portfolios. The Company also notes that the new guidance will result in an allowance for held-to-maturity debt securities. Upon adoption, the Company anticipates that it would decrease the allowance to approximately $ 31.5 million for the loan portfolio and add a $ 0.7 million allowance to the held-to-maturity securities portfolio. In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) . ” This ASU provides optional means and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference LIBOR or other reference rates expected to be discontinued because of the reference rate reform. The amendments in this ASU are effective for all entities as of March 86 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company believes this update will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, "" Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326) . ” This ASU eliminates troubled debt restructuring guidance for organizations that adopted the amendments in ASU 2016-13 while providing for additional disclosures for loan modifications. This new guidance introduces new disclosure requirements for modifications of receivables to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty. Creditors should evaluate all modifications as either a new loan or continuation of an existing loan under the general guidance on loan refinancing and restructuring in ASC 310-20-35-9 through 35-11. The Company continues to evaluate the impact of the guidance, including determining whether new modifications exist that are deemed to be in scope and subsequent related accounting standard updates. Note 2. Preferred Stock Issuance; Plan of Conversion and Stock Offering Preferred Stock Issuance On June 7, 2022, the Company‎ closed a private placement (the “Private Placement”) of 225,000 shares of the Company’s Senior Non-Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock, Series A‎, par value $ 0.01 (the “Preferred Stock”) for an aggregate purchase price equal to $ 225.0 million in cash, to the United States Department of the Treasury (the “Treasury”) pursuant to the Emergency Capital Investment Program (“ECIP”).‎ The holders of the Preferred Stock will be entitled to a dividend payable in cash quarterly at an annual rate dependent on certain factors as reported by the Company to Treasury in a quarterly supplemental report. The initial dividend rate is zero percent for the first two years after issuance, and thereafter the floor dividend rate is 0.50 % and the ceiling dividend rate is 2.00 %. After 10 years of issuance, the perpetual dividend rate in effect, will be determined based on said floor and ceiling. The actual dividend rate that will be paid by the Company on the Preferred Stock cannot be determined at this time. The ECIP investment by the Treasury is part of a program to invest over $ 8.7 billion into Community Development Financial Institution (“CDFI”) or ‎Minority Depository Institution (“MDI”), of which Ponce Bank is both. The ECIP is intended to incentivize CDFIs and MDIs to provide loans, grants, ‎and forbearance to small businesses, minority-owned businesses, and consumers in low-income and underserved communities that may have been ‎disproportionately impacted by the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.‎ In the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, the Preferred Stock will be entitled to a liquidation preference, subject to certain limitations, in the amount of the sum of $ 1,000 per share plus declared and unpaid dividends (without accumulation of undeclared dividends) on each share.

Ponce Financial Group, Inc.’s common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Global Market under the same trading symbol “PDLB” on January 28, 2022. As a result of the conversion and reorganization, each issued and outstanding share of PDL Community Bancorp common stock was converted into the right to receive 1.3952 shares of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock. Cash was paid in lieu of any fractional shares based on the sale price in the offering of $ 10.00 per share. Ponce Financial Group Inc.’s total issued and outstanding shares on January 28, 2022 was 24,711,834 shares. All shares of treasury stock of PDL Community Bancorp were eliminated on January 27, 2022. 87 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements On January 27, 2022, the Company made $ 5.0 million in contributions to the Ponce De Leon Foundation as part of the conversion and reorganization, which is included in the non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2022, in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations.

As of January 27, 2022, these funds were reclassified as proceeds from the sale of the Company’s common stock. Note 3. Restrictions on Cash and Due From Banks The Bank was previously required to maintain reserve balances in cash or on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank, based on a percentage of deposits.

The unrealized losses related to the Company debt securities were issued by U.S. government-sponsored entities and agencies. The Company does not believe that the debt securities that were in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2022 represents a credit loss impairment. The gross unrealized loss positions related to mortgage-backed securities and other obligations issued by the U.S government agencies or U.S. government-sponsored enterprises carry the explicit and/or implicit guarantee of the U.S. government and have a long history of zero credit loss. Total gross unrealized losses were primarily attributable to changes in interest rates relative to when the investment securities were purchased and not due to the credit quality of the investment securities. 90 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements The following is a summary of maturities of securities at December 31, 2022 and 2021.

The Company primarily grants loans secured by real estate to individuals and businesses pursuant to an established credit policy applicable to each type of lending activity in which it engages. Although collateral provides assurance as a secondary source of repayment, the Company ordinarily requires the primary source of repayment to be based on the borrowers’ ability to generate continuing cash flows. The Company also evaluates the collateral and creditworthiness of each customer. The credit policy provides that depending on the borrowers’ creditworthiness and type of collateral, credit may be extended up to predetermined percentages of the market value of the collateral or on an unsecured basis. Real estate is the primary form of collateral. Other important forms of collateral are time deposits and marketable securities. For disclosures related to the allowance for loan losses and credit quality, the Company does not have any disaggregated classes of loans below the segment level. Credit-Quality Indicators : Internally assigned risk ratings are used as credit-quality indicators, which are reviewed by management on a quarterly basis. The objectives of the Company’s risk-rating system are to provide the Board of Directors and senior management with an objective assessment of the overall quality of the loan portfolio, to promptly and accurately identify loans with well-defined credit weaknesses so that timely action can be taken to minimize credit loss, to identify relevant trends affecting the collectability of the loan portfolio, to isolate potential problem areas and to provide essential information for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Below are the definitions of the Company's internally assigned risk ratings: Strong Pass – Loans to new or existing borrowers collateralized at least 90 percent by an unimpaired deposit account at the Company. Good Pass – Loans to a new or existing borrower in a well-established enterprise in excellent financial condition with strong liquidity and a history of consistently high level of earnings, cash flow and debt service capacity. Satisfactory Pass – Loans to a new or existing borrower of average strength with acceptable financial condition, satisfactory record of earnings and sufficient historical and projected cash flow to service the debt. Performance Pass – Loans that evidence strong payment history but document less than average strength, financial condition, record of earnings, or projected cash flows with which to service debt. Special Mention – Loans in this category are currently protected but show one or more potential weaknesses and risks which may inadequately protect collectability or borrower’s ability to meet repayment terms at some future date if the weakness or weaknesses are not monitored or remediated. Substandard – Loans that are inadequately protected by the repayment capacity of the borrower or the current sound net worth of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans in this category have well defined weaknesses and risks that jeopardize their repayment. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that some loss may be sustained if the deficiencies are not remedied. Doubtful – Loans that have all the weaknesses of loans classified as “Substandard” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of current existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. 93 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Loans within the top four categories above are considered pass rated, as commonly defined. Risk ratings are assigned as necessary to differentiate risk within the portfolio.

Impaired loans, including troubled debt restructurings, are identified by applying normal loan review procedures in accordance with the allowance for loan losses methodology. Management periodically assesses loans to determine whether impairment exists. Any loan that is, or will potentially be, no longer performing in accordance with the terms of the original loan contract is evaluated to determine impairment. 96 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements The following information relates to impaired loans as of and for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020: Unpaid Contractual Recorded Investment Recorded Investment Total Average Interest Income Principal With No With Recorded Related Recorded Recognized As of and For the Year Ended December 31, 2022 Balance Allowance Allowance Investment Allowance Investment on a Cash Basis (in thousands) Mortgage loans: 1-4 Family residential $ 9,986 $ 7,827 $ 1,757 $ 9,584 $ 159 $ 11,072 $ 307 Multifamily residential — — — — — 630 — Nonresidential properties 843 457 344 801 37 1,930 30 Construction and land 7,567 7,567 — 7,567 — 6,408 — Nonmortgage loans: Business — — — — — 3 — Consumer — — — — — — Total $ 18,396 $ 15,851 $ 2,101 $ 17,952 $ 196 $ 20,043 $ 337 Unpaid Contractual Recorded Investment Recorded Investment Total Average Interest Income Principal With No With Recorded Related Recorded Recognized As of and For the Year Ended December 31, 2021 Balance Allowance Allowance Investment Allowance Investment on a Cash Basis (in thousands) Mortgage loans: 1-4 Family residential $ 13,333 $ 10,535 $ 1,991 $ 12,526 $ 205 $ 12,145 $ 189 Multifamily residential 1,200 1,200 — 1,200 — 1,139 63 Nonresidential properties 3,494 2,637 358 2,995 38 3,941 38 Construction and land 917 917 — 917 — 307 17 Nonmortgage loans: Business 13 13 — 13 — 13 — Consumer — — — — — 24 — Total $ 18,957 $ 15,302 $ 2,349 $ 17,651 $ 243 $ 17,569 $ 307 Unpaid Contractual Recorded Investment Recorded Investment Total Average Interest Income Principal With No With Recorded Related Recorded Recognized As of and For the Year Ended December 31, 2020 Balance Allowance Allowance Investment Allowance Investment on a Cash Basis (in thousands) Mortgage loans: 1-4 Family residential $ 14,118 $ 10,613 $ 2,609 $ 13,222 $ 252 $ 12,306 $ 321 Multifamily residential 946 946 — 946 — 231 34 Nonresidential properties 5,632 4,813 371 5,184 40 5,339 33 Construction and land — — — — — 405 — Nonmortgage loans: — Business — — — — — 8 — Consumer — — — — — — — Total $ 20,696 $ 16,372 $ 2,980 $ 19,352 $ 292 $ 18,289 $ 388 The loan portfolio also includes certain loans that have been modified to troubled debt restructurings. Under applicable standards, loans are modified to troubled debt restructurings when a creditor, for economic or legal reasons related to a debtor’s financial condition, grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider, unless it results in a delay in payment that is insignificant. These concessions could include a reduction of interest rate on the loan, payment and maturity extensions, forbearance, or other actions intended to maximize collections. When a loan is modified to a troubled debt restructuring, management evaluates for any possible impairment using either the discounted cash flows method, where the value of the modified loan is based on the present value of expected 97 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements cash flows, discounted at the contractual interest rate of the original loan agreement, or by using the fair value of the collateral less selling costs if repayment under the modified terms becomes doubtful. If management determines that the value of the modified loan in a troubled debt restructuring is less than the recorded investment in the loan, impairment is recognized through a specific allowance estimate or charge-off to the allowance for loan losses. During the year ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 , there were no loans restructured as a troubled debt restructuring. At December 31, 2022 , there were 23 troubled debt restructured loans totaling $ 6.6 million of which $ 4.2 million are on accrual status. At December 31, 2021 , there were 30 troubled debt restructured loans totaling $ 8.7 million of which $ 6.2 million are on accrual status. There were no commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers whose loans have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring. The financial impact from the concessions made represents specific impairment reserves on these loans, which aggregated to $ 0.2 million and $ 0.3 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Mortgage Loans Held for Sale, at Fair Value At December 31, 2022 and 2021 , 4 loans and 27 loans related to Mortgage World in the amount of $ 2.0 million and $ 15.8 million, respectively, were held for sale and accounted for under the fair value option accounting guidance for financial assets and financial liabilities. Write-off and write-down of Microloans In 2020, the Company entered into a business arrangement with the FinTech startup company Grain. Grain’s product is a mobile application geared to the underbanked, minorities and new generations entering the financial services market. In employing this mobile application, the Bank uses non-traditional underwriting methodologies to provide revolving credit to borrowers who otherwise may gravitate to using alternative non-bank lenders. Under the terms of its agreement with Grain, the Bank is the lender for Grain-originated microloans with credit lines currently up to $ 1,500 and, where applicable, the depository for related security deposits. Grain originates and services these microloans and is responsible for maintaining compliance with the Bank's origination and servicing standards, as well as applicable regulatory and legal requirements. If a microloan is found to be fraudulent or defaults due to a failure of Grain to properly service the microloan, the Bank’s applicable standards for origination or servicing are deemed to have not been complied with and the microloan is put back to Grain, who then becomes responsible for the microloan and any related losses. The microloans put back to Grain are accounted for as an “other asset,” specifically referred to herein as the “Grain Receivable.” The Bank, pursuant to its agreement with Grain, at December 31, 2021, had 59,180 microloans outstanding, net of put backs, with credit extensions aggregating $ 33.9 million. Of these microloans, the Bank estimates that 80 percent have been made in low- and low-to-moderate income census tracts with an estimated 56 percent made to minority borrowers. In establishing these lines of credit, the Company reserved the right to modify borrowers’ credit limits at its sole discretion. The Company continues to balance its risks as needed and continues to support a wide base of customers. Based on the overall performance of the Grain portfolio, as well as current economic factors, the Company reduced the amount of credit available to Grain application customers on a uniform and program-wide basis, with each borrower’s credit limit reduced to the amount that was outstanding under that borrower’s line of credit. The Company also reserved the right to make further modifications to credit limits as it may deem appropriate under the circumstances, whether on a program-wide or individual basis. No new loans were made by the Company after May 31, 2022. At December 31, 2022 , the Bank had 27,886 Grain microloans outstanding, net of put backs, with an aggregate balance totaling $ 18.2 million and which were performing, in management’s opinion, comparably to similar portfolios, offset by a $ 15.4 million allowance for loan losses, resulting in $ 2.8 million in Grain microloans, net of allowance for loan losses. Since the beginning of the Bank’s agreement with Grain and through December 31, 2022 , 45,322 microloans amounting to $ 25.5 million have been deemed to be fraudulent and put back to Grain. The Company has written-down a total of $ 17.5 million of the Grain Receivable for the year ended December 31, 2022 and received $ 6.2 million in cash from Grain and through the application of security deposits connected to fraudulent loan accounts. The Bank also opted to use the $ 1.8 million grant it received from the U.S. Treasury Department’s Rapid Response ‎Program to defray the Grain Receivable. The application of those amounts resulted in no net receivable. Additionally, the Company has written-off its equity investment in Grain of $ 1.0 million. As of December 31, 2022 , the Company’s total exposure to Grain was $ 2.8 million of the remaining microloans, net of allowance for loan losses, excluding $0.4 million of unused commitments available to Grain borrowers and $ 1.4 million of security deposits by Grain borrowers. The $ 16.9 million write-off and write-down net of $ 0.5 million of recoveries for the year ended December 31, 2022 is included in non-interest expense in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. 98 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Grain Technologies, Inc.

Note 9. Borrowings FHLBNY Advances : As a member of FHLBNY, the Bank has the ability to borrow from the FHLBNY based on a certain percentage of the value of the Bank's qualified collateral, as defined in FHLBNY Statement of Credit Policy, at the time of the borrowing. In accordance with an agreement with FHLBNY, the qualified collateral must be free and clear of liens, pledges and encumbrances.

Additionally, the Bank had two unsecured lines of credit in the amount of $ 90.0 million and $ 25.0 million with two correspondent banks, under which there was no thing outstanding at December 31, 2022 and 2021 , respectively. The Bank also had a guarantee from the FHLBNY through letters of credit of up to $ 21.5 million each at December 31, 2022 and 2021. Borrowed funds at December 31, 2022 and 2021 consist of the following and are summarized by maturity and call date below: December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 Scheduled Maturity Redeemable at Call Date Weighted Average Rate Scheduled Maturity Redeemable at Call Date Weighted Average Rate (Dollars in thousands) FHLBNY Overnight line of credit advance $ 6,000 $ 6,000 4.61 % $ — $ — — % FHLBNY Term advances ending: 2022 $ — $ — — $ 77,880 $ 77,880 1.73 % 2023 178,375 178,375 4.32 28,375 28,375 2.82 2024 50,000 50,000 4.75 — — — 2025 50,000 50,000 4.41 — — — 2026 — — — — — — Thereafter 233,000 233,000 3.27 — — — $ 517,375 $ 517,375 3.90 % $ 106,255 $ 106,255 2.02 % Interest expense on FHLBNY term advances totaled $ 5.4 million, $ 2.2 million and $ 2.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 , respectively.

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021 , the Bank had eligible collateral of approximately $ 478.8 million and $ 362.3 million, respectively, in residential 1-4 family and multifamily mortgage loans available to secure advances from the FHLBNY. 102 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Warehouse Lines of Credit: Mortgage World maintained two warehouse lines of credit with financial institutions for the purpose of funding the originations and sale of residential mortgages. The lines of credit were repaid with proceeds from the sale of the mortgage loans. The lines were secured by the assets collateralizing underlying mortgages. The agreements with the warehouse lenders provided for certain restrictive covenants such as minimum net worth and liquidity ratios for Mortgage World. As of December 31, 2021, Mortgage World was in full compliance with all financial covenants. Warehouse Line of Credit #1 The interest rate is based on the 30-day LIBOR rate plus 3.25 %. The effective rate at December 31, 2021 was 3.35 %. On December 31, 2022, the unused line of credit was $ 10.0 million. This warehouse line of credit was terminated on February 7, 2023 . Warehouse Line of Credit #2 The interest rate is based on the 30-day LIBOR rate plus 3.00 % for loans funded. The effective rate at December 31, 2021 was 3.10 %. The warehouse line of credit was terminated on March 31, 2022 . Total interest expense on warehouse lines of credit totaled $ 0.1 million and $ 0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. December 31, 2021 Credit Line Unused Line Maximum of Credit Balance (in thousands) Warehouse Line of Credit #1 $ 15,000 $ 8,636 $ 6,364 Warehouse Line of Credit #2 15,000 $ 6,274 $ 8,726 Total long-term debt $ 30,000 $ 14,910 $ 15,090 Mortgage Loan Funding Payable: Mortgage loan funding payable consists of liabilities to borrowers in connection with the origination of residential loans originated and intended for sale in the secondary market, that remain unfunded by the Company because there is typically a three day period from when the loans close to when they are funded by the warehouse line of credit. This liability is presented at cost and fully offsets the principal balance of the related loans included in mortgage loans held for sale, at fair value on the consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2022 and 2021 , there were no mortgage loan funding payable for both periods. Note 10. Income Taxes The provision (benefit) for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 consists of the following: For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (in thousands) Federal: Current $ — $ 6,107 $ 2,065 Deferred ( 6,064 ) 646 ( 839 ) ( 6,064 ) 6,753 1,226 State and local: Current 1,094 842 281 Deferred ( 7,467 ) 1,733 ( 353 ) ( 6,373 ) 2,575 ( 72 ) Valuation allowance 5,592 ( 1,119 ) 228 (Benefit) provision for income taxes $ ( 6,845 ) $ 8,209 $ 1,382 103 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Total income tax expense differed from the amounts computed by applying the U.S. federal income tax rate of 21 % for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 to income before income taxes as a result of the following: For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (in thousands) Income tax, at federal rate $ ( 7,738 ) $ 7,195 $ 1,099 State and local tax, net of federal benefit ( 5,035 ) 2,034 ( 57 ) Valuation allowance, net of federal benefit 5,592 ( 1,119 ) 228 Other 336 99 112 (Benefit) provision for income taxes $ ( 6,845 ) $ 8,209 $ 1,382 Management maintains a valuation allowance against its net New York State and New York City deferred tax as it is unlikely these deferred tax assets will be utilized to reduce the Company's tax liability in future years. For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2020 , the valuation allowance increased by $ 5.6 million and $ 0.2 million, respectively, and decreased by $ 1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. In 2021, Management recorded a valuation allowance against a portion of the charitable contribution carryforward that will expire in 2022 as it is unlikely this deferred tax asset will be utilized. As of December 31, 2022, the charitable contribution carryforward expired and the company reversed the deferred tax asset related to the carryforward. Accordingly, the valuation allowance that was established with regards to the utilization of these carryforwards was also reversed. Moreover, during 2022 the Company generated significant net operating losses in New York State and New York City which the Company does not believe it has the capacity to utilize and therefore has established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset related to these NOL carryforwards. Management has determined that it is not required to establish a valuation allowance against any other deferred tax assets since it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be fully utilized in future periods. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management considers the scheduled reversal of the deferred tax liabilities, the level of historical taxable income, and the projected future taxable income over the periods that the temporary differences comprising the deferred tax assets will be deductible. For federal income tax purposes, a financial institution may carry net operating losses (“NOLs”) to forward tax years indefinitely. The use of NOLs to offset income is limited to 80 %. The CARES Act allows NOLs generated in 2018, 2019 and 2020 to be carried back to each of the five preceding tax years. The Company did not generate NOLs in 2018, 2019 or 2020 so no carryback is available. At December 31, 2022 , the Bank has a federal NOL carryforward of $ 13.1 million. The state and city of New York allow for a three-year carryback period and carryforward period of twenty years on NOLs generated on or after tax year 2015. For tax years prior to 2015, no carryback period is allowed. Ponce De Leon Federal Bank, the predecessor of Ponce Bank, has pre-2015 carryforwards of $ 0.6 million for New York State purposes and $ 0.5 million for New York City purposes. Furthermore, there are post-2015 carryforwards available of $ 60.9 million for New York State purposes and $ 33.9 million for New York City purposes. For Connecticut purposes, losses may only be carried forward 20 years, with no allowable carryback period. At December 31, 2022, the Bank has a Connecticut NOL carryforward of $ 0.1 million. Finally for New Jersey purposes, losses may only be carried forward 20 years, with no allowable carryback period. At December 31, 2022 , the Bank has a New Jersey NOL carryforward of $ 0.5 million. At December 31, 2022 and 2021 , the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits recorded. The Company does not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase in the next twelve months. The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax, New York State income tax, Connecticut income tax, New Jersey income tax, Florida income tax, Pennsylvania income tax and New York City income tax. The Company is no longer subject to examination by taxing authorities for years before 2019. The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2022 and 2021 are presented below: 104 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements At December 31, 2022 2021 (in thousands) Deferred tax assets: Allowance for loan losses $ 11,324 $ 5,254 Deferred loan fees — 214 Interest on nonaccrual loans 317 102 Unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities 4,777 399 Amortization of intangible assets 32 50 Deferred rent payable — 152 Operating lease liabilities 11,304 — Net operating losses 9,119 3,280 Charitable contribution carryforward 1,859 366 Compensation and benefits 562 456 Other 478 264 Total gross deferred tax assets 39,772 10,537 Deferred tax liabilities: Depreciation of premises and equipment 1,049 1,301 Right of use assets 10,941 — Deferred loan fees 671 — Other 29 63 Total gross deferred tax liabilities 12,690 1,364 Valuation allowance 10,945 5,353 Net deferred tax assets $ 16,137 $ 3,820 The deferred tax expense (benefit) has been allocated between operations and equity as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2022 2021 2020 (in thousands) Equity $ ( 4,378 ) $ ( 424 ) $ 32 Operations ( 7,939 ) 1,260 ( 964 ) $ ( 12,317 ) $ 836 $ ( 932 ) 105 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 11. Compensation and Benefit Plans Ponce Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan with 401(k) Provisions (the “KSOP”) . Effective January 1, 2021, Ponce Bank amended and restated the terms of the Ponce Bank Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the “ESOP”) and merged the Ponce Bank 401(k) Plan into the ESOP to form the KSOP. There were no changes to the provisions of the ESOP as discussed below. The KSOP is for eligible employees of Ponce Bank and those of its affiliates. The named executive officers are eligible to participate in the KSOP just like other employees. An employee must attain the age of 21 and will be eligible to participate in the 401(k) features of the KSOP in the quarter following thirty days of service and the ESOP feature of the KSOP upon the first entry date commencing on or after the eligible employee’s completion of one year of service. Employees are eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan at the beginning of each quarter (January 1, April 1, July 1, or October 1). 401(k) Component : Under the 401(k) features of the KSOP (“401(k) Component”), a participant may elect to defer, on a pre-tax basis, the maximum amount as permitted by the Internal Revenue Code. For 2022, the salary deferral contribution limit was $ 20,500 ; provided, however, that a participant over age 50 may contribute an additional $ 6,500 to the 401(k) for a total of $ 27,000 . In addition to salary deferral contributions, Ponce Bank may make discretionary matching contributions, discretionary profit sharing contributions or safe harbor contributions to the 401(k) Component. Discretionary matching contributions are allocated on the basis of salary deferral contributions. Discretionary profit sharing contributions are based on three classifications set forth in the 401(k) feature (i) Class A — Chairman, President, and Executive Vice Presidents; (ii) Class B — Senior Vice Presidents, Vice Presidents and Assistant Vice Presidents; and (iii) Class C — all other eligible employees. The contribution for a class will be the same percentage of compensation for all participants in that class. If Ponce Bank decides to make a safe harbor contribution for a plan year, each participant will receive a contribution equal to 3 % of his or her compensation for the plan year. The 401(k) expenses recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations amounted to $ 0.4 million and $ 0.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. There were no 401(k) expenses recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2022, as this is now part of the KSOP. A participant is always 100 % vested in his or her salary deferral contributions and safe harbor contributions. Discretionary matching and profit sharing contributions are 20 % vested after two years of service, plus an additional 20 % for each additional year of service; so all participants are fully vested in such contributions after six years of service. Participants also will become fully vested in his or her account balance in the 401(k) Component automatically upon normal retirement, death or disability, a change in control, or termination of the KSOP. Generally, participants will receive distributions from the KSOP upon separation from service in accordance with the terms of the governing document. ESOP Component: On September 29, 2017, in connection with the Bank’s reorganization into the mutual holding company form of organization, the ESOP trustee purchased, on behalf of the ESOP, 723,751 shares of PDL Community Bancorp common stock. The ESOP funded its stock purchase with a loan (“First ESOP loan”) from PDL Community Bancorp in the amount of $ 7.2 million, which was equal to the aggregate purchase price of the common stock. The First ESOP loan is being repaid principally through Ponce Bank’s contributions to the ESOP over the 15 -year term of such loan. The interest rate for the First ESOP loan is 2.60 %. On January 27, 2022, concurrent with the completion of the conversion and reorganization of Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company from a mutual form to a stock form of organization and the merger of PDL Community Bancorp with and into Ponce Financial Group, Inc., the shares of PDL Community Bancorp common stock held by the KSOP were converted into 977,880 shares of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock. On January 27, 2022, the KSOP trustee purchased, on behalf of the ESOP feature of the KSOP (“ESOP Component”), an additional 1,097,353 shares of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock, or 4.44 % of the total number of shares of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock outstanding on January 27, 2022 (including shares issued to the Foundation). The KSOP funded this stock purchase with a loan (“Second ESOP loan”) from Ponce Financial Group, Inc. in the amount of $ 11.0 million, which was equal to the aggregate purchase price of the common stock. The Second ESOP loan is being repaid principally through Ponce Bank’s contributions to the ESOP Component over the 15 -year term of such loan. The interest rate for the Second ESOP loan is 1.82 %. The trustee of the trust funding the KSOP holds the shares of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock purchased by the KSOP in an unallocated suspense account, and shares will be released from the suspense account on a pro-rata basis as the loans are repaid. The trustee will allocate the shares released among participants on the basis of each participant’s proportional share of qualifying compensation relative to all participants participating in the ESOP Component. A participant will become 100 % vested in his or her 106 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements account balance in the ESOP Component after three years of service. In addition, participants will become fully vested in his or her account balance in the ESOP Component automatically upon normal retirement, death or disability, a change in control, or termination of the KSOP. Generally, participants will receive distributions from the KSOP upon separation from service in accordance with the terms of the plan document. The KSOP reallocates any unvested shares of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock forfeited upon termination of employment among the remaining participants in the ESOP Component. Contributions to the ESOP are to be sufficient to pay principal and interest currently due under the loan agreement. Under applicable accounting requirements, Ponce Bank will record a compensation expense for the ESOP at the average market price of the shares as they are committed to be released from the unallocated suspense account to participants’ accounts, which may be more or less than the original issue price. The compensation expense resulting from the release of the common stock from the suspense account and allocation to plan participants will result in a corresponding reduction in the earnings of Ponce Financial Group, Inc. The ESOP shares become outstanding for earnings per share computations (see Note 12). As of December 31, 2022 , the combined outstanding balance of both the First ESOP loan and Second ESOP loan was $ 14.2 million. A summary of the ESOP shares as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows: December 31, 2022 December 31, 2021 (Dollars in thousands) Shares committed-to-be released 133,744 96,500 Shares allocated to participants 354,227 170,145 Unallocated shares 1,569,475 434,251 Total 2,057,446 700,896 Fair value of unallocated shares $ 14,628 $ 6,297 The Company recognized ESOP related compensation expense, including ESOP equalization expense, of $ 1.4 million, $ 1.4 million and $ 0.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan: The Bank maintains a non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plan (“SERP”) for the benefit of two key executive officers. The SERP expenses recognized for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2020 were $ 0.1 million each for the one key executive officer. The SERP expenses recognized for the year ended December 31, 2021 were $ 0.3 million for the two key executive officers. 2018 Incentive Plan The Company’s stockholders approved the PDL Community Bancorp 2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2018 Incentive Plan”) at the Special Meeting of Stockholders on October 30, 2018. The maximum number of shares of common stock which can be issued under the 2018 Incentive Plan is 1,248,469 . Of the 1,248,469 shares, the maximum number of shares that may be awarded under the 2018 Incentive Plan pursuant to the exercise of stock options or stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) is 891,764 shares (all of which may be granted as incentive stock options), and the number of shares of common stock that may be issued as restricted stock awards or restricted stock units is 356,705 shares. However, the 2018 Incentive Plan contains a flex feature that provides that awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units in excess of the 356,705 share limitation may be granted but each share of stock covered by such excess award shall reduce the 891,764 share limitation for awards of stock options and SARs by 3.0 shares of common stock. The Company converted 462,522 awards of stock options into 154,174 restricted stock units in 2018, 45,000 awards of stock options into 15,000 restricted stock units in 2020 and 191,145 awards of stock options into 63,715 restricted stock units in 2022. Under the 2018 Incentive Plan, the Company made grants equal to 674,645 shares on December 4, 2018 which include 119,176 incentive options to executive officers, 44,590 non-qualified options to outside directors, 322,254 restricted stock units to executive officers, 40,000 restricted stock units to non-executive officers and 148,625 restricted stock units to outside directors. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company awarded 40,000 incentive options and 15,000 restricted stock units to non-executive officers under the 2018 Incentive Plan. Awards to directors generally vest 20 % annually beginning with the first anniversary of the date of grant. Awards to a director with fewer than five years of service at the time of grant vest over a longer period and will not become fully vested until the director has completed ten years of service. Awards to the executive officer who is not a director vest 20 % annually beginning on December 4, 2020. On April 1, 2022, the Company awarded 23,718 incentive options to an executive officer, 30,659 incentive options to non-executive officers and 13,952 non-qualified options to an outside director. In addition, on April 1, 2022 the Company awarded 40,460 restricted stock units to executive officers and 23,255 restricted stock units to outside directors. As of December 31, 107 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 2021, the maximum number of stock options and SARs remaining to be awarded under the Incentive Plan was 189,476 . As of December 31, 2022, the maximum number of stock options and SARs remaining to be awarded under the Incentive Plan was 4,883 , after the conversion from PDL Community Bancorp common stock to Ponce Financial Group, Inc. common stock. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021 , the maximum number of shares of common stock that may be issued as restricted stock or restricted stock units remaining to be awarded under the Incentive Plan was none , for both periods. The product of the number of units granted and the grant date market price of the Company’s common stock determine the fair value of restricted stock units under the Company’s 2018 Incentive Plan. Management recognizes compensation expense for the fair value of restricted stock units on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. A summary of the Company’s restricted stock units activity and related information for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows: December 31, 2022 Number of Shares Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share Non-vested, beginning of year 237,687 $ 12.65 Conversion and reorganization 93,933 — Granted 63,715 10.44 Vested ( 149,495 ) 9.11 Forfeited — — Non-vested at December 31 245,840 $ 9.40 December 31, 2021 Number of Shares Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share Non-vested, beginning of year (1) 335,919 $ 12.66 Granted — — Vested ( 98,232 ) 12.69 Forfeited — — Non-vested at December 31 237,687 $ 12.65 Compensation expense related to restricted stock units for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $ 1.4 million, $ 1.3 million and $ 1.3 million, respectively.

Commitments, Contingencies and Credit Risk Financial Instruments With Off-Balance-Sheet Risk : In the normal course of business, financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk may be used to meet the financing needs of customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition. The contractual amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of involvement in particular classes of financial instruments. The contractual amounts of commitments to extend credit represent the amounts of potential accounting loss should the contract be fully drawn upon, the customer default, and the value of any existing collateral become worthless. The same credit policies are used in making commitments and contractual obligations as for on-balance-sheet instruments. Financial instruments whose contractual amounts represent credit risk at December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows: December 31, December 31, 2022 2021 (in thousands) Commitments to grant mortgage loans $ 207,105 $ 127,159 Commitments to sell loans at lock-in rates 1,676 13,321 Unfunded commitments under lines of credit 72,530 80,033 $ 281,311 $ 220,513 110 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Commitments to Grant Mortgage Loans : Commitments to grant mortgage loans are agreements to lend to a customer as long as all terms and conditions are met as established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses, and may require payment of a fee by the borrower. Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Each customer's creditworthiness is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary upon extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, residential real estate and income-producing commercial properties. Material losses are not anticipated as a result of these transactions. Commitments to Sell Loans at Lock-in Rates: In order to assure itself of a marketplace to sell its loans, Mortgage World has agreements with investors who will commit to purchase loans at locked-in rates. Mortgage World has off-balance sheet market risk to the extent that Mortgage World does not obtain matching commitments from these investors to purchase the loans. This will expose Mortgage World to the lower of cost or market valuation environment. Repurchases, Indemnifications and Premium Recaptures : Loans sold by Mortgage World under investor programs are subject to repurchase or indemnification if they fail to meet the origination criteria of those programs. In addition, loans sold to investors are also subject to repurchase or indemnifications if the loan is two or three months delinquent during a set period which usually varies from six months to a year after the loan is sold. There are no open repurchase or indemnification requests for loans sold as a correspondent lender or where the Company acted as a broker in the transaction as of December 31, 2022. Unfunded Commitments Under Lines of Credit : Unfunded commitments under commercial lines of credit, revolving credit lines and overdraft protection agreements are commitments for possible future extension of credit to existing customers. These lines of credit are uncollateralized and usually contain a specified maturity date and, ultimately, may not be drawn upon to the total extent to which the Company is committed. Unfunded Commitments with Bamboo : On October 1, 2022, the Bank entered into a Membership Interest Purchase Agreement with Bamboo. Under the agreement, the Bank purchased from Bamboo 180 Membership Interest Units representing an aggregate amount equal to up to 18 % of total issued and outstanding Membership Interest in Bamboo for a purchase price of $ 2.5 million. The Bank is committed to make an additional contribution of $ 0.5 million. The additional contribution will be made during the first quarter of 2023. Unfunded Commitments with Oaktree : In December of 2021, the Bank committed to invest $ 5.0 million in Oaktree SBIC Fund, L.P. (""Oaktree""). As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the total unfunded commitment was $ 2.8 million and $ 3.9 million. Unfunded Commitments with Silvergate : In April of 2022, the Bank committed to invest $ 5.0 million in EJF Silvergate Ventures Fund LP (""Silvergate""). As of December 31, 2022, the total unfunded commitment was $ 3.3 million. Letters of Credit : Letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. These guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. Letters of credit are largely cash secured. Concentration by Geographic Location : Loans, commitments to extend credit and letters of credit have been granted to customers who are located primarily in the New York City metropolitan area. Generally, such loans most often are secured by one-to-four family residential properties. The loans are expected to be repaid from the borrowers' cash flows. Legal Matters : The Company is involved in various legal proceedings which have arisen in the normal course of business. Management believes that resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. Note 14. Fair Value The following fair value hierarchy is used based on the lowest level of input significant to the fair value measurement. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair values: Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date. Level 2 – Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. 111 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Level 3 – Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a company’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The Company used the following methods and significant assumptions to estimate fair value: Cash and Cash Equivalents, Placements with Banks, Accrued Interest Receivable, Advance Payments by Borrowers for Taxes and Insurance, and Accrued Interest Payable : The carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. These assets and liabilities were not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Available-for-Sale Securities : These financial instruments are recorded at fair value in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted prices are not available, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models (e.g., matrix pricing) or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics and are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Examples of such instruments include government agency bonds and mortgage-backed securities. Level 3 securities are securities for which significant unobservable inputs are utilized. There were no changes in valuation techniques used to measure similar assets during the period. FHLBNY Stock : The carrying value of FHLBNY stock approximates fair value since the Bank can redeem such stock with FHLBNY at cost. As a member of the FHLBNY, the Company is required to purchase this stock, which we carry at cost and classified as restricted equity securities. Loans Receivable : For variable rate loans, which reprice frequently and have no significant change in credit risk, carrying values are a reasonable estimate of fair values, adjusted for credit losses inherent in the portfolios. The fair value of fixed rate loans is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using estimated market rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities, adjusted for credit losses inherent in the portfolios. Impaired loans are valued using a present value discounted cash flow method, or the fair value of the collateral. Loans are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Mortgage Loans Held for Sale : Mortgage loans held for sale, at fair value, consists primarily of mortgage loans originated for sale by Mortgage World and accounted for under the fair value option. These assets are valued using stated investor pricing for substantially equivalent loans as Level 2. In determining fair value, such measurements are derived based on observable market data, investor commitments, or broker quotations, including whole-loan transaction pricing and similar market transactions adjusted for portfolio composition, servicing value and market conditions. Loans held for sale by the Bank are carried at the lower of cost or fair value as determined by investor bid prices. Under the fair value option, management has elected, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, fair value accounting for substantially all forms of mortgage loans originated for sale on a recurring basis. The fair value carrying amount of mortgages held for sale under the fair value option was $ 2.0 million and the aggregate unpaid principal balance amounted to $ 2.0 million. Interest Rate Lock Commitments : Mortgage World enters into rate lock commitments to extend credit to borrowers for generally up to a 60 day period for origination and/or purchase of loans. To the extent that a loan is ultimately granted and the borrower ultimately accepts the terms of the loan, these loan commitments expose the Bank's Mortgage World division to variability in its fair value due to changes in interest rates. The FASB determined that loan commitments related to the origination or acquisition of mortgage loans that will be held for sale must be accounted for as derivative instruments. Such commitments, along with any related fees received from potential borrowers, are recorded at fair value in derivative assets or liabilities, with changes in fair value recorded in net gain or loss on sale of mortgage loans. Fair value is based on active market pricing for substantially similar underlying mortgage loans commonly referred to as best execution pricing or investment commitment pricing, if the loan is committed to an investor through a best efforts contract. In valuing interest rate lock commitments, there are several unobservable inputs such as the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights, estimated remaining cost to originate the loans, and the pull through rate of the open pipeline. Accordingly, such derivative is classified as Level 3. The approximate notional amounts of Mortgage World’s derivative instruments was $ 1.7 million and $ 13.3 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021 , respectively. The fair value of derivatives related to interest rate lock commitments not subject to a forward loan sale commitment, amounted to $ 0.02 million and $ 0.2 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, and is included in other assets on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Conditions. 112 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements The table below presents the changes in derivatives from interest rate lock commitments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis: (in thousands) Balance as of December 31, 2021 $ 172 Change in fair value of derivative instrument reported in earnings ( 150 ) Balance as of December 31, 2022 $ 22 Other Real Estate Owned : Other real estate owned represents real estate acquired through foreclosure, and is recorded at fair value less estimated disposal costs on a nonrecurring basis. Fair value is based upon independent market prices, appraised values of the collateral or management's estimation of the value of the collateral. When the fair value of the collateral is based on an observable market price or a current appraised value, the asset is classified as Level 2. When an appraised value is not available or management determines the fair value of the collateral is further impaired below the appraised value and there is no observable market price, the asset is classified as Level 3. Deposits : The fair values of demand deposits, savings, NOW, reciprocal deposits and money market accounts equal their carrying amounts, which represent the amounts payable on demand at the reporting date. Fair values for fixed-term, fixed-rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies market interest rates on certificates of deposit to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on such deposits. Deposits are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. FHLBNY Advances : The fair value of the advances is estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies current market-based FHLBNY interest rates for advances of similar maturity to a schedule of maturities of such advances. These borrowings are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Warehouse Lines of Credit : The carrying amounts of warehouse lines of credit approximate fair value and due to their short-term nature are classified as Level 2. One of the warehouse lines of credit was terminated on March 31, 2022 and one was terminated on February 7, 2023 . Off-Balance-Sheet Instruments : Fair values for off-balance-sheet instruments (lending commitments and letters of credit) are based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties' credit standing. Off-balance-sheet instruments are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. The following tables detail the assets that are carried at fair value and measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, and indicate the level within the fair value hierarchy utilized to determine the fair value: December 31, 2022 Description Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 (in thousands) Available-for-Sale Securities, at fair value: U.S. Government Bonds $ 2,689 $ 2,689 $ — $ — Corporate bonds 23,359 730 22,629 — Mortgage-Backed Securities: Collateralized Mortgage Obligations 37,777 — 37,777 — FHLMC Certificates 9,634 9,634 FNMA Certificates 55,928 — 55,928 — GNMA Certificates 118 — 118 — Mortgage Loans Held for Sale, at fair value 1,979 — 1,979 — Derivatives from interest rate lock commitments 22 — — 22 $ 131,506 $ 3,419 $ 128,065 $ 22 113 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements December 31, 2021 Description Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 (in thousands) Available-for-Sale Securities: U.S. Government Bonds $ 2,934 $ — $ 2,934 $ — Corporate bonds 21,184 — 16,255 4,929 Mortgage-Backed Securities: Collateralized Mortgage Obligations 18,348 — 18,348 — FNMA Certificates 70,699 — 70,699 — GNMA Certificates 181 — 181 — Mortgage Loans Held for Sale, at fair value 15,836 — 15,836 — Derivatives from interest rate lock commitments 172 — — 172 $ 129,354 $ — $ 124,253 $ 5,101 Management’s assessment and classification of an investment within a level can change over time based upon maturity or liquidity of the investment and would be reflected at the beginning of the quarter in which the change occurred. The following tables detail the assets carried at fair value and measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 and indicate the fair value hierarchy utilized to determine the fair value: December 31, 2022 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 (in thousands) Impaired loans $ 17,952 $ — $ — $ 17,952 December 31, 2021 Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 (in thousands) Impaired loans $ 17,651 $ — $ — $ 17,651 Losses on assets carried at fair value on a nonrecurring basis were de minimis for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

There was one transfer out of Level 3 assets in the fair value hierarchy at December 31, 2022 due to more observability of the inputs and the comparability to other assets trading in the marketplace on valuation date. There were no transfers into or out of Level 3 for the year ended December 31, 2021. Fair value for Level 3 securities was determined using a third-party pricing service with limited levels of activity and price transparency. Off-Balance-Sheet Instruments : There loan commitments on which the committed interest rate is less than the current market rate insignificant at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The fair value information about financial instruments are disclosed, whether or not recognized in the consolidated statements of financial condition, for which it is practicable to estimate that value. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value of the Company. The estimated fair value amounts for 2022 and 2021 have been measured as of their respective period-ends and have not been reevaluated or updated for purposes of these consolidated financial statements subsequent to those respective dates. As such, the estimated fair values of these financial instruments subsequent to the respective reporting dates may be different than amounts reported at each period. The information presented should not be interpreted as an estimate of the fair value of the entire Company since a fair value calculation is only required for a limited portion of the Company's assets and liabilities. Due to the wide range of valuation techniques and the degree of subjectivity used in making the estimates, comparisons between the Company's disclosures and those of other banks may not be meaningful. Note 15. Regulatory Capital Requirements The Company and the Bank are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal Reserve Board, the OCC and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s operations and financial statements. Under the regulatory capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company's assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Quantitative measures established by regulation require the maintenance of minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of total risk-based and Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets (as defined), common equity Tier 1 capital (as defined), and Tier 1 capital to adjusted total assets (as defined) adjusted total assets (as defined). As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the applicable capital adequacy requirements specified below have been met. The below minimum capital requirements exclude the capital conservation buffer required to avoid limitations on capital distributions including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The applicable capital buffer for the Bank was 22.53 % and 9.23 % at December 31, 2022 and 2021. The most recent notification from the OCC categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized, the Company and the Bank must maintain minimum total risk-based, common equity risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the table below. There were no conditions or events since then that have changed the Bank's category. 116 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements The Company's and the Bank’s actual capital amounts and ratios as of December 31, 2022 and 2022 as compared to regulatory requirements are as follows: To Be Well Capitalized Under For Capital Prompt Corrective Actual Adequacy Purposes Action Provisions Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio (Dollars in thousands) December 31, 2022 Ponce Financial Group, Inc.

Changes in and Disagreements with Acco untants on Accounting and Financial Disclosure. None. Item 9A. Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the President and Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of December 31, 2022. Based on that evaluation, the Company’s management, including the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer regarding the reliability of financial reporting and preparation of the Company’s financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In designing and evaluating the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures, the Company and its management recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only a reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management was required to apply its judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based on management’s assessment, the Company believes that, as of December 31, 2022, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on the criteria established by Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. Not applicable. There were no significant changes made in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

The Company’s common stock is traded on The NASDAQ Stock Market, LLC under the symbol “PDLB.” Ponce Bank Ponce Bank is a federally-chartered stock savings association headquartered in the Bronx, New York. Ponce Bank was originally chartered in 1960 as a federally-chartered mutual savings and loan association under the name Ponce De Leon Federal Savings and Loan Association. In 1985, the Bank changed its name to “Ponce De Leon Federal Savings Bank.” In 1997, the Bank changed its name again to “Ponce De Leon Federal Bank.” In 2017, the Bank adopted its current name. The Bank is designated as a Minority Depository Institution (“MDI”) and a Community Development Financial Institution (“CDFI”) under applicable regulations and is a certified Small Business Administration (“SBA’) lender. The Company’s business is conducted through the administrative office and 13 full service banking offices and 5 mortgage loan offices. The banking offices are located in New York City – the Bronx (4 branches), Manhattan (2 branches), Queens (3 branches), Brooklyn (3 branches) and Union City (1 branch), New Jersey. The mortgage loan offices are located in Queens (2) and Brooklyn (1), New York and Englewood Cliffs (1) and Bergenfield (1), New Jersey. The Company’s primary market area currently consists of the New York City metropolitan area. The Bank’s business primarily consists of taking deposits from the general public and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings, in mortgage loans, consisting of one-to-four family residential (both investor-owned and owner-occupied), multifamily residential, nonresidential properties, construction and land, and in business and consumer loans. The Bank also invests in securities, which have historically consisted of U.S. government and federal agency securities and securities issued by government-sponsored or owned enterprises, as well as, mortgage-backed securities, corporate bonds and Federal Home Loan Bank 1 of New York (the “FHLBNY”) stock . The Bank offers a variety of deposit accounts, including demand, savings, money markets , NOW/IOLA accounts, reciprocal deposits and certificates of deposit accounts. Mortgage World Bankers, Inc. On January 26, 2022, the assets and liabilities of Mortgage World Bankers, Inc. (“Mortgage World”), a wholly owned subsidiary of PDL Community Bancorp, were transferred to the Bank. Except for the winding up of its operations, Mortgage World ceased to conduct business as a separate entity at that time. Mortgage World was a mortgage banking entity subject to the comprehensive regulation and examination of the New York State Department of Financial Services. The primary business of Mortgage World was the taking of applications from the general public for residential mortgage loans, underwriting them to investors’ standards, closing and funding them and holding them until they were sold to investors. The Company intends that the Bank will continue this mortgage banking business as a division of the Bank. Business Strategy The Company’s goal is to provide long-term value to our stockholders, customers, employees and the communities we serve (collectively our “stakeholders”) by executing a safe and sound business strategy that produces increasing value. The Company believes there is a significant opportunity for an immigrant community-focused, minority directed bank to provide a full range of financial services to commercial and retail customers in our market area and other similar communities. Our current business strategy consists of the following: • Continue to expand our multifamily and nonresidential loans. The additional capital raised as part of our recent conversion and reorganization increased our capacity to originate multifamily and nonresidential loans. Under our current board approved loan concentration policy, such loans, including construction and land loans, shall not exceed 400% of our total risk-based capital. Most multifamily and nonresidential loans are originated with adjustable rates and, as a result, these loans are expected to change loan yields due to their shorter repricing terms compared to longer-term fixed-rate loans. • Community lending programs. The Bank is an authorized direct lender under the SBA and a CDFI. Both of these programs, combined with our pre-existing products, bolster the Bank’s commitment to continue to serve the communities that it has supported over the past sixty years. • Continue to increase core deposits, with an emphasis on low cost commercial demand deposits, and add non-core funding sources . Deposits are the major source of balance sheet funding for lending and other investments. Certificates of deposit, brokered deposits, and listing service deposits supplement the Bank’s funding base. We have made significant investments in new products and services, marketing programs, personnel, our branch distribution system as well as enhancing our electronic delivery solutions in an effort to become more competitive in the financial services marketplace and attract more core deposits. Core deposits are our least costly source of funds and represent our best opportunity to develop customer relationships that enable us to cross-sell our enhanced products and services. • Manage credit risk to maintain a low level of nonperforming assets . We believe strong asset quality is a key to our long-term financial success. Our strategy for credit risk management focuses on having an experienced team of credit professionals, well-defined policies and procedures, appropriate loan underwriting criteria and active credit monitoring. The majority of our non-performing assets have been related to one-to-four family residential loans and, to a lesser extent, multifamily residential loans, and construction and land loans. We continue to focus on enhancing our credit review function, adding both personnel and ancillary systems, in order to be able to evaluate more complex loans and better manage credit risk, to further support our intended loan growth. • Expand our employee base to support future growth . We have already made significant investments in our employee base. However, we will continue to work to attract and retain the necessary talent to support increased lending, deposit activities and enhanced information technology. 2 • Improving our digital presence and streamline the customer experience. By investing in and improving on the interfaces that connect customers to our products and services, we believe we will be in a better position to compete and grow in an environment that is becoming increasingly technology driven. We have and intend to continue to invest in our online presence and engage in digital strategies that will help us to successfully compete in an ever-changing digital marketplace. In 2020, the Company rolled out its first Fintech-based product in partnership with the startup company Grain Technologies, Inc. (“Grain”). Grain’s product is a mobile application geared to the underbanked and new generations entering the financial services market that uses non-traditional underwriting methodologies. We have deployed a Fintech-based small business automated lending technology in partnership with LendingFront Technologies, Inc (“LendingFront”). The technology is a mobile application that digitizes the lending workflow from pre-approval to servicing and enables us to originate, close and fund small business loans within very short spans of time, without requiring a physical presence within banking offices and with automated underwriting using both traditional and non-traditional methods. The Company also established a relationship with SaveBetter, LLC (“SaveBetter”), a fintech startup focusing on brokered deposits. • Grow organically and through opportunistic bank or other acquisitions . We focus primarily on organic growth as a lower-risk means of deploying our capital. We will fund improvements in our operating facilities and customer delivery services in order to enhance our competitiveness. Opportunistic acquisition and/or partnership opportunities are explored if we believe they would enhance the value of our franchise and yield potential financial benefits for our stakeholders. Although we believe opportunities exist to increase our market share in our current market areas, we will also consider expanding into other markets, enlarging our current branch network, or adding loan production offices, provided we believe such efforts would enhance our competitive standing. For additional information related to our business strategies, see “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Vision 2025 Evolves."" Employees and Human Capital Resources As of December 31, 2021, the Company had 217 full time equivalent employees. None of the Company’s employees are represented by a labor union, and management considers its relationship with employees to be good. The Company believes its ability to attract and retain employees is key to its success. Accordingly, the Company strives to offer competitive salaries and employee benefits to all employees and monitors salaries and other compensation in its market area. The Company encourages and supports the growth and development of our employees. Continual learning and career development is advanced through ongoing performance and development conversations with employees, internally developed training programs and educational reimbursement programs. The Company is responsible for creating an equitable workplace ensuring diversity at all management levels. The Company prides itself on establishing a diverse workforce that serves our diverse customer base in the New York metro area. The Company’s inclusion and diversity program focuses on its workforce, workplace, and community. The Company believes that its business is strengthened by a diverse workforce that reflects the commuities in which it operates. The Company believes that all of its team members should be treated with respect and equality, regardless of gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, religious beliefs, or other characteristics. The Company has also broadened its focus on inclusion and diversity by including social and racial equity in its conversations and equipping and empowering its team leaders with appropriate tools and training. While it appears the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to enter into an endemic stage, related measures taken by governments, businesses and individuals as a result of the pandemic continue to cause uncertainty, volatility and disruption in the economy, including the economies of the markets that we serve. Throughout 2020 and continuing into 2021 in response to the pandemic, we adjusted our business practices, including restricting employee travel, encouraging employees to work from home when possible, implementing social distancing guidelines within our offices, and continuing to hold regular meetings of our pandemic response team. Certain of these measures remain in place due to the continued prevalence of the virus, though, as of December 31, 2021, all of our customer locations are open and the majority of our employees have returned to the office. Market Area 3 The Bank is headquartered in the Bronx, New York, with a primary market in the other boroughs of New York City (excluding Staten Island) and Hudson County, New Jersey . The size and complex nature of the geographic footprint makes for diverse demographics that continue to undergo significant changes, in terms of economic, racial, ethnic and age parameters, all with potentially substantial long-term institutional ramifications. The Bank’s primary deposit base includes a large and stable base of locally employed blue-collar workers with low-to-medium income, middle-aged, and with limited investment funds. Within the base of locally employed blue-collar workers there is a significant, and growing, portion of recently immigrated, younger, lower-skilled laborers. The influx of immigrant lower-skilled workers, however, has been hampered by the increases in rental rates in the rental housing market within the New York City metropolitan area. Another significant customer segment of the Bank consists of middle aged and older white-collar, high-income individuals, many of whom are self-employed real estate investors and developers. They constitute a large percentage of the borrowing base of the Bank and, increasingly, are becoming the source of a significant percentage of commercial deposits. The Bank has historically been funded through local community deposits. The Bank continues to rely primarily on community deposits from its market areas to fund investments and loans. However, the mix of community deposits now includes demand and money market funds of consumer, commercial and not-for-profit entities, with a decreasing reliance on time deposits. Additionally, the Bank has been using alternative funding sources such as brokered deposits and FHLBNY advances to support loan growth. The Bank’s market was significantly impacted negatively by the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic caused substantial economic slowdowns, leading to unemployment, closures of businesses and other hardships. The federal government response, including lowering of interest rates, SBA Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) lending, extended unemployment benefits and business assistance, provided notable economic support, leading to significant economic recovery. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bank continued to service the market area. Competition The Company faces significant competition within its market area both in originating loans and attracting deposits. There is a high concentration of financial institutions in the market area, including national, regional and other locally-operated commercial banks, savings banks, savings associations and credit unions whose activities include banking as well as mortgage lending. Several “mega” banks exist in the market, such as JPMorgan Chase, Citibank and Capital One, many of whom are continuing to push for retail deposits and home mortgages. A number of the Bank’s competitors offer non-deposit products and services that the Bank does not currently offer, such as trust services, private banking, insurance services and asset management. Additionally, the Company faces an increasing level of competition from non-core financial service providers that do not necessarily maintain a physical presence in the Bank’s market area, such as Radius Bank, Quicken Loans, Freedom Mortgage and many internet financial service providers. The amount of competition facing the Company is extensive and can negatively impact its growth. The market share of bank deposits in the New York area can be difficult to quantify, as some “mega” banks will include large scale deposits from around the world as held at headquarters. However, in Bronx County, New York, where the Bank maintains four branches, it holds 1.81% (as of June 30, 2021) of the market’s deposits. This represents the Bank’s largest market share in a county-level area. The Bank continues to work to improve its market position by expanding its brand within its current market area, and building its capacity to provide more products and services to its customers. Lending Activities 4 General . The Bank’s principal lending activity is originating real estate -secured loans , including one-to-four family investor-owned and owner-occupied residential , multifamily residential, nonresidential property, construction and land loans , and commercial and industrial (“C&I”) business loans and consumer loans. It originates real estate and other loans through its loan officers, marketing efforts, customer base, walk-in customers and referrals from real estate brokers, builders and attorneys. T he Bank has entered into a partnership with Grain . Through Grain , the Bank provides a consumer lin e of credit using a mobile application geared nationally to the underbanked and new generations entering the financial services market that uses non-traditional underwriting methodologies . These loans are reflected in the consumer loan portfolio. During 2021 and 2020, the Bank focused on making PPP loans within its market area, to both customers and non-customers. Subject to market conditions and its asset-liability analysis, the Bank look s to maintain its emphasis on multifamily residential and nonresidential property loans while grow ing the overall loan portfolio and increas ing the overall yield earned on loans. Lending activities are conducted primarily by the Bank’s salaried loan officers operating at its main and branch office locations as well as remotely. It also conducts lending activities through its subsidiary Ponce De Leon Mortgage Corporation. All loan originations are underwritten pursuant to the Bank’s policies and procedures. The Bank currently intends that substantially all of its mortgage loan originations will have adjustable interest rates. For its non-PPP business loan originations, variable rate pricing is offered based on prime rate plus a margin. Mortgage World’s lending activities consisted of taking applications from the general public for residential mortgage loans, underwriting them to investors’ standards, closing and funding them and holding them until they were sold to investors. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, 27 loans and 70 loans related to Mortgage World in the amount of $15.8 million and $34.4 million, respectively, were held for sale and accounted for under the fair value option accounting guidance for financial assets and financial liabilities. Because of Mortgage World’s business and that all of its loans were held for sale, they are not included in the discussion that follows. See Note 13, “Fair Value” of the Notes to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Loan Portfolio Composition. The following table sets forth the composition of the Bank’s loan portfolio by type of loan (excluding mortgage loans held for sale) at the dates indicated. Loans in process at December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $118.9 million and $101.1 million, respectively.

At December 31, 2020, there was one mortgage loan held for sale, at fair value, in the amount of $1.0 million related to the Bank. 5 Loan Products Offered by the Bank. The following table provides a breakdown of the Bank’s loan portfolio by product type and principal balance outstanding at December 31, 2021, excluding mortgage loans held for sale. At December 31, 2021 Loan Type # of Loans Principal Balance % of Portfolio (Dollars in thousands) Mortgage loans: 1-4 Family residential Investor-owned 524 $ 317,304 24.01 % Owner-occupied 233 96,947 7.33 % Multifamily residential 315 348,300 26.34 % Nonresidential properties 199 239,691 18.13 % Construction and land Construction 1-4 Investor 2 2,046 0.15 % Construction Multifamily 27 116,645 8.82 % Construction Nonresidential 4 15,045 1.14 % Land loan 1 915 0.07 % Nonmortgage loans: Business loans C&I lines of credit 50 4,497 0.34 % C&I loans (term) 14 9,244 0.70 % PPP loans 1606 136,771 10.34 % Consumer loans Unsecured (1) 59,203 34,220 2.59 % Passbook 67 473 0.04 % Grand Total 62,245 $ 1,322,098 100.00 % (1) Includes 59,180 loans totaling $33.9 million which were outstanding and serviced by the Bank pursuant to its arrangement with Grain. One-to-four Family Investor-Owned Loans. At December 31, 2021, one-to-four family investor-owned loans were $317.3 million, or 24.0% of the Bank’s total loans. Investor-owned mortgage loans secured by non-owner-occupied one-to-four family residential property represent’s the Bank’s second largest lending concentration. The majority of the portfolio, $280.9 million, or 88.5%, are two-to-four family properties (445 accounts), while the remaining $79.0 million, or 11.5%, are primarily single family, non-owner-occupied investment properties (79 accounts). Of the three largest loans in this category, two loans had outstanding balances of $3.0 million each and one loan had an outstanding balance of $2.8 million. In this category, loans totaling $124.5 million, or 39.3%, are secured by properties located in Queens County, $108.8 million, or 34.3%, in Kings County, $33.3 million, or 10.5%, in Bronx County, $12.1 million, or 3.8%, in Westchester County, $12.0 million, or 3.8%, in New York County and $6.3 million, or 2.0%, in Nassau County. The rest of this category, less than 6.3%, is spread out in other counties and no other concentration exceeded $5.5 million, or 0.4%. The Bank imposes prudent underwriting guidelines in the origination of such loans, including lower maximum loan-to-value ratios (“LTVs”) of 70% on purchases and 70% on refinances, a required minimum debt service coverage ratio (“DSCR,” net operating income divided by debt service requirement) of 1.20x that must be met by either the property on a standalone basis or by the inclusion of the owner(s) as co-borrower(s). In addition, all origination of such loans currently require that the transaction exhibit a global debt service coverage ratio (net operating income divided by debt service requirement) of no less than 1.0x. This coverage ratio indicates that the owner has the capacity to support the loan along with all personal obligations. On occasion, the Bank has required that the borrower establish a cash reserve to be held at the Bank in order to provide additional security. The maximum term on such loans is 30 years, typically with five-year adjustable rates. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bank adopted temporary guidelines lowering LTVs by 5 percentiles and increasing DSCRs by 10 percentiles. One-to-four family investor-owned real estate loans involve a greater degree of risk than one-to-four family owner-occupied real estate loans. Rather than depending on the borrower’s repayment ability from employment or other income, the borrower’s repayment ability is primarily dependent on ensuring that a tenant occupies the investor property and has the financial capacity to pay sufficient rent to cover the borrower’s debt. In addition, if an investor borrower has several loans secured by properties in the same market, the loans have risks similar to a multifamily real estate loan and repayment of those loans is subject to adverse conditions in the rental market or the local economy. 6 One-to-four Family Owner-occupied Loans. O ne-to-four family owner-occupied loans totaled $9 6 . 9 million, or 7 . 3 % of the Bank’s total loan portfolio at December 31, 2021 . T he three largest loans outstanding in this category had outstanding balance s of $ 2. 0 million , $ 1.9 million and $1.7 million . There are 2 1 loans with an outstanding balance in excess of $1.0 million , totaling $27. 2 million, or approximately 2 8 . 0 % of this category . At December 31, 2021 , approximately $ 3 4 .1 million, or 3 5 . 1 %, of this category wa s secured by properties located in Queens County , $ 19 . 1 million, or 1 9 . 7 %, in Kings County , $9. 2 million, or 9. 5 %, in Nassau County , $ 7.1 m illion, or 7.3% , in Bronx County, $ 6 . 4 million, or 6 . 6 % , in New York County and $6.4 million, or 6.6%, in Westchester County . The rest of this category, less than 15 . 2 %, is spread out in other counties and no other concentration exceeded $5. 8 million, or 0.4 % . It is the Bank’s policy to underwrite loans secured by one-to-four family owner-occupied residential real estate in a manner that ensures strict compliance with Dodd-Frank regulatory requirements. This includes underwriting only mortgages that have a debt-to-income ratio of 43% or less or that meet non-qualified mortgage standards. A Qualified Mortgage is presumed to meet the borrower’s ability to repay the loan. As part of this effort, the Bank employs software that tests each loan for qualified mortgage compliance. As a CDFI, the Bank is authorized to originate non-qualified mortgages. Non-qualified mortgages generally require greater down payments and have higher yields. The Bank generally limits one-to-four family loans to a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 90% for a purchase and 80% for a refinance, based on the lower of the purchase price or appraised value. The maximum loan term is 30 years, self-amortizing. As a portfolio lender, the Bank presently does not offer a fixed-rate product. The Bank currently offers mostly 5/1 and 5/5 adjustable rate loans that adjust based on a spread ranging between 2.75% to 3.00% over the one or five-year FHLBNY rate. The maximum amount by which the interest rate may increase generally is limited to 2% for the first two adjustments and 5% for the life of the loan. Multifamily and Nonresidential Loans. At $348.3 million, or 26.3% of the Bank’s total loan portfolio at December 31, 2021, loans secured by multifamily properties represent the Bank’s largest real estate lending category. The nonresidential portfolio accounts for $239.7 million, or 18.1% of the total loan portfolio, and represents the third largest concentration. Combined, the multifamily and nonresidential loan portfolios amount to $588.0 million, or 44.5% of the Bank’s total loan portfolio at December 31, 2021. The three largest loans were $17.9 million, $12.4 million and $10.5 million, with the two largest being multifamily residential, and the other being nonresidential. Of the total of $588.0 million in multifamily and nonresidential loans, 177 loans have balances in excess of $1.0 million and account for $436.4 million, or approximately 74.2%, of this lending concentration. In terms of geographical concentrations, $224.2 million, or 38.1%, are secured by properties located in Queens County, $133.6 million, or 22.7%, in Kings County, $82.3 million, or 14.0%, in Bronx County, $49.0 million, or 8.3%, in New York County, $24.9 million, or 4.2%, in Westchester County and $24.0 million, or 4.1%, in Nassau County. All other concentrations by county, which account for 8.5% of this category, have balances of $8.0 million or less. In the nonresidential portfolio, the overall mix is diverse in terms of property types, with the largest concentration being retail and wholesale at $90.9 million, or 37.9% of the portfolio, industrial and warehouse at $57.1 million, or 23.8%, offices at $27.1 million, or 11.3%, service, doctor, dentist, daycare and schools at $20.6 million, or 8.6%, hotels and motels at $14.7 million, or 6.1%, restaurants at $8.9 million, or 3.7%, churches at $8.8 million, or 3.7%, medical, nursing home and hospital at $8.8 million, or 3.7%, and the rest of the portfolio accounts for other property types, with none exceeding 1.0% as a portfolio concentration. The Bank considers a number of factors when originating multifamily and nonresidential mortgages. Loans secured by multifamily and nonresidential real estate generally have larger balances and involve a greater degree of risk than one-to-four family residential real estate loans. The primary concern in this type of lending is the borrower’s creditworthiness and the viability and cash flow potential of the property. Payments on loans secured by income-producing properties often depend on successful operation and management of the properties. As a result, repayment of such loans may be more subject to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy as compared to residential real estate loans. To address the risks involved, the Bank evaluates the qualifications and financial resources of the underlying principal(s) of the borrower, including credit history, profitability and expertise, as well as the value of cash flows and condition of the property securing the loan. When evaluating the qualifications of the borrower, the Bank considers the financial resources of the borrower, the experience of the underlying principal(s) of the borrower in owning or managing similar properties and the borrower’s payment history with the Bank and other financial institutions. In evaluating the property securing the loan, the factors considered include the net operating income of the mortgaged property before debt service and depreciation, the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value or purchase price of the mortgaged property (whichever is lower), and the debt service coverage ratio. All multifamily and nonresidential loans are supported by appraisals that conform to the Bank’s appraisal policy. The Bank generally limits the maximum LTVs on these loans to 75%, based on the lower of the purchase price or appraised value of the subject property (70% on the refinance of nonresidential properties such as retail spaces, office buildings, and warehouses) and a DSCR of 1.20%. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Bank adopted temporary guidelines lowering LTVs by 5 percentiles and increasing DSCRs by 10 percentiles. The maximum loan term ranges between 25 and 30 years. As is the Bank’s general policy, the Bank offers only adjustable rates on its multifamily and nonresidential mortgages ─ with adjustments based on a spread currently ranging between 2.75% to 3.00% over the five-year FHLBNY rate. 7 Construction and Land L oans . Construction and land loans totaled $ 134 . 7 million , o r 10 . 2 %, of the Bank’s total loan portfolio at December 31, 2021 , ( 34 projects) , with $ 116 . 6 million consisting of multifamily residential (2 7 projects ). In terms of geographical concentrations, $ 73 . 2 million , or 54 .3 %, are secured by properties located in Queens County, $ 33. 6 million , or 22 . 7 %, in Kings County, $ 7 . 0 million , or 5.2 % , in New York County and $ 5 . 2 million, or 3 . 8 %, in Bronx County. At December 31, 2021 , loans in process related to construction loans totaled $ 1 18 . 9 million . The Bank’s typical construction loan has a term of up to 24 months and contains: • a minimum of 5% contingency; • a minimum of 5% retainage; • a loan-to-cost ratio of 70% or less; • an end loan loan-to-value ratio of 65% or less; • an interest reserve; • guarantees of all owners / partners / shareholders of a closely held organization owning 20% or more of company stock or entity ownership; and • an option to convert to a permanent mortgage loan upon completion of the project. The Bank’s approach to the underwriting of construction loans is driven by five factors: analysis of the developer; analysis of the contractor; analysis of the project; valuation of the project; and evaluation of the source of repayment. The developer’s character, capacity and capital are analyzed to determine that the individual or entity has the ability to first complete the project and then either sell it or carry permanent financing. The general contractor is analyzed for reputation, sufficient expertise and capacity to complete the project within the allotted time. The project is analyzed in order to ensure that the project will be completed within a reasonable period of time according to the plans and specifications, and can either be sold, rented or refinanced once completed. All construction loans are supported by appraisals which conform to the Bank’s appraisal policy and affirm the value of the project both “As Is” and “As Completed.” Lastly, the Bank reviews the developer’s cash flow estimations for the project on an “As Completed” basis. These projections are compared to the appraiser’s estimates. Debt service coverage using projected rental net income must be at least 1.2x the estimated debt service when operating at stabilized levels. Upon closing of the construction loan, the Bank begins monitoring the project and funding requisitions for completed stages upon inspection and confirmation by third party firms, such as engineers, of the work performed and its value and quality. Conversion to permanent financing usually occurs upon a conversion underwriting and receipt of certificates of occupancy, as applicable. Construction lending involves additional risks when compared with permanent lending because funds are advanced upon the security of the project, which is of uncertain value prior to its completion. Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs, as well as the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation of real property, it is relatively difficult to evaluate accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan-to-value ratio. In addition, during the term of our construction loans, no payment from the borrower is required since the accumulated interest is added to the principal of the loan through an interest reserve. As a result of these uncertainties, construction lending often involves the disbursement of substantial funds, with repayment dependent, in part, on the success of the ultimate project rather than the ability of a borrower or guarantor to repay the loan. If we are forced to foreclose on a project prior to completion, there is no assurance that we will be able to recover the entire unpaid portion of the loan. In addition, we may be required to fund additional amounts to complete a project, and it may be necessary to hold the property for an indeterminate period of time subject to the regulatory limitations imposed by local, state or federal laws. Loans on land under development or held for future construction also pose additional risk because of the lack of income being produced by the property and the potential illiquid nature of the collateral . C&I Loans and Lines of Credit. C&I loans (excluding PPP loans) and lines of credit represent less than 1.0% of the Bank’s total loan portfolio at December 31, 2021. Unlike real estate loans, which are secured by real property, and whose collateral value tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial and industrial loans are of higher risk and typically are made on the basis of the borrower’s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower’s business. The collateral, such as accounts receivable, securing these loans may fluctuate in value. Although the Bank’s loan policy allows for the extension of secured and unsecured financing, the Bank usually seeks to obtain collateral when in initial discussions with potential borrowers. Unsecured credit facilities are made only to strong borrowers that possess established track records with the Bank (or come highly recommended) and are supported by guarantors. Guarantees are required of any 8 individual or entity owning or controlling 20% or more of the borrowing entity, with exceptions requiring approval from the Board of Directors. When credits are not secured by a specific lien on an asset, the Bank usually requires a general lien on all business assets as evidenced by a UCC filing. Pricing is typically based on the Wall Street Journal prime rate plus a spread driven by risk-rating variables. Underwriters are required to identify at least two sources of repayment, usually recommend that loans contain covenants, such as minimum debt service coverage ratios, minimum global debt service coverage ratios, maximum leverage ratios, 30-day “cleanups” or “clean-downs,” as applicable, and must require periodic financial reporting. In addition, every effort is made to set up borrowers with auto-debit for loan payments and strongly encourage them to maintain operating accounts at the Bank. Lines of credit are typically short-term facilities (12 months) that are provided for occasional or seasonal needs. They are extended to only qualifying borrowers who have established cash flow from operations and a clean credit history. At a minimum, a bi-annual 30-day clean-up, or 75% bi-annual pay-down period is required, although annually is preferred. A clean-up period generally is not required on amortizing secured lines. Guarantors, which are usually required, must have clean credit histories and a substantial outside net worth. Most lines contain an option to convert to a term loan upon maturity. Secured term loans are long-term facilities extended typically for the purpose of financing the purchase of a long term asset. At a minimum, they will be collateralized by the asset being purchased. They may also be secured by an existing long term business asset or outside collateral pledged by the guarantor or borrower. Unsecured term loans are usually extended only to well-known borrowers who have established strong cash flow from operations and a clean credit history. Although Bank policy allows term loans for up to ten years, the preference is to offer self-amortizing term loans based on a term of no more than five-to-seven years. Paycheck Protection Program. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) appropriated $349.0 billion for the PPP. O n April 24, 2020, the PPP received another $310.0 billion in funding. On December 27, 2020, the Economic Aid to Hard-Hit Small Businesses, Nonprofits and Venues Act (the “Economic Aid Act”) appropriated another $284 billion for both first and second draw PPP loans bringing the total appropriations for PPP loans to $943.0 billion. The PPP ended on May 31, 2021. PPP loans that meet SBA requirements may be forgiven in certain circumstances, are fully guaranteed by the SBA, have an initial term of up to five years and earn interest at rate of 1%. The Bank continues to expect a significant portion of these loans will ultimately be forgiven by the SBA in accordance with the terms of the program. Over the course of the PPP, the Bank originated a total of 5,340 PPP loans in the amount of $261.4 million. As of December 31, 2021, the Bank had 1,606 PPP loans outstanding totaling $136.8 million, or 10.3% of total loans. As of December 31, 2021, these loans had resulted in $11.7 million in deferred loan fees to be recognized over the life of the respective loans. Of this amount, $8.0 million has been recognized as processing fee income and $3.7 million remains to be recognized over the remaining life of the respective loans. Consumer Loans. Consumer loans generally have higher interest rates than mortgage loans. The risk involved in consumer loans fluctuates based on the type and nature of the collateral and, in certain cases, the absence of collateral. Consumer loans include passbook loans and other secured and unsecured loans that have been made for a variety of consumer purposes. As of December 31, 2021, there were $34.2 million, or 2.6% of total loans, in unsecured consumer loans, of which $33.9 million comprised of 59,180 individual loans were outstanding and are held by the Bank pursuant to its arrangement with Grain. In addition, there were $473,000 in loans with passbook collateral. 9 Loan Originations, Purchases and Sales .

(2) Includes $33.9 million of loans which were outstanding and serviced by the Bank pursuant to its arrangement with Grain at December 31, 2021. Loan Approval Procedures and Authority. The Bank’s total loans or extensions of credit to a single borrower or group of related borrowers cannot exceed, with specified exemptions, 15% of its total regulatory capital. The Bank’s lending limit as of December 31, 2021 was $23.5 million, with the ability to lend additional amounts up to 10% if the loans or extensions of credit are fully secured by readily-marketable collateral. At December 31, 2021, the Bank complied with these loans-to-one borrower limitations. At December 31, 2021, the Bank’s largest aggregate exposure to one borrower was $20.5 million with an outstanding balance of $17.9 million. The second and third largest exposures were $18.5 million and $18.0 million with outstanding balances of $14.9 million and $17.9 million, respectively. No other loan or loans-to-one borrower, individually or cumulatively, exceeded $15.8 million, or 56.0% of the lending limit. 11 The Bank’s real estate lending is subject to written policies, underwriting standards and operating procedures. Decisions on loan requests are made on the basis of detailed applications submitted by the prospective borrower, credit histories that the Bank obtains and property valuations, consistent with the appraisal policy. The appraisals are prepared by outside independent licensed appraisers and reviewed by third parties, all approved by the Board of Directors. The Loan Committee usually reviews appraisals in considering a loan application. The performance of the appraisers is also subject to internal evaluations using scorecards and are assessed periodically. The loan applications are designed primarily to determine the borrower’s ability to repay the requested loan, and all information provided with the application and checklists provided as part of the application package are evaluated by the loan underwriting department. The real estate lending approval process starts with the processing of the application package, which is reviewed for completeness and then all necessary agency reports are ordered. Upon initial review and preparation of preliminary documents by the processors in the underwriting department, the file is assigned to an underwriter. The underwriters are responsible for presenting the loan request along with a recommendation, to the Loan Committee, and to the Board of Directors when the credit exposure is greater than the Loan Committee’s authority or there are exceptions to the loan policy. If approved, closed and booked, the loan reviewers then undertake the responsibility of monitoring the credit file for the life of the loan by assessing the borrower’s creditworthiness periodically, given certain criteria and following certain operating procedures. An independent third party also performs loan reviews following similar criteria and scope under the oversight of the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The Bank’s non-real estate lending is also subject to written policies, underwriting standards and operating procedures. Decisions on these loans requests are made on the basis of applications submitted by the prospective borrowers credit histories that the Bank obtains where applicable, borrower cash flows, as obtained directly from bank statements and predictive algorithms based on expected cash flows. Certain of these loans maybe wholly or partly collateralized by cash or business assets. Loans Held for Sale. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Bank did not originate loans with the intent of selling them into the secondary market. During the year ended December 31, 2021, Mortgage World loans held for sale, at fair value, included residential mortgages that were originated in accordance with secondary market pricing and underwriting standards. Mortgage World’s intent was to sell these loans on the secondary market. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 4.7% of Mortgage World total originated loan volume was insured and approximately 83.0% of total originated loan volume was sold to three investors. Mortgage World was permitted to close loans in five states and closed approximately 98.6% of its loan volume in New York and New Jersey. Delinquencies and Non-Performing Assets Delinquency Procedures. Collection efforts commence the day following the grace period, normally on the 17 th of the month. Those loans that have experienced sporadic late payments over the previous 12 months are reviewed with a greater degree of diligence. Late notices are generated and distributed on the 17 th and 30 th day of the month. The Collection Department pursues collection efforts up until the 90th day past due. At that time, the Bank usually will initiate legal proceedings for collection or foreclosure unless it is in the best interest of the Bank to work further with the borrower to arrange a suitable workout plan. Prior to acquiring property through foreclosure proceedings, the Bank will obtain an updated appraisal to determine the fair market value and proceed with net adjustments according to accounting principles. Board of Directors approval is required to pursue a foreclosure. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Bank collected $81,000 and $100,000, respectively, of interest income on non-accruing troubled debt restructured loans, of which $5,000 and $7,000, respectively, was recognized into income. The remaining interest collected on non-accruing troubled debt restructured loans for these periods was applied as a principal reduction for the remaining life of the loan, or until the loan is deemed performing. 12 Delinquent Loans. The following table sets forth the Bank’s loan delinquencies, including non-accrual loans, by type and amount at the dates indicated.

Federal regulations provide for the classification of loans and other assets, such as debt and equity securities, considered by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) to be of lesser quality, as “substandard,” “doubtful” or “loss.” An asset is considered “substandard” if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged, if any. “Substandard” assets include those characterized by the “distinct possibility” that the Bank will sustain “some loss” if the deficiencies are not corrected. Assets classified as “doubtful” have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified “substandard,” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make “collection or liquidation in full,” on the basis of currently existing facts, conditions, and values, “highly questionable and improbable.” Assets classified as “loss” are those considered “uncollectible” and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss allowance is not warranted. Assets which do not currently expose the Bank to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories but possess weaknesses are designated as “special mention” by our management. Under OCC regulations, when an insured institution classifies problem assets as either substandard or doubtful, it may establish general allowances in an amount deemed prudent by management to cover probable accrued losses. General allowances represent loss allowances which have been established to cover probable accrued losses associated with lending activities, but which, unlike specific allowances, have not been allocated to particular problem assets. When an insured institution classifies problem assets as “loss,” it is 14 required either to establish a specific allowance for losses equal to 100% of that portion of the asset so classified or to charge-off such amount. An institution’s determination as to the classification of its assets and the amount of its valuation allowances is subject to review by the regulatory authorities, which may require the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances. In connection with the filing of the Bank’s periodic reports with the OCC and in accordance with its classification of assets policy, it regularly reviews the loans in its portfolio to determine whether any loans require classification in accordance with applicable regulations. On the basis of this review of loans, the Bank’s classified and special mention loans at the dates indicated were as follows: At December 31, 2021 2020 2019 2018 2017 (in thousands) Classified Loans: Substandard $ 17,317 $ 20,508 $ 22,787 $ 18,665 $ 22,999 Total classified loans 17,317 20,508 22,787 18,665 22,999 Special mention loans 13,798 19,546 17,355 14,394 5,317 Total classified and special mention loans $ 31,115 $ 40,054 $ 40,142 $ 33,059 $ 28,316 Substandard loans decreased $3.2 million, or 15.6%, to $17.3 million at December 31, 2021 compared to $20.5 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease of substandard loans was primarily attributable to decreases of $2.7 million in nonresidential loans and $2.5 million in multifamily loans, offset by increases of $1.1 million in 1-4 family loans and $917,000 in construction and land loans. Special mention loans decreased $5.7 million, or 29.4%, to $13.8 million at December 31, 2021 compared to $19.5 million at December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily attributable to $10.6 million in construction and land loans and $514,000 in 1-4 family loans, offset by an increase of $5.3 million in multifamily loans. Troubled Debt Restructured Loans. The Bank occasionally modifies loans to help borrowers stay current on their loans and to avoid foreclosure. The Bank considers modifications only after analyzing a borrower’s current repayment capacity, evaluating the strength of any guarantors based on documented current financial information, and assessing the current value of any collateral pledged. The Bank generally does not forgive principal or interest on loans, but may do so if it is in its best interest and increases the likelihood that it can collect the remaining principal balance. The Bank may modify the terms of loans to lower interest rates, which may be at below market rates, to provide for fixed interest rates on loans where fixed rates are otherwise not available, or to provide for interest-only terms. These modifications are made only when there is a reasonable and attainable workout plan that has been agreed to by the borrower and is in the Bank’s best interests. At December 31, 2021, there were 30 loans modified as troubled debt restructured loans totaling $8.7 million. Of these, six troubled debt restructured loans, totaling $2.5 million, were included in non-accrual loans and the remaining 24 troubled debt restructured loans, totaling $6.2 million, had been performing in accordance with their modified terms for a minimum of six months since the date of restructuring and are accruing interest. At December 31, 2020, there were 32 loans modified as troubled debt restructured loans totaling $9.7 million. Of these, seven troubled debt restructured loans totaling $3.1 million were included in non-accrual loans and the remaining 25 troubled debt restructured loans, totaling $6.6 million, had been performing in accordance with their modified terms for a minimum of six months since the date of restructuring. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no loans modified to troubled debt restructured. Under the CARES Act, COVID-19 related modifications to loans that were current as of December 31, 2019 were exempt from troubled debt restructured classification under GAAP. In addition, the bank regulatory agencies issued interagency guidance stating that COVID-19 related short-term modifications (i.e., six months or less) for loans that were current as of the loan modification program implementation date were not troubled debt restructured. As of December 31, 2021, 4 loans in the aggregate amount of $8.0 million remained subject to this exemption and were in forbearance as a result renewed forbearance. The permitted use of this relief expired on January 1, 2022 and the Bank has made appropriate adjustments which are not material. Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses 15 The Bank has approved and maintained an appropriate, systematic and consistently applied process to determine the dollar amounts of the allowance for loan and lease losses (“ALLL”) that is adequate to absorb inherent losses in the loan portfolio and other held financial instruments. An inherent loss, as defined by U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”), and applicable banking regulations, is an unconfirmed loss that probably exists based on the information that is available as of the evaluation date. It is not a loss that may arise from events that might occur as a result of a possible future event. Arriving at an appropriate allowance involves a high degree of management’s judgment, is inevitably imprecise, and results in a range of possible losses. The determination of the dollar amounts of the ALLL is based on management’s current judgments about the credit quality of the loan portfolio taking into consideration all known relevant internal and external factors that affect loan payments at the end of each month. The dollar amounts reported each month for the ALLL are reviewed at least quarterly by the Board of Directors. To ensure that the methodology remains appropriate for the Bank, the Board of Directors periodically has the methodology validated externally and causes revisions to be made when appropriate. The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors oversees and monitors the internal controls over the ALLL determination process. The Bank adheres to a safe and sound banking practice by maintaining, analyzing, and supporting an adequate ALLL in accordance with GAAP and supervisory guidance. The Bank’s ALLL methodology consists of a system designed and implemented to estimate loan and lease losses. The Bank’s ALLL methodology incorporates management’s current judgments about the credit quality of the loan and lease portfolio through a disciplined and consistently applied process. The Bank’s loan policy requires the following when the Bank calculates the level of ALLL: • All loans shall be taken into consideration in the ALLL methodology whether on an individual or group basis. • The Bank shall identify all loans to be evaluated for impairment on an individual basis under ASC 310 and segment the remainder of the loan portfolio into groups (pools) of loans with similar risk characteristics for evaluation and analysis under ASC 450. • All known relevant internal and external factors that may affect the collection of the loan shall be taken into consideration. • All known relevant internal and external factors that may affect loan collectability shall be considered and applied consistently; however, when appropriate, these factors may be modified for new factors affecting loan collectability. • The particular risks inherent in different kinds of lending shall be taken into consideration. • The current collateral values, less the costs to sell, shall be taken into consideration when applicable. • The Bank shall require that competent and well-trained personnel perform the analysis, estimates, reviews and other ALLL methodology functions. • The ALLL methodology shall be based on current and reliable information. • The ALLL methodology shall be well documented, in writing, with clear explanations of the supporting analyses and rationale. The ALLL methodology shall include a systematic and logical method to consolidate the loss estimates and ensure the ALLL balance is recorded in accordance with GAAP. Loan pools with similar risk characteristics . Loss histories are the starting point for the calculation of ALLL balances. Loss histories are calculated for each of the pools by aggregating the historical losses less recoveries within the respective pools and annualizing the number over the determined length of time. The length of time may vary according to the relevance of past periods’ experience to the current period, among other considerations. The Bank currently uses a prior twelve quarter rolling average for its historical loss rates . Each pool’s historical loss rate is adjusted for the effects of the qualitative or environmental factors. The factors analyzed include: • Changes in lending policies and procedures, including changes in underwriting standards and collection, charge-off, and recovery practices. 16 • Changes in international, national, regional, and local economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectability of the portfolio, including the condition of various market segments. • Changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio and in the terms of loans. • Changes in the experience, ability and depth of lending management and other relevant staff. • Changes in the volume and severity of past due loans, the volume of nonaccrual loans, and the volume and severity of adversely classified or graded loans. • Changes in the quality of the Bank’s loan review system. • Changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral-dependent loans. • The existence and effect of any concentration of credit, and changes in the level of such concentrations. • The effect of other external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the Bank’s existing portfolio. The Bank utilizes a risk-based approach to determine the appropriate adjustments for each qualitative factor. A matrix containing definitions of low, medium, and high risk levels is used to assess the individual factors to determine their respective directional characteristics. These risk levels serve as the foundation for determining the individual adjustments for each factor for each pool of loans. The qualitative factor adjustments are supported by applicable reports, graphs, articles and any other relevant information to evidence and document management’s judgment as to the respective levels of risk and adjustment requirements. Each of the qualitative adjustment factors is applied to each of the loan pools to reflect adjustments that increase or decrease the historical loss rates applied to each loan pool. Each of these adjustment factors is individually supported and justified, and a discrete narrative for each loan pool reflects current information, events, circumstances and conditions influencing the adjustment. The narratives include descriptions of each factor, management’s analysis of how each factor has changed over time, which loan pool’s loss rates have been adjusted, the amount by which loss estimates have been adjusted for changes in conditions, an explanation of how management estimated the impact, and other available data that support the reasonableness of the adjustments. Once these qualitative adjustment factors are determined for each pool of loans, they are added to the historical loss numbers for each corresponding pool of loans to arrive at a loss factor for each pool based on historical loss experience and qualitative or environmental influences. These loss factors are adjusted to appropriately reflect the respective risk rating categories within each pool by applying the weighting factors described above to those loans within the respective pool’s risk rates. The series of calculations described above can be expressed as the following equation: [(H*P) + (Q*P)] = R, where H = Historical loss factor for the pool Q = Qualitative/Environmental aggregate adjustment for the pool P = Total loans within the pool R = Required reserve amount for the risk rating category within the pool Specific allowances for identified problem loans . The Bank considers a loan to be impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. All troubled debt restructured loans and loans on non-accrual status are deemed to be impaired. A specific valuation allowance is established for the impairment amount of each loan, calculated using the present value of expected cash flows, observable market price, or the fair value of the collateral, in accordance with the most likely means of recovery. 17 Factors evaluated in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. The Bank determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower’s prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. An unallocated component may be maintained to cover uncertainties that could affect our estimate of probable losses. The unallocated component of the allowance reflects the margin of imprecision inherent in the underlying assumptions used in the methodologies for estimating allocated and general reserves in the portfolio. Validation of the ALLL . The Bank considers its ALLL methodology valid when it accurately estimates the amount of probable loss contained in the loan portfolio. The Bank has employed procedures, including the following, when validating the reasonableness of its ALLL methodology and determining whether there may be deficiencies in its overall methodology or loan grading process: • A review of trends in loan volume, delinquencies, loan restructurings and concentrations. • A review of previous charge-offs and recovery history, including an evaluation of the timeliness of the entries to record both the charge-offs and the recoveries. • At a minimum, an annual review by a third party that is independent of the ALLL estimation process. • An evaluation of the appraisal process of the underlying collateral. The Bank supports the independent validation process with the work papers from the ALLL review function and may include the summary findings of an independent reviewer. The Board reviews the findings and acknowledges its review in the minutes of its meeting. If the methodology is changed based upon the findings of the validation process, the documentation that describes and supports the changes is maintained. As an integral part of its examination process, the OCC will periodically review the Bank’s allowance for loan losses. Following such review, the Bank may determine that it is appropriate to recognize additions to the allowance based on its judgment and information available to it at the time of such examination. Current expected credit losses. On June 16, 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standard Update 2016-13 , Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326), Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments , the current expected credit losses (“CECL”) standard. In October 2019, the FASB voted to defer implementation of the standard for non-public business entities and smaller reporting companies, such as the Company, to fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. In response to the new model, the Bank has reassessed its risk management policies and procedures in order for it to successfully implement CECL. Once adopted, the Bank will have to estimate the allowance for loan losses on expected losses rather than incurred losses. The Bank has engaged a third-party service provider that already has a meaningful data set for measurement in order to develop a rigorous framework for the application of reasonable and supportable forecasts as it relates to CECL. 18 The following table sets forth activity in the allowance for loan losses for the periods indicated.

The following table sets forth the allowance for loan and lease losses by loan category and the percent of the allowance in each category to the total allowance at the dates indicated. The allowance for loan and lease losses of each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses in any particular category and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in other categories.

The allowance for loan and lease losses increased to $16.4 million at December 31, 2021 from $14.9 million at December 31, 2020. There were $1.2 million in net charge-offs during the year ended December 31, 2021 and $98,000 in net recoveries during the year ended December 31, 2020. 20 Although the Bank believes that it uses the best information available to establish the ALLL , future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary and results of operations could be adversely affected if circumstances differ substantially from the assumptions used in making the determinations , as occurred in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic . Furthermore, although the Bank believes that it has established the ALLL in conformity with GAAP, after a review of the loan portfolio by regulators, the Bank may determine it is appropriate to increase the ALLL . In addition, because future events affecting borrowers and collateral cannot be predicted with certainty, the existing ALLL may not be adequate and increases may be necessary should the quality of any loan or lease deteriorate as a result of the factors discussed above. Any material increase in the ALLL may adversely affect the Bank’s financial condition and results of operations. Investment Activities General . The Bank’s investment policy was adopted and is reviewed annually by the Board of Directors. The Chief Financial Officer (designated as the Chief Investment Officer) will plan and execute investment strategies consistent with the policies approved by the Board of Directors. The Chief Financial Officer provides an investment schedule detailing the investment portfolio which is reviewed at least quarterly by the Bank’s asset-liability committee and the Board of Directors. The current investment policy permits, with certain limitations, investments in United States Treasury securities; securities issued by the U.S. government and its agencies or government-sponsored enterprises including mortgage-backed and collateralized mortgage obligations (“CMO”) issued by Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae and Freddie Mac; and corporate bonds and obligations, and certificates of deposit in other financial institutions. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the investment portfolio consisted of available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities and obligations issued by the U.S. government and government-sponsored enterprises, corporate bonds and the FHLBNY stock. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Bank owned $6.0 million and $6.4 million, respectively, of FHLBNY stock. As a member of FHLBNY, the Bank is required to purchase stock from the FHLBNY which is carried at cost and classified as restricted equity securities. Securities Portfolio Composition . The following table sets forth the amortized cost and estimated fair value of the available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities portfolios at the dates indicated, which consisted of U.S. government and federal agencies, corporate bonds, pass-through mortgage-backed securities and certificates of deposit.

At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no securities of which the amortized cost or estimated value exceeded 10% of total equity . 21 Mortgage-Backed Securities . At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Bank had mortgage-backed securities with a carrying value of $91.9 million and $8.7 million, respectively. Mortgage-backed securities are securities issued in the secondary market that are collateralized by pools of mortgages. Certain types of mortgage-backed securities are commonly referred to as “pass through” certificates because the underlying loans are “passed through” to investors, net of certain costs, including servicing and guarantee fees. Mortgage-backed securities typically are collateralized by pools of one-to-four family residential or multifamily residential mortgages, although the Bank invests primarily in mortgage-backed securities backed by one-to-four family residential mortgages. The issuers of such securities sell the participation interests to investors such as the Bank. The interest rate of the security is lower than the interest rates of the underlying loans to allow for payment of servicing and guaranty fees. All of the Bank’s mortgage-backed securities are backed by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, which are government-sponsored enterprises, or Ginnie Mae, which is a government-owned enterprise. Residential mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises are more liquid than individual mortgage loans because there is an active trading market for such securities. In addition, residential mortgage-backed securities may be used to collateralize borrowings. Investments in residential mortgage-backed securities involve a risk that actual payments will be greater or less than the prepayment rate estimated at the time of purchase, which may require adjustments to the amortization of any premium or accretion of any discount relating to such interests, thereby affecting the net yield on the securities. Current prepayment speeds determine whether prepayment estimates require modification that could cause amortization or accretion adjustments. Portfolio Maturities and Yields . The composition and maturities of the investment securities portfolio at December 31, 2021 are summarized in the following table. Maturities are based on the final contractual payment dates, and do not reflect the effect of scheduled principal repayments, prepayments, or early redemptions that may occur. Adjustable-rate mortgage-backed securities are included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust.

Sources of Funds General . Deposits have traditionally been the Bank’s primary source of funds for use in lending and investment activities. The Bank also uses borrowings, primarily from the FHLBNY, brokered and listing service deposits, and unsecured lines of credit with correspondent banks, to supplement cash flow needs, lengthen the maturities of liabilities for interest rate risk and manage the cost of funds. In addition, the Bank receives funds from scheduled loan payments, investment principal and interest payments, maturities and calls, loan prepayments and income on earning assets. Although scheduled loan payments and income on earning assets are relatively stable sources of funds, deposit inflows and outflows can vary widely and are influenced by prevailing interest rates, market conditions and levels of competition. Deposits . Deposits are generated primarily from the Bank’s primary market area. The Bank offers a selection of deposit accounts, including demand accounts, NOW/IOLA accounts, money market accounts, reciprocal deposits, savings accounts and certificates of deposit to individuals, business entities, non-profit organizations and individual retirement accounts. Deposit account terms vary, with the primary differences being the minimum balance required, the amount of time the funds must remain on deposit and the interest rate. 22 Interest rates paid, maturity terms, service fees and premature withdrawal penalties are established on a periodic basis. Deposit rates and terms are based primarily on current operating strategies and market rates, liquidity requirements, rates paid by competitors and growth goals. The Bank relies upon personalized customer service, long-standing relationships with customers and the favorable image of the Bank in the community to attract and retain deposits. The Bank also provides a fully functional electronic banking platform, including mobile application s , remote deposit capture and online bill pay, among others, as a service to retail and business customers. The flow of deposits is influenced significantly by general economic conditions, changes in money market and other prevailing interest rates and competition. The ability to attract and maintain these and other interest-bearing deposits, and the rates paid on them, have been, and will continue to be, significantly affected by competition and economic and market conditions.

At December 31, 2021, passbook savings accounts and certificates of deposit with a passbook feature totaled $146.7 million, reflecting depositors’ preference for traditional banking services. Borrowings . The Bank may obtain advances from the FHLBNY by pledging as security its capital stock at the FHLBNY and certain of its mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities. Such advances may be made pursuant to several different credit programs, each of which has its own interest rate and range of maturities. To the extent such borrowings have different terms to repricing than the Bank’s deposits, they can change the Bank’s interest rate risk profile. At December 31, 2021 and 2020 the Bank had $106.3 million and $117.3 million of outstanding FHLBNY advances, respectively. Additionally, the Bank has an unsecured line of credit in the amount of $25.0 million with a correspondent bank, of which none was outstanding at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The Bank also had a guarantee from the FHLBNY through letters of credit in an amount of up to $21.5 million and $61.5 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Warehouse Line of Credit . Mortgage World maintained two warehouse lines of credit with financial institutions for the purpose of funding the origination and sale of residential mortgages. The lines of credit were repaid with proceeds from the sale of the mortgage loans. The lines were secured by the assets collaterizing underlying mortgages originated by Mortgage World. The agreements with the warehouse lenders provided for certain restrictive covenants such as minimum net worth and liquidity ratios. All warehouse facilities were guaranteed by Mortgage World. As of December 31, 2021, Mortgage World was in full compliance with all financial covenants. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, Mortgage World utilized $15.1 million and $30.0 million for funding of loans held for sale and had unused line of credit of $14.9 million and $4.9 million, respectively. The Bank anticipates maintaining these warehouse lines of credit. 24 The following table sets forth information concerning balances and interest rates on borrowings at the dates and for the periods indicated. At or For the Years December 31, 2021 2020 2019 (Dollars in Thousands) FHLBNY Advances: Balance outstanding at end of period $ 106,255 $ 117,255 $ 104,404 Average amount outstanding during the period 108,005 116,947 81,404 Maximum outstanding at any month-end during the period 109,255 152,284 169,404 Weighted average interest rate during the period 2.02 % 2.03 % 2.32 % Weighted average interest rate at the end of the period 2.02 % 1.90 % 2.21 % Warehouse Lines of Credit: Balance outstanding at end of period $ 15,090 $ 29,961 $ — Average amount outstanding during the period 11,675 8,461 — Maximum outstanding at any month-end during the period 16,385 29,961 — Weighted average interest rate during the period 3.29 % 3.34 % — Weighted average interest rate at the end of the period 3.21 % 3.37 % — Personnel At December 31, 2021, the Bank and Mortgage World had a total of 217 full-time equivalent employees of which 44 full-time equivalent employees related to Mortgage World. At December 31, 2020, the Bank and Mortgage World had a total of 227 full-time equivalent employees of which 46 full-time equivalent employees related to Mortgage World. Employees are not represented by any collective bargaining group. Subsidiaries At December 31, 2021, the Company had two subsidiaries, Ponce Bank and Mortgage World, and Ponce Bank had one subsidiary, Ponce de Leon Mortgage Corp., a New York State chartered mortgage brokerage entity, whose employees are registered in New York and New Jersey. Ponce Bank had a subsidiary, PFS Services, Corp., which was merged into Ponce de Leon Mortgage Corp. on December 31, 2021. Regulation and Supervision General As a federally-chartered, stock savings association, the Bank is subject to examination, supervision and regulation, primarily by the OCC, and, secondarily, by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) as the insurer of deposits. The federal system of regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which the Bank is engaging and is intended primarily for the protection of depositors and the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund. The Bank is regulated to a lesser extent by the Federal Reserve Board which governs the reserves to be maintained against deposits and other matters. In addition, the Bank is a member of and owns stock in the FHLBNY, which is one of the 11 regional banks in the Federal Home Loan Bank System. The Bank’s relationship with its depositors and borrowers is also regulated, to a great extent, by federal law and, to a lesser extent, state law, including in matters concerning the ownership of deposit accounts and the form and content of loan documents. As a savings and loan holding company, the Company is subject to examination and supervision by, and is required to file certain reports with, the Federal Reserve Board. The Company is subject to the rules and regulations of the SEC under the federal securities laws. Mortgage World was a mortgage banking entity which primarily operated in the New York City metropolitan area. It was a Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”) approved Title II lender. To maintain its license, Mortgage World needed to comply with certain regulations set forth by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”). Mortgage World was subject to the comprehensive regulation and examination of the New York State Department of Financial Services. 25 Set forth below are certain material regulatory requirements that are applicable to the Company and the Bank. This description of statutes and regulations is not intended to be a complete description of such statutes and regulations and their effects on the Company and the Bank. Any change in these laws or regulations, whether by Congress or the applicable regulatory agencies, could have a material adverse impact on the Company and the Bank and their respective operations. CARES Act In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the CARES Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020. Among other things, the CARES Act includes provisions impacting financial institutions like the Bank. The CARES Act allowed banks to elect to suspend requirements under GAAP for loan modifications related to the COVID-19 pandemic (for loans that were not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019) that would otherwise be categorized as a TDR, including impairment for accounting purposes, until the earlier of 60 days after the termination date of the national emergency or December 31, 2020. This relief was extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act enacted on December 27, 2020 to the earlier of January 1, 2022 or 60 days after the termination of the national emergency. This relief was not extended beyond January 1, 2022 and the Bank has made appropriate adjustments which are not material. Federal banking agencies were required to defer to the determination of the banks making such suspension. The CARES Act created the PPP. The PPP authorized small business loans to pay payroll and group health costs, salaries and commissions, mortgage and rent payments, utilities, and interest on certain debt. The loans were provided through participating financial institutions, such as Bank, that processed loan applications and service the loans. The CARES Act appropriated $349.0 billion for PPP loans. On April 24, 2020, the PPP received another $310.0 billion in funding. On December 27, 2020, the Economic Aid Act appropriated another $284.0 billion for both first and second draw of PPP loans bringing the total appropriations for PPP loans to $943.0 billion. Loans under the PPP that meet SBA requirements may be forgiven in certain circumstances, and are 100% guaranteed by the SBA. The authorization for making PPP loans expired on May 31, 2021. Federal Bank Regulations Business Activities . A federal savings association derives its lending and investment powers from the Home Owners’ Loan Act, as amended, and applicable federal regulations. Under these laws and regulations, the Bank may invest in mortgage loans secured by residential and commercial real estate, commercial business and consumer loans, certain types of debt securities and certain other assets, subject to applicable limits. The Bank may also establish, subject to specified investment limits, service corporation subsidiaries that may engage in certain activities not otherwise permissible for Ponce Bank, including real estate investment and securities and insurance brokerage. Examinations and Assessments . The Bank is primarily supervised by the OCC. The Bank is required to file reports with and is subject to periodic examination by the OCC. The Bank is required to pay assessments to the OCC to fund the agency’s operations. The Company is required to file reports with and is subject to periodic examination by the Federal Reserve Board. It is also required to pay assessments to the Federal Reserve Board to fund the agency’s operations. Capital Requirements . Federal regulations require FDIC-insured depository institutions, including federal savings associations, to meet several minimum capital standards: a common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio, a Tier 1 capital to risk-based assets ratio, a total capital to risk-based assets and a Tier 1 capital to total assets leverage ratio. The existing capital requirements were effective January 1, 2015 and are the result of a final rule implementing regulatory amendments based on recommendations of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and certain requirements of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”). The capital standards require the maintenance of common equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 4.5%, 6.0% and 8.0%, respectively. The regulations also establish a minimum required leverage ratio of at least 4.0% Tier 1 capital. Common equity Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common stockholders’ equity and retained earnings. Tier 1 capital is generally defined as common equity Tier 1 and Additional Tier 1 capital. Additional Tier 1 capital generally includes certain noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus and minority interests in equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries. Total capital includes Tier 1 capital (common equity Tier 1 capital plus Additional Tier 1 capital) and Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 capital is comprised of capital instruments and related surplus meeting specified requirements, and may include cumulative preferred stock and long-term perpetual preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, intermediate preferred stock and subordinated debt. Also included in Tier 2 capital is the allowance for loan and lease losses limited to a maximum of 1.25% of risk-weighted assets and, for institutions that have exercised an opt-out election regarding the treatment of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (“AOCI”), up to 45% of net unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair market values. In 2015, Ponce De Leon Federal Bank, the predecessor of Ponce Bank, made a one-time, permanent election to opt-out regarding the treatment of AOCI. Institutions that have not exercised the AOCI opt-out have AOCI incorporated into common equity Tier 1 capital (including unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale-securities). Calculation of all types of regulatory capital is subject to deductions and adjustments specified in the regulations. 26 In determining the amount of risk-weighted assets for purposes of calculating risk-based capital ratios, an institution’s assets, including certain off-balance sheet assets (e.g., recourse obligations, direct credit substitutes, residual interests), are multiplied by a risk weight factor assigned by the regulations based on the risk deemed inherent in the type of asset. Higher levels of capital are required for asset categories believed to present greater risk. For example, a risk weight of 0.0% is assigned to cash and U.S. government securities, a risk weight of 50.0% is generally assigned to prudently underwritten first lien one-to-four family residential mortgages, a risk weight of 100.0% is assigned to commercial and consumer loans, a risk weight of 150.0% is assigned to certain past due loans and a risk weight of between 0.0% to 6 00.0% is assigned to permissible equity interests, depending on certain specified factors. In addition to establishing the minimum regulatory capital requirements, the regulations limit capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management if the institution does not hold a “capital conservation buffer” consisting of 2.5% of common equity Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets above the amount necessary to meet its minimum risk-based capital requirements. The capital conservation buffer requirement is 2.5% of risk-weighted assets. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Bank’s capital exceeded all applicable requirements. See Note 14, “Regulatory Capital Requirements” of the Notes to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Loans-to-One Borrower . Generally, a federal savings association may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of 15.0% of unimpaired capital and surplus. An additional amount may be lent, equal to 10.0% of unimpaired capital and surplus, if secured by “readily marketable collateral,” which generally includes certain financial instruments (but not real estate). As of December 31, 2021, the Bank was in compliance with the loans-to-one borrower limitations. Standards for Safety and Soundness . Federal law requires each federal banking agency to prescribe certain standards for all insured depository institutions. These standards relate to, among other things, internal controls, information systems, audit systems, loan documentation, credit underwriting, interest rate risk exposure, asset growth, compensation and other operational and managerial standards as the agency deems appropriate. Interagency pronouncements set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired. If the appropriate federal banking agency determines that an institution fails to meet any standard prescribed by the pronouncements, the agency may require the institution to submit to the agency an acceptable plan to achieve compliance with the standard. Failure to implement such a plan can result in further enforcement action, including the issuance of a cease and desist order or the imposition of civil money penalties. Prompt Corrective Action Regulations . Under the Federal Prompt Corrective Action statute, the OCC is required to take supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions under its jurisdiction, the severity of which depends upon the institution’s level of capital. A savings institution that has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0%, a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 4.5% or a leverage ratio of less than 4.0% is considered to be “undercapitalized.” A savings institution that has total risk-based capital of less than 6.0%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0%, a common equity Tier 1 ratio of less than 3.0% or a leverage ratio that is less than 3.0% is considered to be “significantly undercapitalized.” A savings institution that has a tangible capital to assets ratio equal to or less than 2.0% is deemed to be “critically undercapitalized.” Generally, the OCC is required to appoint a receiver or conservator for a federal savings association that becomes “critically undercapitalized” within specific time frames. The regulations also provide that a capital restoration plan must be filed with the OCC within 45 days of the date that a federal savings association is deemed to have received notice that it is “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized” or “critically undercapitalized.” Any holding company of a federal savings association that is required to submit a capital restoration plan must guarantee performance under the plan in an amount of up to the lesser of 5.0% of the savings association’s assets at the time it was deemed to be undercapitalized by the OCC or the amount necessary to restore the savings association to adequately capitalized status. This guarantee remains in place until the OCC notifies the savings association that it has maintained adequately capitalized status for each of four consecutive calendar quarters. Institutions that are undercapitalized become subject to certain mandatory measures such as restrictions on capital distributions and asset growth. The OCC may also take any one of a number of discretionary supervisory actions against undercapitalized federal savings associations, including the issuance of a capital directive and the replacement of senior executive officers and directors. 27 At December 31, 2021 , the Bank met the criteria for being considered “well capitalized,” which means that its total risk-based capital ratio exceeded 10.0%, its Tier 1 risk-based ratio exceeded 8.0%, its common equity Tier 1 ratio exceeded 6.5% and its leverage ratio exceeded 5.0 %. Qualified Thrift Lender Test . As a federal savings association, the Bank must satisfy the qualified thrift lender, or “QTL,” test. Under the QTL test, the Bank must maintain at least 65% of its “portfolio assets” in “qualified thrift investments” (primarily residential mortgages and related investments, including mortgage-backed securities) in at least nine months of every 12-month period. “Portfolio assets” generally means total assets of a savings association, less the sum of specified liquid assets up to 20% of total assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, and the value of property used in the conduct of the savings association’s business. Alternatively, the Bank may satisfy the QTL test by qualifying as a “domestic building and loan association” as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. A savings association that fails the qualified thrift lender test must operate under specified restrictions set forth in the Home Owners’ Loan Act. The Dodd-Frank Act made noncompliance with the QTL test subject to agency enforcement action for a violation of law. At December 31, 2021, the Bank satisfied the QTL test. Capital Distributions . Federal regulations govern capital distributions by a federal savings association, which include cash dividends, stock repurchases and other transactions charged to the savings association’s capital account. A federal savings association must file an application with the OCC for approval of a capital distribution if: • the total capital distributions for the applicable calendar year exceeds the sum of the savings association’s net income for that year to date plus the savings association’s retained net income for the preceding two years; • the savings association would not be at least adequately capitalized following the distribution; • the distribution would violate any applicable statute, regulation, agreement or regulatory condition; or • the savings association is not eligible for expedited treatment of its filings. Even if an application is not otherwise required, every savings association that is a subsidiary of a savings and loan holding company, such as the Bank, must file a notice with the Federal Reserve Board at least 30 days before its board of directors declares a dividend. An application or notice related to a capital distribution may be disapproved if: • the federal savings association would be undercapitalized following the distribution; • the proposed capital distribution raises safety and soundness concerns; or • the capital distribution would violate a prohibition contained in any statute, regulation or agreement. In addition, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act provides that an insured depository institution shall not make any capital distribution if, after making such distribution, the institution would fail to meet any applicable regulatory capital requirement. A federal savings association also may not make a capital distribution that would reduce its regulatory capital below the amount required for the liquidation account established in connection with its conversion to stock form. Community Reinvestment Act and Fair Lending Laws . All federal savings associations have a responsibility under the Community Reinvestment Act and related regulations to help meet the credit needs of their communities, including low and moderate-income borrowers. In connection with its examination of a federal savings association, the OCC is required to assess the federal savings association’s record of compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act. A savings association’s failure to comply with the provisions of the Community Reinvestment Act could, at a minimum, result in denial of certain corporate applications, such as branches or mergers, or in restrictions on its activities. In addition, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act prohibit lenders from discriminating in their lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes. The failure to comply with the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and the Fair Housing Act could result in enforcement actions by the OCC, as well as other federal regulatory agencies and the Department of Justice. 28 The Community Reinvestment Act requires all institutions insured by the FDIC to publicly disclose their rating. Ponce Bank, received a “satisfactory” Community Reinvestment Act rating in its most recent federal examination. Transactions with Related Parties . As a federal savings association, the Bank’s authority to engage in transactions with its affiliates is limited by Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and federal regulation. An affiliate is generally a company that controls, or is under common control with an insured depository institution such as the Bank. The Company is an affiliate of the Bank because of its control of the Bank. In general, transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates are subject to certain quantitative limits and collateral requirements. In addition, federal regulations prohibit a savings association from lending to any of its affiliates that are engaged in activities that are not permissible for bank holding companies and from purchasing the securities of any affiliate, other than a subsidiary. Finally, transactions with affiliates must be consistent with safe and sound banking practices, not involve the purchase of low-quality assets and be on terms that are as favorable to the institution as comparable transactions with non-affiliates. The Bank’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10.0% stockholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is currently governed by the requirements of Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O of the Federal Reserve Board. Among other things, these provisions generally require that extensions of credit to insiders: • be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features; and • not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the Bank’s capital. In addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by the Bank’s Board of Directors. Extensions of credit to executive officers are subject to additional limits based on the type of extension involved. Enforcement . The OCC has primary enforcement responsibility over federal savings associations and has authority to bring enforcement action against all “institution-affiliated parties,” including directors, officers, stockholders, attorneys, appraisers and accountants who knowingly or recklessly participate in wrongful action likely to have an adverse effect on a federal savings association. Formal enforcement action by the OCC may range from the issuance of a capital directive or cease and desist order to removal of officers and/or directors of the institution and to the appointment of a receiver or conservator. Civil money penalties (“CMP”) cover a wide range of violations and actions. CMPs are classified into three tiers based on the actionable conduct and the level of culpability. The law sets maximum amounts that the OCC may assess for each day the actionable conduct continues. The FDIC also has the authority to terminate deposit insurance or recommend to the OCC that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular federal savings association. If such action is not taken, the FDIC has authority to take the action under specified circumstances. Insurance of Deposit Accounts . The Deposit Insurance Fund of the FDIC insures deposits at FDIC insured financial institutions such as the Bank. Deposit accounts in the Bank are insured by the FDIC generally up to a maximum of $250,000 per separately insured depositor and up to a maximum of $250,000 for self-directed retirement accounts. The FDIC charges insured depository institutions premiums to maintain the Deposit Insurance Fund. The Dodd-Frank Act required the FDIC to base its assessments upon each insured institution’s total assets less tangible equity. The FDIC has set the assessment range at 1.5 to 40 basis points of total assets less tangible equity. Assessments for most institutions are based on financial measures and supervisory ratings derived from statistical modeling estimating the probability of failure within three years. The FDIC has authority to increase insurance assessments. Any significant increases would have an adverse effect on the operating expenses and results of operations of the Bank. Management cannot predict what assessment rates will be in the future. Insurance of deposits may be terminated by the FDIC upon a finding that an institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law, regulation, rule, order or condition imposed by the FDIC. We do not currently know of any practice, condition or violation that may lead to termination of the Bank’s deposit insurance. Federal Reserve System Generally, Federal Reserve Board regulations require depository institutions to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and regular checking accounts). In an effort to respond to the negative effects on the economy from the COVID-19 pandemic, effective March 26, 2020, the Federal Reserve Board eliminated the reserve requirement for depository institutions in order to support lending to households and businesses. 29 Federal Home Loan Bank System The Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which consists of 11 regional Federal Home Loan Banks. The Federal Home Loan Bank System provides a central credit facility primarily for member institutions as well as other entities involved in home mortgage lending. As a member of the FHLBNY, the Bank is required to acquire and hold shares of the capital stock of the FHLBNY. As of December 31, 2021, the Bank was in compliance with this requirement. The Bank may also utilize advances from the FHLBNY as a source of investable funds. Other Regulations Interest and other charges collected or contracted for by the Bank are subject to state usury laws and federal laws concerning interest rates. The Bank’s operations are also subject to federal laws applicable to credit transactions, such as the: • Truth-In-Lending Act, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers; • Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, requiring financial institutions to provide information to enable the public and public officials to determine whether a financial institution is fulfilling its obligation to help meet the housing needs of the community it serves; • Equal Credit Opportunity Act, prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, creed or other prohibited factors in extending credit; • Fair Credit Reporting Act, governing the use and provision of information to credit reporting agencies; • Fair Debt Collection Act, governing the manner in which consumer debts may be collected by collection agencies; • Truth in Savings Act, mandating certain disclosures to depositors; and • Rules and regulations of the various federal agencies charged with the responsibility of implementing such federal laws. The operations of the Bank are subject to the: • Right to Financial Privacy Act, which imposes a duty to maintain confidentiality of consumer financial records and prescribes procedures for complying with administrative subpoenas of financial records; • Electronic Funds Transfer Act and Regulation E promulgated thereunder, which govern automatic deposits to and withdrawals from deposit accounts and customers’ rights and liabilities arising from the use of automated teller machines and other electronic banking services; • Check Clearing for the 21st Century Act (also known as “Check 21”), which gives “substitute checks,” such as digital check images and copies made from that image, the same legal standing as the original paper check; • The USA PATRIOT Act, which requires financial institutions to, among other things, establish broadened anti-money laundering compliance programs, and due diligence policies and controls to ensure the detection and reporting of money laundering. Such required compliance programs are intended to supplement existing compliance requirement that also apply to financial institutions under the Bank Secrecy Act and the Foreign Assets Control regulations; • The Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which places limitations on the sharing of consumer financial information by financial institutions with unaffiliated third parties. Specifically, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act requires all financial institutions offering financial products or services to retail customers to provide such customers with the financial institution’s privacy policy and provide such customers the opportunity to “opt out” of the sharing of certain personal financial information with unaffiliated third parties; and • The Dodd-Frank Act made significant changes to the regulatory structure for depository institutions and their holding companies and also affected the lending, investments and other operations of all depository institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to set minimum capital levels for both bank holding companies and savings and loan holding companies that are as stringent as those required for their insured depository subsidiaries. The Dodd-Frank Act created a new regulator, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), and gave it broad powers to supervise and enforce consumer protection laws. The CFPB has broad rule-making authority for a wide range of consumer protection laws 30 that apply to all banks and savings institutions, such as Ponce Bank, including the authority to prohibit “unfair, deceptive or abusive” acts and practices. Holding Company Regulations General . The Company is a unitary savings and loan holding company within the meaning of the Home Owners’ Loan Act. As such, the Company is registered with the Federal Reserve Board and are subject to the regulation, examination, supervision and reporting requirements applicable to savings and loan holding companies. In addition, the Federal Reserve Board has enforcement authority over the Company and its non-savings association subsidiaries, if any. Among other things, this authority permits the Federal Reserve Board to restrict or prohibit activities of those entities that are determined to be a serious risk to the subsidiary savings institution. Permissible Activities . Under present law, the business activities of the Company are generally limited to those activities permissible for financial holding companies under Section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, provided certain conditions are met and financial holding company status is elected, or for multiple savings and loan holding companies. A financial holding company may engage in activities that are financial in nature, including underwriting equity securities and insurance, as well as activities that are incidental to financial activities or complementary to a financial activity . A multiple savings and loan holding company is generally limited to activities permissible for bank holding companies under Section 4(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act, subject to regulatory approval, and certain additional activities authorized by federal regulations. The Company’s predecessor was designated as a financial holding company. The Company anticipates that it will elect financial holding company status and request Federal Reserve Board notification of effectiveness. Federal law prohibits a savings and loan holding company, including the Company , directly or indirectly, or through one or more subsidiaries, from acquiring more than 5.0% (“control”) of another savings institution or savings and loan holding company, without prior Federal Reserve Board approval. The Federal Reserve Baord adopted a final rule on January 30, 2020, effective April 1, 2020, providing further guidance regarding under what circumstances “control” will be found to exist. In evaluating applications by holding companies to acquire savings institutions, the Federal Reserve Board considers factors such as the financial and managerial resources, future prospects of the company and institution involved, the effect of the acquisition on the risk to the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund, the convenience and needs of the community and competitive factors. The Federal Reserve Board is prohibited from approving any acquisition that would result in a multiple savings and loan holding company controlling savings institutions in more than one state, subject to two exceptions: • the approval of interstate supervisory acquisitions by savings and loan holding companies; and • the acquisition of a savings institution in another state if the laws of the state of the target savings institution specifically permit such acquisition. Capital. Savings and loan holding companies had historically not been subjected to consolidated regulatory capital requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act required the Federal Reserve Board to establish minimum consolidated capital requirements that are as stringent as those required for the insured depository subsidiaries. However, pursuant to legislation passed in December 2014, the Federal Reserve Board extended to savings and loan holding companies the applicability of its “Small Bank Holding Company” exception to its consolidated capital requirements and, pursuant to a law enacted in May 2018, increased the threshold for the exception to $3.0 billion. As a result, savings and loan holding companies with less than $3.0 billion in consolidated assets, such as the Company, are generally not subject to the capital requirements unless otherwise advised by the Federal Reserve Board. Source of Strength. The Dodd-Frank Act extended the “source of strength” doctrine to savings and loan holding companies. The Federal Reserve Board has issued regulations requiring that all savings and loan holding companies serve as a source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions. Dividends and Stock Repurchases . The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement regarding the payment of dividends by holding companies. In general, the policy provides that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if the prospective rate of earnings retention by the holding company appears consistent with the organization’s capital needs, asset quality and overall supervisory financial condition. Separate regulatory guidance provides for prior consultation with Federal Reserve Bank staff concerning dividends in certain circumstances such as where the company’s net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the company’s overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with the company’s capital needs and overall financial condition. The ability of a savings and loan holding company to pay dividends may be restricted if a subsidiary savings association becomes undercapitalized. The regulatory guidance also states that a savings and loan holding company should inform Federal Reserve Bank supervisory staff prior to redeeming or repurchasing common stock or perpetual preferred stock if the savings and loan holding company is experiencing financial weaknesses or the repurchase or redemption would result in a net reduction, at the end of a quarter, in the amount of such equity instruments outstanding compared with 31 the beginning of the quarter in which the redemption or repurchase occurred. These regulatory policies may affect the ability of the Company to pay dividends, repurchase shares of common stock or otherwise engage in capital distributions. Acquisition. Under the Federal Change in Bank Control Act, a notice must be submitted to the Federal Reserve Board if any person (including a company), or group acting in concert, seeks to acquire direct or indirect “control” of a savings and loan holding company. Under certain circumstances, a change of control may occur, and prior notice is required, upon the acquisition of 10% or more of the company’s outstanding voting stock, unless the Federal Reserve Board has found that the acquisition will not result in control of the company. A change in control definitively occurs upon the acquisition of 25% or more of the company’s outstanding voting stock. Under the Change in Bank Control Act, the Federal Reserve Board generally has 60 days from the filing of a complete notice to act, taking into consideration certain factors, including the financial and managerial resources of the acquirer and the competitive effects of the acquisition. The Federal Reserve Board adopted a final rule on January 30, 2020, effective April 1, 2020, providing further guidance regarding under what circumstances “control” will be found to exist. Federal Securities Laws The Company ’s common stock is registered with the SEC under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”). The Company is subject to the public disclosure, proxy solicitation, insider trading restrictions and other requirements under the Exchange Act. Securities and Exchange Commission Proposal On March 21, 2022, the SEC proposed new ‎rules (the ""Proposal"") that, if finalized, will require reporting companies, such as the Company, to disclose ‎climate-related risks, metrics, and other information in their audited financial ‎statements, registration statements, annual reports (such as Form 10-K) and other ‎SEC filings. The Proposal builds upon earlier SEC climate risk disclosure guidance and in many ‎ways draws upon recommendations by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial ‎Disclosures, as well as accounting and reporting standards from the ‎Greenhouse Gas Protocol. Through these approaches, the SEC says it is seeking to ‎provide a ""consistent, comparable, and reliable"" structure for the measurement, ‎tracking, and reporting of greenhouse gas (""GHG"") risks and emissions. Even for companies ‎currently tracking GHG emissions, it is likely that the Proposal will not only materially ‎increase requirements associated with tracking and quantification of GHGs, but also ‎impose further layers of disclosure obligations. For those companies that do not ‎currently measure, track and report such metrics, the new rules likely will present a ‎significant and potentially costly new disclosure regime that could require major management and reporting changes. For all ‎reporting companies, compliance with the breadth of the Proposal will require significant ‎coordination between a business's operational, financial, and environmental functions.‎ The Proposal establishes different levels of compliance and timing of the effectiveness of compliance for reporting companies. For SEC purposes, the Company is presently a smaller reporting company which would give it the most time to comply. No assurance can be given what, if any, form the final regulation may take. Emerging Growth Company Status The Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (the “JOBS Act”), which was enacted in April 2012, made numerous changes to the federal securities laws to facilitate access to capital markets. Under the JOBS Act, a company with total annual gross revenues of less than $1.07 billion during its most recently completed fiscal year qualifies as an “emerging growth company.” The Company qualifies as an emerging growth company under the JOBS Act. For so long as the Company is an “emerging growth company” it may choose not to hold stockholder votes to approve annual executive compensation (more frequently referred to as “say-on-pay” votes) or executive compensation payable in connection with a merger (more frequently referred to as “say-on-golden parachute” votes). An emerging growth company also is not subject to the requirement that its auditors attest to the effectiveness of the company’s internal control over financial reporting, and can provide scaled disclosure regarding executive compensation. The Company is also not subject to the auditor attestation requirement or additional executive compensation disclosure so long as it remains a “smaller reporting company” under SEC regulations (public float less than $250 million of voting and non-voting equity held by non-affiliates). Finally, an emerging growth company may elect to comply with new or amended accounting pronouncements in the same manner as a private company, but must make such election when the company is first required to file a registration statement. Such an election is irrevocable during the period a company is an emerging growth company. The Company has elected to comply with new or amended accounting pronouncements in the same manner as a private company. The Company will cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earlier of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year of the Company during which it had total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion (adjusted for inflation) or more; (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of PDL Community Bancorp’s initial stock offering in 2017; (iii) the date on which the Company has, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; or (iv) the date on which 32 the C ompany is deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under SEC regulations ( public float at least $700 million of voting and non-voting equity held by non-affiliates). Taxation The Company and the Bank are subject to federal and state income taxation in the same general manner as other corporations, with some exceptions discussed below. The following discussion of federal and state taxation is intended only to summarize material income tax matters and is not a comprehensive description of the tax rules applicable to the Company and the Bank. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company was subject to U.S. federal income tax, New York State income tax, Connecticut income tax, New Jersey income tax, Florida income tax, Pennsylvania income tax and New York City income tax. The Company is generally no longer subject to examination by taxing authorities for years before 2018. Federal Taxation Method of Accounting . For federal income tax purposes, the Bank currently reports its income and expenses on the accrual method of accounting and uses a tax year ending December 31 for filing its federal income tax returns. For the year ended December 31, 2021, t he Company, the Bank and Mortgage World file a consolidated federal income tax return. The Small Business Protection Act of 1996 eliminated the use of the reserve method of accounting for income taxes on bad debt reserves by savings institutions. For taxable years beginning after 1995, Ponce De Leon Federal Bank, the predecessor of Ponce Bank, and Ponce Bank have been subject to the same bad debt reserve rules as commercial banks. The Bank currently utilizes the specific charge-off method under Section 582(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. Net Operating Loss Carryovers . A financial institution may not carry back net operating losses (“NOL”) to earlier tax years. The NOL can be carried forward indefinitely. The use of NOLs to offset income is limited to 80%. The CARES Act allows NOLs generated in 2018, 2019 and 2020 to be carried back to each of the five preceding tax years. The Bank, did not generate NOLs in 2018, 2019 or 2020 so no carryback is available. At December 31, 2021, the Bank had no federal NOL carryforwards. State Taxation The Company is treated as a financial institution under Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey state income tax law. The states of Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey subject financial institutions to all state and local taxes in the same manner and to the same extent as other business corporations in Connecticut, New York and New Jersey. Additionally, depository financial institutions are subject to local business license taxes and a special occupation tax. Florida and Pennsylvania treated Mortgage World as a separate business corporation. Consolidated Group Return . With tax years beginning after January 1, 2015, New York State and New York City require unitary combined reporting for all entities engaged in a unitary business that meet certain ownership requirements. All applicable entities meet the ownership requirements in the Bank filing group and a combined return is appropriately filed. Furthermore, New Jersey changed its tax laws and now requires combined reporting for tax years that end on or after July 31, 2019 for entities that engage in a unitary business. Single Entity Return. The Company will also file entity returns in the states of Florida and Pennsylvania for Mortgage World for 2021. Net Operating Loss Carryovers . The state and city of New York allow for a three-year carryback period and carryforward period of twenty years on net operating losses generated on or after tax year 2015. For tax years prior to 2015, no carryback period is allowed. Ponce De Leon Federal Bank, the predecessor of Ponce Bank, has pre-2015 carryforwards of $600,000 for New York State purposes and $500,000 for New York City purposes. Furthermore, there are post-2015 carryforwards available of $34.2 million for New York State purposes and $14.3 million for New York City purposes. Finally, for New Jersey purposes, losses may only be carried forward 20 years, with no allowable carryback period. At December 31, 2021, the Bank had no New Jersey net operating loss carryforwards.

You should read this entire document carefully, including the Risk Factors below that discusses the above risks in further detail. Risks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have negatively affected the global economy, United States economy, our local economy and our markets and has disrupted our operations, which has impacted our business, financial condition and results of operations. The spread of COVID-19 has created a global public health crisis that has periodically resulted in uncertainty, volatility and deterioration in financial markets and in governmental, commercial and consumer activity including in the United States, where we conduct substantially all of our activity. At various times since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, our businesss and the business of some of our customers have been disrupted and adversely impacted. The current wave of COVID-19 related to the Omicron variant has begun to subside in the United States. Government restrictions have been allowed to lapse and commercial and consumer activity has largely resumed. However, the pandemic is continuing and to the extent cases were to once again surge, government restrictions could be reinstated, which, along with independent actions of individuals and businesses aimed at slowing a new surge, may again negatively impact economic activity and disrupt our and our customers’ businesses. Further, if new strains or variants of COVID-19 develop or boosters of the COVID-19 vaccines or other treatments are not widely administered or available for a significant period of time or otherwise prove ineffective, the adverse impact of COVID-19 on the economy, and, in turn, our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations could be material. In support of our business customers, the Bank participated in the SBA PPP, a guaranteed unsecured loan program enacted under the CARES ACT, to provide near-term relief to help small businesses impacted by COVID-19 sustain operations. Under this program, the Bank originated 5,340 PPP loans for new and existing customers of which 1,606 loans totaling $136.8 million were outstanding at December 31, 2021. We also have implemented various consumer and commercial loan modification programs to provide our borrowers relief from the economic impacts of COVID-19 in the form of payment deferral of principal and interest under the CARES Act. Based on guidance in the CARES Act, COVID-19 related modifications to loans that were current as of December 31, 2019 were exempt until January 1, 2022 from troubled debt restructured (“TDR”) classification under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“U.S. GAAP”). In addition, the bank regulatory agencies issued interagency guidance stating that COVID-19 related short-term modifications (i.e., six months or less) granted to loans that were current as of the loan modification program implementation date were not TDRs. As of December 31, 2021, four loans in the amount of $8.0 million remained in forbearance as a result of renewed forbearance. Of the four loans receiving renewed forbearance, one loan in the amount of $6.6 million is related to construction real estate, two loans, totaling $1.0 million are related to one-to-four family residential real estate and one loan in the amount of $391,000 is related to non-residential properties. All of these loans had been performing in accordance with their contractual obligations prior to the granting of the initial forbearance. The Company continues to monitor and make adjustments in the way it provides services to its deposit customers while seeking to maintain normal day-to-day back-office operations and lending functions. In order to protect the health of our customers and employees, and to comply with changing government directives, the Company continue to modify its business practices, including alternating employees working from home and in the office, and continue monitoring business continuity plans and protocols to the extent appropriate. In this regard, all back-office and lending personnel alternate working from home and in the office while the branch network continues to provide traditional banking services to its communities and has for the most part returned to normal operating hours while continuing to shift service delivery to electronic and web-based products. The Company continues its extensive and intensive communications program geared to informing customers of the alternative resources provided by the Company for retaining access to financial services, closing loans and conducting banking transactions, such as ATM networks, online banking, mobile applications, remote deposits and the Company’s Contact Center. The Company also proactively manages its day-to-day operations by using video and telephonic conferencing. 34 The extent to which COVID-19 pandemic affects our credit quality, business, operations and financial condition, as well as our regulatory capital, liquidity ratios and credit ratings, is uncertain and unpredictable and depends on, among other things, new information that may emerge concerning the scope, duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other parties in response to the pandemic. Risks Related to Russia—Ukraine Conflict. The impact of the military action in Ukraine may affect our business. On February 24, 2022, Russian forces launched significant military action against Ukraine, and sustained conflict and disruption in the region is possible. The impact to Ukraine as well as actions taken by other countries, including new and stricter sanctions imposed by Canada, the United Kingdom, the European Union, the U.S. and other countries and companies and organizations against officials, individuals, regions, and industries in Russia, and actions taken by Russia in response to such sanctions, and each country’s potential response to such sanctions, tensions, and military actions could have a material adverse effect on our operations. We have no way to predict the progress or outcome of the situation, as the conflict and government reactions are rapidly developing and beyond our control. Prolonged unrest, military activities, or broad-based sanctions, should they be implemented, could have a material adverse effect on the global, U.S. and local economics. The information contained in this section is accurate as of the date hereof, but may become outdated due to changing circumstances beyond our present awareness or control. Risks Related to our Lending Activities. We have increased our multifamily, nonresidential and construction and land loans, and intend to continue to increase originations of these types of loans. These loans may carry greater credit risk than loans secured by one-to-four family real estate that could adversely affect our financial condion and net income. Our focus is primarily on prudently growing our multifamily, nonresidential and construction and land loan portfolio. At December 31, 2021, $722.6 million, or 54.7%, of our loan portfolio consisted of multifamily, nonresidential and construction and land loans as compared to $632.2 million, or 53.9%, of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2020. Because the repayment of multifamily, nonresidential and construction and land loans depends on the successful management and operation of the borrower’s properties or related businesses, repayment of such loans can be affected by adverse conditions in the local real estate market or economy. A downturn in the real estate market or the local economy could adversely impact the value of properties securing the loan or the revenues from the borrower’s business, thereby increasing the risk of non-performing loans. In addition, many of our commercial real estate loans are not fully amortizing and require large balloon payments upon maturity. Such balloon payments may require the borrower to either sell or refinance the underlying property in order to make the payment, which may increase the risk of default or nonpayment. Further, the physical condition of non-owner occupied properties may be below that of owner occupied properties due to lax property maintenance standards, which have a negative impact on the value of the collateral properties. As our multifamily, nonresidential and construction and land loan portfolios increase, the corresponding risks and potential for losses from these loans may also increase. Given their larger balances and the complexity of the underlying collateral, multifamily, nonresidential and construction and land loans generally expose a lender to greater credit risk than loans secured by one-to-four family real estate. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose us to significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one-to-four family residential real estate loan. In addition, any adverse developments with respect to borrowers or groups of borrowers that have more than one of these types of loans outstanding can expose us to significantly greater risk of loss compared to borrowers or groups of borrowers that only have one type of these loans. If loans that are collateralized by real estate or other business assets become troubled and the values of the underlying collateral have been significantly impaired, we may not be able to recover the full contractual amounts of principal and interest that we anticipated at the time we originated the loans, which could cause us to increase our provision for loan losses which would, in turn, adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Further, if we foreclose on this type of collateral, our holding period for that collateral may be longer than for one-to-four family real estate loans because there are fewer potential purchasers of that collateral, which can result in substantial holding costs. Some of our borrowers have more than one of these types of loans outstanding. At December 31, 2021, 61,903 loans with an aggregate balance of $1.1 billion are to borrowers with only one loan. Another 150 loans are to borrowers with two loans each with a corresponding aggregate balance of $149.0 million. In addition, there are 11 borrowers with three loans each with a corresponding aggregate balance of $22.7 million and one borrower with four loans with an aggregate balance of $516,000. There is one borrower with five loans with an aggregate balance of $906,000. 35 During periods of sl ower economic growth or challenging economic periods like those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, small to medium-sized businesses , which make up the majority of our customers, may be impacted more severely and more quickly than larger businesses. Inflationary Pressures and Rising Prices for Goods and Services, Including Energy. Inflation rose sharply at the end of 2021 and has continued rising in 2022 at levels not seen for over 40 years. Inflationary pressures are currently expected to remain elevated throughout 2022. Small to medium-sized businesses may be impacted more during periods of high inflation as they are not as able to leverage economics of scale to mitigate cost pressures compared to larger businesses. Consequently, the ability of many of our business customers to repay their loans may deteriorate, and in some cases this deterioration may occur quickly, which would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition The unseasoned nature of our multifamily, nonresidential and construction and land loans portfolio may result in changes to our estimates of collectability, which may lead to additional provisions or charge-offs, which could hurt our profits. Our multifamily, nonresidential and construction and land loan portfolio has increased approximately $90.4 million, or 14.3%, to $722.6 million at December 31, 2021 from $632.2 million at December 31, 2020 and increased approximately $75.4 million, or 13.5%, to $632.2 million at December 31, 2020 from $556.8 million at December 31, 2019. A large portion of our multifamily, nonresidential and construction and land loan portfolio is unseasoned and does not provide us with a significant payment or charge-off history pattern from which to judge future collectability. Currently, we estimate potential charge-offs using a rolling 12 quarter average and peer data adjusted for qualitative factors specific to us. As a result, it may be difficult to predict the future performance of this part of our loan portfolio. These loans may have delinquency or charge-off levels above our historical experience or current estimates, which could adversely affect our future performance. Further, these types of loans generally have larger balances and involve a greater risk than one-to-four family owner-occupied residential mortgage loans. Accordingly, if we make any errors in judgment in the collectability of our multifamily, nonresidential and construction and land loans, any resulting charge-offs may be larger on a per loan basis than those incurred historically with our residential mortgage loans. Our business may be adversely affected by credit risk associated with residential property. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, one-to-four family residential real estate loans amounted to $414.3 million and $418.4 million, or 31.3% and 35.7%, respectively, of our total loan portfolio. Of these amounts, $317.3 million and $319.6 million, or 76.6% and 76.4%, respectively, is comprised of one-to-four family residential investor-owned properties. One-to-four family residential mortgage lending, whether owner-occupied or non-owner occupied is generally sensitive to regional and local economic conditions that significantly impact the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations. Declines in real estate values could cause some of our one-to-four family residential mortgages to be inadequately collateralized, which would expose us to a greater risk of loss if we seek to recover on defaulted loans by selling the real estate collateral. One-to-four family residential mortgage lending, whether owner-occupied or non-owner-occupied, with higher combined loan-to-value ratios are more sensitive to declining property values than those with lower combined loan-to-value ratios and therefore may experience a higher incidence of default and severity of losses. In addition, if the borrowers sell their properties, they may be unable to repay their loans in full from the sale proceeds. For those home equity loans and lines of credit secured by a second mortgage, it is unlikely that we will be successful in recovering all or a portion of our loan proceeds in the event of default unless we are prepared to repay the first mortgage loan and such repayment and the costs associated with a foreclosure are justified by the value of the property. In addition, the current judicial and legal climate makes it difficult to foreclose on residential properties expeditiously and with reasonable costs. For these reasons, we may experience higher rates of delinquencies, default and losses on our one-to-four family residential mortgage loans. We have made initial and extended forbearances to one-to-four family residential loans as short-term modifications made on a good faith basis in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and in furtherance of governmental policies. We actively monitor borrowers in forbearance and seek to determine their capacity to resume payments as contractually obligated upon the termination of the forbearance period. Loans secured by non-owner occupied properties generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than loans secured by owner occupied properties because repayment of such loans depend primarily on the tenant’s continuing ability to pay rent to the property owner, who is our borrower, or, if the property owner is unable to find a tenant, the property owner’s ability to repay the loan without the benefit of a rental income stream. In addition, the physical condition of non-owner occupied properties is often below that of owner occupied properties due to lax property maintenance standards, which has a negative impact on the value of the collateral properties. 36 Loans that we make through our FinTech partnerships may expose us to increased lending risk In 2020, the Company rolled out its first Fintech-based product in partnership with the startup company Grain. Grain’s product, is a mobile application geared to the underbanked and new generations entering the financial services market that uses non-traditional underwriting methodologies. Under the terms of its agreement with Grain, the Bank is the lender and depository for Grain-originated microloans and, where applicable, security deposits, to consumers, with credit lines currently up to $1,000. Grain originates and services the loans and is responsible for maintaining compliance with the Bank's origination and servicing standards. If a loan becomes 120 days delinquent upon 120 days of origination or due to a failure of Grain to properly service the loan, the Bank’s origination or servicing standards, respectively, will be deemed to have not been complied with and Grain will be responsible for any related losses. The Company, pursuant to its partnership with Grain, has 59,180 consumer loans with outstanding balances totaling $33.9 million at December 31, 2021. The Company is seeking to provide additional digital banking services to these customers and to extend Grain to its retail customers. We intend to continue growing this portfolio over the next several years. Our concentration guideline is to limit Grain loans in the aggregate to 50% of Tier 1 capital or $85.6 million at December 31, 2021. In the event Grain is unable to purchase loans put back to it as a result of not meeting the Banks's origination and servicing standards, the level we have provided for in our allowance for loan losses may be inadequate and we may need to increase our provision for loan losses, or may require us to charge off the value of such loans, which could materially decrease our net income. Additionally, Grain is a start-up company which entails inherently greater risk. Like other start-up companies, there is a higher level of risk that Grain may not be able to execute its business plan and may fail. In the event Grain were to cease operations, the Bank may have greater difficulty in collecting on loans held by the Bank and serviced by Grain and the Company’s equity investment in Grain may become impaired. If our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings and capital could decrease. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, our allowance for loan losses totaled $16.4 million and $14.9 million, which represented 1.24%, and 1.27% of total loans, respectively. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for many of our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we review our loans, loss and delinquency experience, and business and commercial real estate peer data, and we evaluate other factors including, but not limited to, current economic conditions. If our assumptions are incorrect, or if delinquencies or non-performing loans increase, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, which would require additions to our allowance, which in turn, could materially decrease our net income. The Financial Accounting Standards Board has delayed the effective date of the implementation of Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, standard. CECL will be effective for Ponce Financial and Ponce Bank on January 1, 2023. CECL will require financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans, and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for credit losses. This will change the current method of providing allowances for loan losses that are incurred or probable, which would likely require us to increase our allowance for credit losses, and to greatly increase the types of data we would need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses. In addition, our regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, periodically review the allowance for loan losses and, as a result of such reviews, we may determine that it is appropriate to increase the allowance for loan losses by recognizing additional provisions for loan losses charged to income, or to charge off loans, which, net of any recoveries, would decrease the allowance for loan losses. Any such additional provisions for loan losses or charge-offs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. A worsening of economic conditions in our market area could reduce demand for our products and services and/or result in increases in our level of nonperforming loans, which could adversely affect our operations, financial condition and earnings. Although there is not a single employer or industry in our market area on which a significant number of our customers are dependent, a substantial portion of our loan portfolio is composed of loans secured by property located in the greater New York metropolitan area. This can make us vulnerable to a downturn in the local economy and real estate markets. Adverse conditions in the local economy could have a significant impact on the ability of our borrowers to repay loans and the value of the collateral securing their loans, which could adversely impact our net interest income. Any deterioration in economic conditions, such as those which resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic or those that could result from the Russia—Ukraine conflict, could have the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations: • demand for our products and services may decline; • loan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures may increase; • collateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, thereby reducing customers’ future borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with existing loans; and 37 • the net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us. Moreover, a significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, acts of terrorism, an outbreak of hostilities, including the Russia—Ukraine conflict, a pandemic, including COVID-19, or other international or domestic calamities, unemployment or other factors beyond our control could further impact these local economic conditions and could further negatively affect the financial results of our banking operations. In addition, deflationary pressures, while possibly lowering our operating costs, could have a significant negative effect on our borrowers, especially our business borrowers, and the values of underlying collateral securing their loans, which could negatively affect our financial performance. We are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities or properties we own. A significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate, and we could become subject to environmental liabilities with respect to one or more of these properties, or with respect to properties that we own in operating our business. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing defaulted loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous conditions or toxic substances are found on these properties, we may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage, civil fines and criminal penalties regardless of when the hazardous conditions or toxic substances first affected any particular property. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses to address unknown liabilities and may materially reduce the affected property’s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability. Our policies, which require us to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on non-residential real property, may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards. The remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on us. Loans originated under the SBA Paycheck Protection Program subject us to credit, forgiveness and guarantee risk. We originated 5,340 PPP loans, of which 1,606 loans totaling $136.8 million were outstanding at December 31, 2021. The PPP loans are subject to the provisions of the CARES Act and to complex rules and guidance issued by the SBA and other government agencies. We expect that the great majority of our remaining PPP borrowers will seek full or partial forgiveness of their loan obligations. We have credit risk on PPP loans if the SBA determines that there is a deficiency in the manner in which we originated, funded or serviced loans, including any issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive a PPP loan. We could face additional risks in our administrative capabilities to service our PPP loans, and risk with respect to the determination of loan forgiveness, depending on the final procedures for determining loan forgiveness. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which we originated, funded or serviced a PPP loan, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty or, if the SBA has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from us. Risks Related to our Business Strategy. Our business strategy includes growth, and our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively. Growing our operations could also cause our expenses to increase faster than our revenues. Our business strategy includes growth in assets, loans, deposits and the scale of our operations. Achieving such growth will require us to attract customers that currently bank at other financial institutions in our market area. Our ability to successfully grow will depend on a variety of factors, including our ability to attract and retain experienced bankers, the continued availability of desirable business opportunities, competition from other financial institutions in our market area and our ability to manage our growth. Growth opportunities may not be available or we may not be able to manage our growth successfully. If we do not manage our growth effectively, our financial condition and operating results could be negatively affected. Furthermore, there can be considerable costs involved in expanding deposit and lending capacity that generally require a period of time to generate the necessary revenues to offset their costs, especially in areas in which we do not have an established presence and require alternative delivery methods. Accordingly, any such business expansion can be expected to negatively impact our earnings for some period of time until certain economies of scale are reached. Our expenses could be further increased if we encounter delays in modernizing existing facilities, opening of new branches or deploying new services. We may incur losses due to minority investments in other financial technology related companies. At December 31, 2021, we had invested $1.0 million in Grain. As part of our business strategy, we may from time to time make or consider making additional minority investments in Grain or other financial technology companies in the financial services business. We may not be able to influence the activities of companies in which we invest and may suffer losses due to these activities. 38 New lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks. From time to time, we may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business. In addition, we will continue to make investments in research, development, and marketing for new products and services. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In developing and marketing new lines of business and/or new products and services we may invest significant time and resources. Initial timetables for the development and introduction of new lines of business and/or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. Furthermore, if customers do not perceive our new offerings as providing significant value, they may fail to accept our new products and services. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives, and shifting market preferences, may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service. Furthermore, the burden on management and our information technology of introducing any new line of business and/or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our efficiency ratio is high, and we anticipate that it may remain high, as a result of the ongoing implementation of our business strategy. Our non-interest expense totaled $57.1 million and $47.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Although we continue to analyze our expenses and pursue efficiencies where available, our efficiency ratio remains high as a result of the implementation of our business strategy combined with operating in an expensive market. Our efficiency ratio was 61.13% and 86.09% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our efficiency ratio for the year ended December 31, 2021 improved compared with prior year due to the inclusion of $20.3 million in one-time gains, net of expenses, as a result of the sale and leaseback of real property. If we are unable to successfully implement our business strategy and increase our revenues, our profitability could be adversely affected. We have received approval of our application to the U.S. Treasury for an investment under the Emergency Capital Investment Program, in exchange for the issuance of senior perpetual preferred stock; we may not be able to effectively deploy the funds and it may present unanticipated and uncustomary issues. Our application with the U.S. Department of the Treasury (“Treasury”) for an investment by Treasury under the Emergency Capital Investment Program (“ECIP”), created pursuant to the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 has been approved in the amount of up to $186.5 million. Under the ECIP, Treasury will provide investment capital directly to depository institutions that are CDFIs or MDIs, such as the Bank, to provide loans, grants, and forbearance to small businesses, minority-owned businesses, and consumers in low-income and underserved communities . If made, Treasury’s investment would be in exchange for the Company issuing senior perpetual noncumulative preferred stock directly to Treasury on terms established by the Treasury. If Treasury makes the investment, we may not be able to effectively deploy the funds or do so in an appropriate time frame. The ECIP funds will put demands on our management team which may require the hiring of additional executives. Treasury will be a stockholder of the Company, which may present unanticipated and uncustomary issues. The issuance of senior preferred stock to the Treasury may affect our ability to pay dividends on our common stock. We are evaluating the proposed standard terms of the investment provided by the Treasury, as well as other considerations. We cannot provide any assurance or guarantee concerning what the actual terms, conditions and preferences of the senior preferred stock will be or whether they will be acceptable. For additional information, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Vision 2025 Evolves.” Risks Related to Competitive Matters Strong competition within our market areas may limit our growth and profitability. Competition in the banking and financial services industry is intense. In our market area, we compete with commercial banks, savings institutions, mortgage brokerage firms, credit unions, finance companies, mutual funds, insurance companies, brokerage and investment banking firms and unregulated or less regulated non-banking entities, operating locally and elsewhere. Many of these competitors have substantially greater resources and higher lending limits than we have and offer certain services that we do not or cannot provide. In addition, some of our competitors offer loans with lower interest rates on more attractive terms than loans we offer. Competition also makes it increasingly difficult and costly to attract and retain qualified employees. Our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area. If we must raise interest rates paid on deposits or lower interest rates charged on our loans, our net interest margin and profitability could be adversely affected. The financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of new legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Banks, securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial 39 holding company, which can offer virtually any type of financial service, including banking, securities underwriting, insurance (both agency and underwriting) and merchant banking. Also, technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for non-banks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks, such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems. Many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures. Additionally, due to their size, many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and, as a result, may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can. We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. For additional information see “Business —Market Area and —Competition.” Our small size makes it more difficult for us to compete. Our small asset size makes it more difficult to compete with other financial institutions that are larger and can more easily afford to invest in the marketing and technologies needed to attract and retain customers. Because our principal source of income is the net interest income we earn on our loans and investments after deducting interest paid on deposits and other sources of funds, our ability to generate the revenues needed to cover our expenses and finance such investments is limited by the size of our loan and investment portfolios. Accordingly, we are not always able to offer new products and services as quickly as our competitors. Our lower earnings may also make it more difficult to offer competitive salaries and benefits. In addition, our smaller customer base may make it difficult to generate meaningful non-interest income from such activities as securities and insurance brokerage. Finally, as a smaller institution, we are disproportionately affected by the continually increasing costs of compliance with new banking and other regulations. Risks Related to Our Management. We depend on our management team to implement our business strategy and execute successful operations and we could be harmed by the loss of their services. We are dependent upon the services of the members of our senior management team who direct our strategy and operations. Members of our senior management team, or lending personnel who possess expertise in our markets and key business relationships, could be difficult to replace. Our loss of these persons, or our inability to hire additional qualified personnel, could impact our ability to implement our business strategy and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our ability to compete in our markets. See “Management.” Adherence to our internal policies and procedures by management is critical to our performance and how we are perceived by our regulators. Our internal policies and procedures are a critical component of our corporate governance and, in some cases, compliance with applicable regulations. We adopt internal policies and procedures to guide management and employees regarding the operation and conduct of our business. We may not always achieve absolute compliance with all of our policies and procedures. Any deviation or non-adherence to these internal policies and procedures, whether intentional or unintentional, could have a detrimental effect on our management, operations or financial condition. Risks Related to Interest Rates. The historically low interest rate environment of the past several years is ending, interest rates are expected to rise and the possibility that we may access higher-cost funds to support our loan growth and operations may adversely affect our net interest income and profitability. The historically low benchmark federal funds interest rate of the last several years implemented in response the turmoil resulting from COVID-19 pandemic is ending. The Federal Reserve Board increased the benchmark federal funds interest rate by 25 basis points on March 16, 2022. The Federal Reserve Board has signaled that there will likely be additional federal funds interest rate increases during 2022; maybe as many as six more. The recent increase and the anticipated increases are in response to inflation rising at a rate not seen in over 40 years. Because of this rising rate environment, the speed with which it is anticipated to be implemented, the significant competitive pressures in our markets and the potential negative impact of these factors on our deposit and loan pricing, our net interest margin may be negatively impacted. Our net interest income may also be negatively impacted if the demand for loans decreases due to the rate increases, alone or in tandem with the concurrent inflationary pressures. We may be negatively impacted if we are unable to appropriately time adjustments to our funding costs and the rates we earn on our loans. The Bank believes it is well positioned to withstand this rising interest rate environment in the near term as it is asset sensitive. An important component of our ability to mitigate pressures of a rising rate environment will be our ability to prudently increase the rates we pay on deposits, including core deposits. If we were to increase these rates, because of competitive pricing pressures in our markets, liquidity purposes or otherwise, our net interest margin may be negatively impacted. In addition, as our growth in earning assets has outpaced growth in our core deposits in recent quarters, we have had to increase our reliance on noncore funding. These funding 40 sources may be more rate sensitive than our core depositors, and, accordingly, we may be compelled to increase the rates we pay on these funds which may limit our ability to maintain on-balance sheet liquidity levels consistent with our policies, which would negatively impact our net interest margin. We seek to limit the amount of non-core funding we utilize to support our growth. If we are unable to grow our core funding at rates that are sufficient to match or exceed our loan growth we may be required to slow our loan growth . As interest rates change, we expect that we will periodically experience “gaps” in the interest rate sensitivities of our assets and liabilities, meaning that either our interest-bearing liabilities (usually deposits and borrowings) will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than our interest-earning assets (usually loans and investment securities), or vice versa. In either event, if market interest rates should move contrary to our position, this “gap” may work against us, and our results of operations and financial condition may be negatively affected. We attempt to manage our risk from changes in market interest rates by adjusting the rates, maturity, repricing characteristics, and balances of the different types of our interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Interest rate risk management techniques are not exact. From time to time we reposition a portion of our investment securities portfolio in an effort to better position our balance sheet for potential changes in short-term rates. We employ the use of models and modeling techniques to quantify the levels of risks to net interest income, which inherently involve the use of assumptions, judgments, and estimates. While we strive to ensure the accuracy of our modeled interest rate risk profile, there are inherent limitations and imprecisions in this determination and actual results may differ. Future changes in interest rates could reduce our profits and asset values. Net income (loss) is the amount by which net interest income and non-interest income exceeds (or does not exceed) non-interest expense and the provisions for loan losses and taxes. Net interest income makes up a majority of our income and is based on the difference between: • the interest income we earn on interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities; and • the interest expense we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. The rates we earn on our assets and the rates we pay on our liabilities are generally fixed for a contractual period of time. Like many savings institutions, our liabilities generally have shorter contractual maturities than our assets. This imbalance can create significant earnings volatility because market interest rates change over time. In a period of rising interest rates, the interest income we earn on our assets may not increase as rapidly as the interest we pay on our liabilities as the demand for loans may decrease materially. In a period of declining interest rates, the interest income we earn on our assets may decrease more rapidly than the interest we pay on our liabilities, as borrowers prepay mortgage loans, and mortgage-backed securities and callable investment securities are called, requiring us to reinvest those cash flows at lower interest rates. In addition, the recent rate increase of 25 basis points, the first since 2018, combined with the outlook of up to six more rate increases during 2022 in an attempt to curb inflation, can affect the average life of loans and mortgage-backed and related securities. A rise in interest rates may result in lower demand for loans and mortgage-backed and related securities as borrowers may reduce their debts due to the higher costs of borrowings. Any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Changes in the level of interest rates also may negatively affect the value of our assets and ultimately affect our earnings. We monitor interest rate risk through the use of simulation models, including estimates of the amounts by which the economic value of our assets and liabilities (the Economic Value of Equity Model “EVE”) and our net interest income would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates. At December 31, 2021, in the event of an instantaneous 100 basis point increase in interest rates, we estimate that we would experience a 4.58% decrease in EVE and a 0.82% decrease in net interest income. For further discussion of how changes in interest rates could impact us, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Management of Market Risk—Net Interest Income Simulation Models and—Economic Value of Equity Model.” 41 Changes in the valuation of securities held could adversely affect us. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, our securities portfolio totaled $114.3 million and $19.2 million, which represented 6.9% and 1.4% of total assets, respectively. All of the securities in our portfolio as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were classified as available-for-sale with the exception of one security classified as held-to-maturity in the amount of $934,000 and $1.7 million, respectively. Accordingly, a decline in the fair value of our available-for-sale securities could cause a material decline in our reported equity and/or net income. At least quarterly, and more frequently when warranted by economic or market conditions, management evaluates all securities classified as available-for-sale with a decline in fair value below the amortized cost of the investment to determine whether the impairment is deemed to be other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”). For impaired debt securities that are intended to be sold, or more likely than not will be required to be sold, the full amount of market decline is recognized as OTTI through earnings. Credit-related OTTI for all other impaired debt securities is recognized through earnings. Non-credit related OTTI for debt securities is recognized in other comprehensive income net of applicable taxes. A decline in the market value of our securities portfolio could adversely affect our earnings. Risks Related to Laws and Regulations. Changes in laws and regulations and the cost of regulatory compliance with new laws and regulations may adversely affect our operations and/or increase our costs of operations. The Bank is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the OCC, and the Company is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve Board. Such regulation and supervision governs the activities in which the Bank and the Company may engage and are intended primarily for the protection of the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund, the depositors and borrowers of the Bank and consumers, rather than for our stockholders. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on our operations, the classification of our assets and influencing the level of our allowance for loan losses. These regulations, along with existing tax, accounting, securities, insurance and monetary laws, rules, standards, policies, and interpretations, control the methods by which financial institutions conduct business, implement strategic initiatives and tax compliance, and govern financial reporting and disclosures. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material impact on our operations. Further, changes in accounting standards can be both difficult to predict and involve judgment and discretion in interpretation by us. These changes could materially impact, potentially even retroactively, how we report our financial condition and results of operations. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) significantly changed the regulation of banks and savings institutions and affects the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The various federal agencies have adopted a broad range of rules and regulations in compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act. Compliance with the Dodd-Frank Act and its regulations and policies has resulted in changes to our business and operations, as well as additional costs, and has diverted management’s time from other business activities, all of which have adversely affected our financial condition and results of operations. Among other provisions recently enacted, the threshold to qualify for the Federal Reserve Board’s Small Bank Holding Company Policy Statement was increased to $3.0 billion and federally-chartered savings banks and associations have been provided flexibility to adopt the powers of a national bank. 42 Our New York State multi-family loan portfolio could be adversely impacted by changes in legislation or regulation. On June 14, 2019, the New York State legislature passed the Housing Stability and Tenant Protection Act of 2019, impacting about one million rent regulated apartment units. Among other things, the new legislation: (i) curtails rent increases from Material Capital Improvements and Individual Apartment Improvements; (ii) all but eliminates the ability for apartments to exit rent regulation; (iii) does away with vacancy decontrol and high-income deregulation; and (iv) repealed the 20% vacancy bonus. While it is difficult to measure the full impact of the legislation, in total, it generally limits a landlord's ability to increase rents on rent regulated apartments and makes it more difficult to convert rent regulated apartments to market rate apartments. As a result, the value of the collateral located in New York State securing our multi-family loans or the future net operating income of such properties could potentially become impaired. Non-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions. The USA PATRIOT and Bank Secrecy Acts require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are detected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions, including restrictions on conducting acquisitions or establishing new branches. The policies and procedures we have adopted that are designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations may not be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations. Our ability to originate loans could be restricted by recently adopted federal regulations. The CFPB has a rule intended to clarify how lenders can avoid legal liability under the Dodd-Frank Act, which holds lenders accountable for ensuring a borrower’s ability to repay a mortgage loan. Under the rule, loans that meet the “qualified mortgage” definition will be presumed to have complied with the ability-to-repay standard. Under the rule, a “qualified mortgage” loan must not contain certain specified features, including: • excessive upfront points and fees (those exceeding 3% of the total loan amount, less “bona fide discount points” for prime loans); • interest-only payments; • negative amortization; and • terms of longer than 30 years. Also, to qualify as a “qualified mortgage,” a loan must be made to a borrower whose total monthly debt-to-income ratio does not exceed 43%. Lenders must also verify and document the income and financial resources relied upon to qualify a borrower for the loan and underwrite the loan based on a fully amortizing payment schedule and maximum interest rate during the first five years, taking into account all applicable taxes, insurance and assessments. In addition, the CFPB has adopted rules and published forms that combine certain disclosures that consumers receive in connection with applying for and closing on certain mortgage loans under the Truth in Lending Act and the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act. We are subject to stringent capital requirements, which may adversely impact our return on equity, require us to raise additional capital, or limit our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares. The Bank’s minimum capital requirements are: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 6.0%; (iii) a total capital ratio of 8.0%; and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4.0%. The capital requirements also establish a “capital conservation buffer” of 2.5%, which results in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%; (ii) a Tier 1 to risk-based assets capital ratio of 8.5%; and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. An institution will be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. We have analyzed these capital requirements, and the Bank meets all of these requirements, including the 2.5% capital conservation buffer. 43 The application of more stringent capital requirements could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, and result in regulatory actions if we are unable to comply with such requirements. Furthermore, the imposition of liquidity requirements in connection with the implementation of the requirements of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“Basel III”) could result in our having to lengthen the term of our funding sources, change our business models or increase our holdings of liquid assets. Ponce Bank’s ability to pay dividends to the Company will be limited if it does not have the capital conservation buffer required by the capital rules, which may further limit the Company’s ability to pay dividends to stockholders. See “Regulation and Supervision—Federal Banking Regulation—Capital Requirements.” The Federal Reserve Board may require us to commit capital resources to support Ponce Bank. Federal law requires that a holding company act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support such subsidiary bank. Under the “source of strength” doctrine, the Federal Reserve Board may require a holding company to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the holding company with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices for failure to commit resources to a subsidiary bank. A capital injection may be required at times when the holding company may not have the resources to provide it and therefore may be required to borrow the funds or raise capital. Any loans by a holding company to its subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank. In the event of a holding company’s bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee will assume any commitment by the holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank. Moreover, bankruptcy law provides that claims based on any such commitment will be entitled to a priority of payment over the claims of the institution’s general unsecured creditors, including the holders of its note obligations. Thus, any borrowing that must be done by the Company to make a required capital injection becomes more difficult and expensive and could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition to being affected by general economic conditions, our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve Board. An important function of the Federal Reserve Board is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve Board to implement these objectives are open market purchases and sales of U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate and changes in banks’ reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits. The monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board have had a significant effect on the operating results of financial institutions in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The effects of such policies upon our business, financial condition and results of operations cannot be predicted. We are an emerging growth company, and any decision on our part to comply only with certain reduced reporting and disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies could make our common stock less attractive to investors. The Company is an emerging growth company. For as long as the Company continues to be an emerging growth company, it may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As an emerging growth company, the Company also will not be subject to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which would require that our independent auditors review and attest as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We have also elected to use the extended transition period to delay adoption of new or revised accounting pronouncements applicable to public companies until such pronouncements are made applicable to private companies. Accordingly, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of public companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards. The Company will cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earlier of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year of the Company during which it had total annual gross revenues of $1.07 billion (adjusted for inflation) or more; (ii) December 31, 2022, which is the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of the completion of PDL Community Bancorp’s initial stock offering in 2017; (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt; or (iv) the date on which the Company is deemed to be a “large accelerated filer” under SEC regulations (companies with a public float of at least $700 million of voting and non-voting equity held by non-affiliates). Investors may find our common stock less attractive since we have chosen to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and the price of our common stock may be more volatile. 44 Risk Related to our Operations. We face significant operational risks because the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions and increased reliance on technology, including risk of loss related to cyber security breaches. We operate in diverse markets and rely on the ability of our employees and systems to process a high number of transactions and to collect, process, transmit and store significant amounts of confidential information regarding our customers, employees and others and concerning our own business, operations, plans and strategies. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside our company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, systems failures or interruptions, breaches of our internal control systems and compliance requirements, and business continuation and disaster recovery. Insurance coverage may not be available for such losses, or where available, such losses may exceed insurance limits. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of operational deficiencies or as a result of non-compliance with applicable regulatory standards or customer attrition due to potential negative publicity. In addition, we outsource some of our data processing to certain third-party providers. If these third-party providers encounter difficulties, including as a result of cyber-attacks or information security breaches, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely affected. In the event of a breakdown in our internal control systems, improper operation of systems or improper employee actions, or a breach of our security systems, including if confidential or proprietary information were to be mishandled, misused or lost, we could suffer financial loss, face regulatory action, civil litigation and/or suffer damage to our reputation. Negative developments in the U.S. in our primary markets may adversely impact our results in the future. Our financial performance is highly dependent on the business environment in the markets where we operate and in the U.S. as a whole. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity, investor or business confidence, consumer sentiment, limitations on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital, increases in inflation or interest rates, natural disasters, international trade disputes and retaliatory tariffs, supply chain disruptions, terrorist attacks, global pandemics, acts of war, or a combination of these or other factors. Economic conditions in certain industries in the markets in which we operate deteriorated rapidly in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Inflation rose sharply at the end of 2021 and has continued rising in 2022 at levels not seen for over 40 years. Inflationary pressures are currently expected to remain elevated throughout 2022. A worsening of business and economic conditions, or persistent inflationary pressures or supply chain disruptions, generally or specifically in the principal markets in which we conduct business could have adverse effects, including the following: • a decrease in deposit balances or the demand for loans and other products and services we offer; • an increase in the number of borrowers who become delinquent, file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to us, which could lead to higher levels of nonperforming assets, net charge-offs and provisions for credit losses; • a decrease in the value of loans and other assets secured by real estate; and • a decrease in net interest income from our lending and deposit gathering activities. Although economic conditions have improved in most of our markets when compared to the first and second quarters of 2020 and we continue to focus on growing earning assets, we believe that it is possible we will continue to experience an uncertain and volatile economic environment during 2022, including as a result of issues of national security, international conflicts, COVID-19 and other health crises around the world, inflation and supply chain disruptions. There can be no assurance that these conditions will improve in the near term or that conditions will not worsen. Such conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The cost of finance and accounting systems, procedures and controls in order to satisfy our public company reporting requirements increases our expenses. The obligations of being a public company, including the substantial public reporting obligations, require significant expenditures and place additional demands on our management team. We have made, and will continue to make, changes to our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and accounting systems to meet our reporting obligations as a public company. However, the measures we take may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations as a public company. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Any failure to achieve and maintain an effective internal control environment could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price. In addition, we may need to hire additional compliance, accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical knowledge. As 45 a result, we may need to rely on outside consultants to provide these services for us until qualified personnel are hired. These obligations will increase our operating expenses and could divert our management’s attention from our operations . Risks Related to Accounting Matters Changes in accounting standards could affect reported earnings. The bodies responsible for establishing accounting standards, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the SEC and other regulatory bodies, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting guidance that governs the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply new or revised guidance retroactively. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “ Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” This ASU significantly changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. The Company has begun its evaluation of the amended guidance including the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements. As a result of the required change in approach toward determining estimated credit losses from the current “incurred loss” model to one based on estimated cash flows over a loan’s contractual life, adjusted for prepayments (a “life of loan” model), the Company expects that the new guidance will result in an increase in the allowance for loan losses, particularly for longer duration loan portfolios and this could have an adverse effect on our earnings. Changes in management’s estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements and our financial condition or operating results. Our management is and will be required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date to file periodic reports under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, including our consolidated financial statements. These estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known. Areas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include our evaluation of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses, the valuation of loans held for sale, the valuation of deferred tax assets and investment securities, the estimates relating to the valuation for share-based awards, and our determinations with respect to amounts owed for income taxes. Other Risks Related to Our Business and Industry Generally Ineffective liquidity management could adversely affect our financial results and condition. Effective liquidity management is essential for the operation of our business. We require sufficient liquidity to meet customer loan requests, customer deposit maturities/withdrawals, payments on our debt obligations as they come due and other cash commitments under both normal operating conditions and other unpredictable circumstances causing industry or general financial market stress. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy generally. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a downturn in the geographic markets in which our loans and operations are concentrated or difficult credit markets. Our access to deposits may also be affected by the liquidity needs of our depositors. In particular, a majority of our liabilities are checking accounts and other liquid deposits, which are payable on demand or upon several days’ notice, while by comparison, a substantial majority of our assets are loans, which cannot be called or sold in the same time frame. Although we have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances as necessary, we might not be able to replace such funds in the future, especially if a large number of our depositors seek to withdraw their accounts, regardless of the reason. A failure to maintain adequate liquidity could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition. Legal and regulatory proceedings and related matters could adversely affect us. We have been and may in the future become involved in legal and regulatory proceedings. We consider most of the proceedings to be in the normal course of our business or typical for the industry; however, it is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters, and we may not prevail in any proceedings or litigation. There could be substantial cost and management diversion in such litigation and proceedings, and any adverse determination could have a materially adverse effect on our business, brand or image, or our financial condition and results of our operations. We are a community bank and our ability to maintain our reputation is critical to the success of our business and the failure to do so may materially adversely affect our performance. The Bank is a community bank, and our reputation is one of the most valuable components of our business. A key component of our business strategy is to rely on our reputation for customer service and knowledge of local markets to expand our presence by 46 capturing new business opportunities from existing and prospective customers in our market area and contiguous areas. As such, we strive to conduct our business in a manner that enhances our reputation. This is done, in part, by recruiting, hiring and retaining employees who share our core values of being an integral part of the communities we serve, delivering superior service to our customers and caring about our customers and associates. If our reputation is negatively affected by the actions of our employees, by our inability to conduct our operations in a manner that is appealing to current or prospective customers, or otherwise, our business and, therefore, our operating results may be materially adversely affected. Our 2018 Equity Incentive Plan has increased our expenses and reduced our income, and may dilute your ownership interests. Stockholders previously approved the PDL Community Bancorp 2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized in each year $1.4 million in non-interest expense relating to this stock benefit plan, and we will recognize additional expenses in the future as additional grants are made and awards vest. The Company may fund the 2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan either through open market purchases or authorized but unissued shares of common stock. Our ability to repurchase shares of common stock to fund this plan will be subject to many factors, including, but not limited to, applicable regulatory restrictions on stock repurchases, the availability of stock in the market, the trading price of the stock, our capital levels, alternative uses for our capital and our financial performance. Stockholders would experience a reduction in ownership interest in the event newly issued shares of our common stock are used to fund stock issuances under the plan. New stock-based benefit plans will increase our expenses and reduce our income. The Company intends to adopt one or more new stock-based benefit plans, subject to stockholder approval, which will increase our annual compensation and benefit expenses related to the stock options and stock awards granted to participants under the stock-based benefit plan(s). The actual amount of these new stock-related compensation and benefit expenses will depend on the number of options and stock awards actually granted, the fair market value of our stock or options on the date of grant, the vesting period, and other factors which we cannot predict at this time. In the event we adopt a plan prior to January 27, 2023, the total shares of common stock reserved for issuance pursuant to awards of restricted stock and grants of options under our proposed stock-based benefit plans would be limited to 4% and 10%, respectively, of the total shares of our common stock sold in the offering and contributed to the Foundation on January 27, 2022. If we award restricted shares of common stock or grant options in excess of these amounts under stock-based benefit plans adopted after January 27, 2023, our costs would increase further. We intend to adopt a stock-based benefit plan that would reserve for the exercise of stock options and the grant of stock awards a number of shares equal to 10.0% and 4.0%, respectively, of the shares sold in the offering and contributed to the Foundation on January 27, 2022. In addition, the Company will recognize expense for our employee stock ownership plan when shares are committed to be released to participants’ accounts, and we will recognize expense for restricted stock awards and stock options over the vesting period of awards made to recipients. The expense in the first year following January 27, 2022 for shares purchased in the offering has been estimated to be approximately $2.9 million ($2.3 million after tax). Actual expenses, however, may be higher or lower, depending on the price of our common stock. The implementation of stock-based benefit plans may dilute your ownership interest. Historically, stockholders have approved these stock-based benefit plans. The Company intends to adopt one or more new stock-based benefit plans. These plans may be funded either through open market purchases or from the issuance of authorized but unissued shares of common stock. Our ability to repurchase shares of common stock to fund these plans will be subject to many factors, including applicable regulatory restrictions on stock repurchases, the availability of stock in the market, the trading price of the stock, our capital levels, alternative uses for our capital and our financial performance. Stockholders would experience a 7.0% dilution in ownership interest in the event newly issued shares of our common stock are used to fund stock options and shares of restricted stock in amounts equal to 10.0% and 4.0%, respectively, of the shares sold in the offering and contributed to the Foundation on January 27, 2022. If adopted prior to January 27, 2023, the number of shares reserved for the exercise of stock options or available for stock awards under the stock-based benefit plan is expected to be limited to 10% and 4%, respectively, of the shares sold in the offering and contributed to the Foundation on January 27, 2022. In the event we adopt a plan later than January 27, 2023, the plan would not be subject to these limitations and stockholders could experience greater dilution. Although the implementation of the stock-based benefit plan will be subject to stockholder approval, historically, the overwhelming majority of stock-based benefit plans adopted by savings institutions and their holding companies following mutual-to-stock conversions have been approved by stockholders. 47 Societal responses to climate change could adversely affect our business and performance, including indirectly through impacts on our customers. Concerns over the long-term impacts of climate change have led and will continue to lead to governmental efforts around the world to mitigate those impacts. Consumers and businesses also may change their behavior on their own as a result of these concerns. We and our customers will need to respond to new laws and regulations as well as consumer and business preferences resulting from climate change concerns. We and our customers may face cost increases, asset value reductions and operating process changes. The impact on our customers will likely vary depending on their specific attributes, including reliance on or role in carbon intensive activities. Among the impacts to us could be a drop in demand for our products and services, particularly in certain sectors. In addition, we could face reductions in creditworthiness on the part of some customers or in the value of assets securing loans. Our efforts to take these risks into account in making lending and other decisions, including by increasing our business with climate-friendly companies, may not be effective in protecting us from the negative impact of new laws and regulations or changes in consumer or business behavior. Our historical markets, minority and immigrant individuals, may be threatened by gentrification and adverse political developments, which could decrease our growth and profitability. We believe that our historical strength has been our focus on the minority and immigrant markets. The continuing displacement of minorities due to gentrification of our communities may adversely affect us unless we are able to adapt and increase the acceptance of our products and services by non-minority customers. We may also be unfavorably impacted by political developments unfavorable to markets that are dependent on immigrant populations. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. Not applicable. Item 2.

Periodically, there have been various claims and lawsuits against us, such as claims to enforce liens, condemnation proceedings on properties in which we hold security interests, claims involving the making and servicing of real property loans and other issues incident to our business. We are not a party to any pending legal proceedings that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. Not applicable. 50 PART II Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities. The Company’s shares of common stock are traded on the NASDAQ Stock Market, LLC under the symbol “PDLB”. The number of stockholders of record of the Company’s common stock as of March 28, 2022 was 450. The number of record-holders may not reflect the number of persons or entities holding stock in nominee name through banks, brokerage firms and other nominees. To date, the Company (or its predecessor PDL Community Bancorp) has not paid any dividends to its stockholders. We have no current plan or intention to pay cash dividends to our stockholders. However, if in the future the Board of Directors considers the payment of dividends, the amount of any dividend payments will be subject to statutory and regulatory limitations, and will depend upon a number of factors, including the following: regulatory capital requirements; our financial condition and results of operations; our other uses of funds for the long-term value of stockholders; tax considerations; and general economic conditions. No assurance can be given that the Board of Directors will ever consider the payment of dividends, and shareholders should have no expectation of such. The Federal Reserve Board has issued a policy statement providing that dividends should be paid only out of current earnings and only if our prospective rate of earnings retention is consistent with our capital needs, asset quality and overall financial condition. Regulatory guidance also provides for prior regulatory consultation with respect to capital distributions in certain circumstances such as where the holding company’s net income for the past four quarters, net of dividends previously paid over that period, is insufficient to fully fund the dividend or the holding company’s overall rate of earnings retention is inconsistent with its capital needs and overall financial condition. In addition, the Company’s ability to pay dividends will be limited if it does not have the capital conservation buffer required by the capital rules, which may limit our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders. See “Regulation and Supervision—Federal Bank Regulation—Capital Requirements.” No assurances can be given that any dividends will be paid or that, if paid, will not be reduced or eliminated in the future. We will file a consolidated federal tax return. Accordingly, it is anticipated that any cash distributions that we make to our stockholders would be treated as cash dividends and not as a non-taxable return of capital for federal and state tax purposes. Pursuant to our charter, we are authorized to issue preferred stock. If we issue preferred stock, the holders thereof may have a priority over the holders of our shares of common stock with respect to the payment of dividends. For a further discussion concerning the payment of dividends on our shares of common stock, see “Regulation and Supervision—Holding Company Regulations—Dividends and Stock Repurchases.” Dividends we can declare and pay will depend, in part, upon receipt of dividends from Ponce Bank, because currently we will have no source of income other than dividends from Ponce Bank and earnings from the investment of funds held by the Company and interest payments received in connection with the loan to the employee stock ownership plan. Regulations of the Federal Reserve Board and the OCC impose limitations on “capital distributions” by savings institutions. See “Regulation and Supervision—Federal Bank Regulation—Capital Requirements.” Any payment of dividends by Ponce Bank to the Company that would be deemed to be drawn out of Ponce Bank’s bad debt reserves, if any, would require a payment of taxes at the then-current tax rate by Ponce Bank on the amount of earnings deemed to be removed from the reserves for such distribution. Ponce Bank does not intend to make any distribution to the Company that would create such a federal tax liability. See “Taxation.” Recent Sales of Unregistered Securities; Use of Proceeds from Registered Securities There were no sales of registered securities during the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company has made no sales of unregistered securities. Item 6. Reserved . 51 Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following management’s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those described below. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those identified below and those described in Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors,” within this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Overview On January 27, 2022, Ponce Financial Group, Inc. and PDL Community Bancorp announced that the conversion and reorganization of Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company from the mutual to stock form of organization and related stock offering was consummated at the close of business. As a result of the closing of the conversion and reorganization and stock offering, Ponce Financial Group, Inc. is now the holding company for Ponce Bank. Ponce Bank’s former mutual holding companies, PDL Community Bancorp and Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company, have ceased to exist. See Note 20, “Subsequent Events - Plan of Conversion and Reorganization,” to the accompanying Financial Statements for a discussion of the related transactions. We have made significant investments over the last several years in adding experienced bankers, expanding our lending and relationship staff, absorbing the costs of being a public company, upgrading technology and facilities and acquiring Mortgage World. These investments have increased our operating expenses during those periods. However, during those same periods, we have been able to significantly grow the Bank’s loan portfolio while maintaining a moderate risk profile and strengthening its capital. Abrupt changes in interest rates will present us with a challenge in managing our interest rate risk. As a general matter, our interest-bearing liabilities reprice or mature more quickly than our interest-earning assets, which can result in interest expense increasing more rapidly than increases in interest income as interest rates increase and lowering our interest expense faster than lowering our interest income as interest rates decrease. Therefore, increases in interest rates may adversely affect our net interest income and net economic value, which in turn would likely have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Conversely, decreases in interest rates may have a favorable effect on our net interest income and net economic value, which in turn would likely have a positive effect on our results of operations. As described in “—Management of Market Risk,” we expect that our net interest income and our net economic value would react inversely to instantaneous changes in interest rates. To help manage interest rate risk, we promote core deposit products and we are diversifying our loan portfolio by introducing new lending programs. See “—Business Strategy”, “—Management of Market Risk” and “Risk Factors—Future changes in interest rates could reduce our profits and asset values.” Non-GAAP Financial Measures The following discussion contains certain non-GAAP financial measures in addition to results presented in accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP measures are intended to provide the reader with additional supplemental perspectives on operating results, performance trends, and financial condition. Non-GAAP financial measures are not a substitute for GAAP measures; they should be read and used in conjunction with the Company’s GAAP financial information. The Company’s non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similar non-GAAP information which may be presented by other companies. In all cases, it should be understood that non-GAAP operating measures do not depict amounts that accrue directly to the benefit of shareholders. An item that management excludes when computing non-GAAP adjusted earnings can be of substantial importance to the Company’s results and condition for any particular year. A reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP measures is provided below. The SEC has exempted from the definition of non-GAAP financial measures certain commonly used financial measures that are not based on GAAP. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful in evaluating the Company’s financial performance and facilitate comparisons with the performance of other financial institutions. However, the information should be considered supplemental in nature and not as a substitute for related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. The table below includes references to the Company's net income and earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 before gain on sale of real property. In management's view, that information, which is considered non-GAAP information, may be useful to investors as it will improve an understanding of core operations for the current and future periods. The non-GAAP net income amount and earnings per share reflect adjustments of the non-recurring gain on sale of real property, net of tax effect. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP information to GAAP net income and earnings per share is provided below. 52 Non-GAAP Reconciliation – Net Income B efore Gain on S ale of Real Property (Unaudited) Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020 (Dollars in thousands, except per share data) Net income - GAAP $ 25,415 $ 3,853 Gain on sale of real property (20,270 ) (4,177 ) Income tax benefit 4,257 877 Net income - non-GAAP $ 9,402 $ 553 Earnings per common share (GAAP) (1) $ 1.52 $ 0.23 Earnings per common share (non-GAAP) (1) $ 0.56 $ 0.03 (1) Earnings per share were computed (for the GAAP and non-GAAP basis) based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, 16,744,561 shares and 16,673,193 shares, respectively. The assumed exercise of outstanding stock options and vesting of restricted stock units were included in computing the non-GAAP earnings per share and do not result in material dilution . COVID-19 Pandemic and the CARES Act On March 27, 2020, Congress passed, and the President signed, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) to address the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The CARES Act appropriated $349.0 billion for PPP loans and on April 24, 2020, the SBA received another $310.0 billion in PPP funding. On December 27, 2020, the Economic Aid Act appropriated $284.0 billion for both first and second draw PPP loans, bringing the total appropriations for PPP loans to $943.0 billion. The PPP ended on May 31, 2021. Loans under the PPP that meet SBA requirements may be forgiven in certain circumstances, and are 100% guaranteed by the SBA. The Company had received SBA approval and originated 5,340 PPP loans, of which 1,606 loans totaling $136.8 million were outstanding at December 31, 2021. PPP loans have a two-year or five-year term, provide for fees of up to 5% of the loan amount and earn interest at a rate of 1% per annum. It is our expectation that a significant portion of these loans will ultimately be forgiven by the SBA in accordance with the terms of the program. The average authorized loan size is $85,000 and the median authorized loan size is $15,000. The Bank, which is designated as both a CDFI and a MDI, originated 5,340 PPP loans in the amount of $261.4 million, which, based upon information provided by the SBA, significantly exceeded the reported average performance of banks in our peer group. As a result of the initial COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, the Company continues to alter the way it has historically provided services to its deposit customers while seeking to maintain normal day-to-day back-office operations and lending functions. To that end, as of December 31, 2021, all back-office and lending personnel were formed into teams which alternate between a remote and in office work environment while the branch network continues to provide traditional banking services to its communities and has for the most part returned to normal operating hours while continuing to shift service delivery to electronic and web-based products. The Company continues its extensive and intensive communications program geared to informing customers of the alternative resources provided by the Company for retaining access to financial services, closing loans and conducting banking transactions, such as ATM networks, online banking, mobile applications, remote deposits and the Company’s Contact Center. The Company proactively manages its day-to-day operations by using video and telephonic conferencing. The Company remains vigilant of the potential for other COVID-19 variant outbreaks and remains prepared to restore the necessary protocols to minimize any disruptions to its current operations and services. As of December 31, 2021, four loans in the amount of $8.0 million remained in forbearance as a result of renewed forbearance. Of the four loans receiving renewed forbearance, one loan in the amount of $6.6 million is related to construction real estate, two loans, totaling $1.0 million are related to one-to-four family residential real estate and one loan in the amount of $391,000 is related to non-residential properties. All of these loans had been performing in accordance with their contractual obligations prior to the granting of the initial forbearance. Federal Economic Relief Funds To Aid Lending to Small Businesses On August 10, 2021, the Company through its subsidiary, the Bank, received from the United States Department of the Treasury a grant in the amount of $1.8 million in federal Economic Relief Funds for Small Businesses. Critical Accounting Policies Accounting estimates are necessary in the application of certain accounting policies and procedures and are particularly susceptible to significant change. Critical accounting policies are defined as those involving significant judgments and assumptions by management and that could have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets, liabilities or on income under different assumptions or conditions. Management believes that the most critical accounting policy relates to the allowance for loan losses. 53 The allowance for loan losses is established as probable incurred losses are estimated to have occurred through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on the Company’s consolidated financial statements, which are prepared in conformity with GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported amounts of income and expenses. The estimates and assumptions used are based on historical experience and various other factors and are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions, resulting in a change that could have a material impact on the carrying value of our assets and liabilities and our results of operations. See Note 1, “Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to the accompanying Financial Statements for a discussion of significant accounting policies. Factors Affecting the Comparability of Results Purchase of Real Property. On January 22, 2021, the Bank completed the purchase of property located at 135-12/14 Northern Boulevard, Flushing, New York through a qualified intermediary in an IRS Code 1031 like-kind exchange related to the previously disclosed sale of real property on July 27, 2020 that was owned by the Bank. The purchase price of the property was $3.6 million. Sale of Real Properties. O n February 11, 2021, the Company completed the sale of real property located at 3821 Bergenline Avenue, Union City, New Jersey for a sale price of $2.4 million. Concurrent with the sale, the Bank and the purchaser entered into a fifteen-year lease agreement whereby the Bank will lease back this real property at an initial annual base rent of approximately $145,000 subject to annual rent increases of 1.5%. Under the lease agreement, the Bank has four (4) consecutive options to extend the term of the lease by five (5) years for each such option. The sale lease-back resulted in a gain of approximately $623,000, net of expenses, which is included in other non-interest income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations . On June 4, 2021, the Company completed the sale of real property located at 5560 Broadway, Bronx, New York for a sale price of $5.7 million. Concurrent with the sale, the Bank and the purchaser entered into a fifteen-year lease agreement whereby the Bank will lease back this real property at an initial annual base rent of approximately $281,000 subject to annual rent increases of 1.75%. The sale lease-back resulted in a gain of approximately $4.2 million, net of expenses, which is included in other non-interest income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. On November 10, 2021, the Company completed the sale of real property located at 2244 Westchester Avenue, Bronx, New York for a sale price of $16.1 million. Concurrent with the sale, the Bank and the purchaser entered into a seventeen-year lease agreement whereby the Bank will lease back this real property at an initial annual base rent of approximately $926,000, subject to annual rent increases of 1.75%. The sale lease-back resulted in a gain of approximately $8.7 million, net of expenses, which is included in other non-interest income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. O n November 12, 2021 , the Company completed the sale of real property located at 169-174 Smith Street, Brooklyn , New York for a sale price of $4.0 million. Concurrent with the sale, the Bank and the purchaser entered into a fifteen-year lease agreement whereby the Bank will lease back this real property at an initial annual base rent of approximately $200,000 subject to annual rent increases of 1.50%. The sale lease-back resulted in a gain of approximately $3.7 million, net of expenses, which is included in other non-interest income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. On December 16, 2021, the Company completed the sale of real property located at 37-60 82 nd Street, Jackson Heights, New York for a sale price of $11.8 million. Concurrent with the sale, the Bank and the purchaser entered into a seventeen-year lease agreement whereby the Bank will lease back this real property at an initial annual base rent of approximately $530,000 subject to annual rent increases of 2.0%. The sale lease-back resulted in a gain of approximately $3.1 million, net of expenses, which is included in other non-interest income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Vision 2025 Evolves The Company is now in the later stages of its multi-pronged effort to upgrade its infrastructure, adopt electronic banking services and restructure its retail business model. Dubbed internally “Vision 2020,” the effort has resulted in significant beneficial results, continues to involve significant investments and has served to ameliorate the otherwise detrimental effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of Vision 2020, the Company partnered with Salesforce to deploy applications throughout the organization, including retail services, lending processes, back-office operations, digital banking and loan underwriting. Although the full implementation of 54 the applications, dubbed internally as “GPS, a Guided Path to Success,” was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it was fully implemented by the end 2021. The infrastructure upgrade has focused primarily on implementing technology, cybersecurity and network progression while establishing a Virtual Private Network (“VPN”). To date the infrastructure upgrade has resulted in relocating and migrating network and in-house servers, replacing outdated PCs, enhancing internet capabilities, purchasing and deploying VPN-enabled laptops to a significant majority of the Bank’s personnel and the redeployment of disaster recovery capabilities. The Company has achieved certain manpower-related cost savings and enabled the uninterrupted continuity of operations by its staff working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic using its newly deployed disaster recovery capabilities. The infrastructure upgrade has added resiliency, capacity and redundancies to the Company’s technology structures and enhances the capability of the Company to increase its flexibility with alternate locations of personnel. The Company has adopted and deployed over 48 new electronic banking services, products and applications since late 2018. These services range from on-line banking, mobile banking, bill pay, positive pay, remote deposit capture, cash management services, e-statements, data storage and management, ACH services, electronic document storage, a paperless environment, dual-language telephone banking service and VoIP telecommunications with an automation-based, dual-language Customer Contact Center. These services have not only enabled the Company to continue serving its customers as they, and the Company, converted to a remote work environment; the services have served to increase the product penetration and deepening relationships with customers. The Company has also added to its social media capabilities and has begun to use them in coordination with new targeted marketing campaigns now enabled by GPS and its Marketing Cloud platform. The combination of social media and targeted marketing campaigns has been particularly effective with PPP loan originations using many partnerships established with non-profit groups and community-based organizations. Such efforts enabled the Company to more than triple the number of second round PPP loan applications compared to the first round, and has resulted in significant growth in retail deposits and new relationships. In 2020, the Company rolled out its first Fintech-based product in partnership with the startup company Grain. Grain’s product is a mobile application geared to the underbanked and new generations entering the financial services market that utilizes non-traditional underwriting methodologies. Under the terms of its agreement with Grain, the Bank is the lender and depository for Grain-originated microloans and, where applicable, security deposits, to consumers, with credit lines currently up to $1,000. Grain originates and services the loans and is responsible for maintaining compliance with the Bank’s origination and servicing standards. To the extent such standards are not maintained, Grain is responsible for any related losses. The Company, pursuant to its partnership with Grain, has 59,180 consumer loans with outstanding balances totaling $33.9 million at December 31, 2021. The Company is seeking to provide additional digital banking services to these customers and to extend Grain to its retail facilities. The Company has invested $1.0 million directly in Grain and is integrating Grain and GPS. As a result of Grain’s on going nonconformance with the Bank’s origination and servicing standards, the Bank has had Grain purchase consumer loans totaling $13.0 million, of which $10.4 million of this amount had not been received by the Company and is a receivable of the Bank as of December 31, 2021. The Bank has been provided assurance from Grain and its investors that the $10.4 million receivable will be satisfied by December 31, 2022, subject to Grain's successful efforts in acquiring significant funding through a private securities offering or other sources. The Company continues to closely monitor its portfolio of consumer loans originated by Grain as well as Grain’s refinement of solutions for detecting and preventing cyber fraud in the application for loans. The Company also evaluates on a monthly basis Grain’s progress regarding its capital raising efforts and the likelihood that it will be able to pay the outstanding receivable from Grain that resulted from loans originated on behalf of the Bank that have failed to meet the Bank’s underwriting standards, as well as the ongoing credit quality of the portfolio of Grain consumer loans. If, as a result of the continuing evaluation, the Company determines that Grain is unlikely to achieve acceptable refinements or additional Grain loans are found to be not in conformance with the Bank’s origination and servicing standards, the Bank may be required to increase its allowance for loan losses, increase its loan reserves or charge off the value of such loans. Further, if the Company determines that Grain is unlikely to raise needed capital in an acceptable time frame or otherwise be unable to pay the outstanding amount it owes the Bank, the Bank may be required to write down the value of this receivable. As a consequence of such events the Bank may terminate its lending relationship with Grain and the value of the Company’s equity investment in Grain could become impaired. The Company is also in the final stages of deploying a Fintech-based small business automated lending technology in partnership with LendingFront Technologies, Inc. The technology is a mobile application that digitizes the lending workflow from pre-approval to servicing and enables the Company to originate, close and fund small business loans within very short spans of time, without requiring a physical presence within banking offices and with automated underwriting using both traditional and non-traditional methods. The application has full loan origination and servicing capabilities and is integrated with Salesforce. All Commercial Relationship Officers and Business Development Managers will utilize these capabilities upon the easing of the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company is seeking to establish loan origination partnerships with non-profit and community-based organizations to ensure penetration in underserved and underbanked markets. The Company also established a relationship with SaveBetter, LLC, a fintech startup focusing on brokered deposits. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had $53.6 million in such deposits. The recent regulatory easing of brokered deposit rules may enable the Company to classify such deposits as core deposits. 55 The Company’s on-going adoption of a new retail business model has been all-encompassing. It has involved the redesign of its retail branches, the shift of branch operations to a centralized back office, the deployment of smart ITM-enabled ATMs and Teller Cash Recyclers, the automation of manual processes and, importantly, the adoption of universal bankers and retail sales. In 2019, the Company earned national recognition as Branch Innovators of the Year for its retail banking model at the 2019 Future Branches Retail Banking Summit in Austin, Texas. The Company has renovated most of its branches at costs significantly less than previous efforts largely as a result of economies of scale, design modifications and adoption of buildout techniques used by non-bank retail organizations. The Bank’s Riverdale branch was transformed into a new flagship recapturing previously subleased space. This $1.5 million construction project commenced on March 1, 2021 and was completed on time and on budget. Our grand re-opening took place on July 27, 2021 and was attended by the Bronx Borough President who praised Ponce Bank for remaining committed to the Bronx and for a long history of leadership within the community. Our Astoria branch renovation project was also completed in the second quarter of 2021. Renovation was put on hold for the Smith Street, Brooklyn, Union City, NJ, and Southern Boulevard, Bronx, banking branches. Bidding for these three locations has been delayed pending the completion of surveys at our Forest Hills, Jackson Heights, Stuyvesant Town and Southern Blvd branches. The Company has begun incorporating into its retail branches loan origination personnel including a branded Ponce Mortgage Center celebrating our comprehensive offerings made possible by our affiliated company Ponce De Leon Mortgage Corporation. The Company also anticipates creating a full-service branch at its mortgage office located in Flushing, Queens, New York and banking satellite at its office in Bergenfield, New Jersey. The Company’s office located in Flushing, Queens, expanded the Company’s reach into one of the most underserved areas of Queens according to recently reported PPP loan penetration data. Vision 2020 already has had a transformational effect on the Company. The Company had approximately $1.06 billion in assets, $918.5 million in loans and $809.8 million in deposits, at December 31, 2018, and $2.7 million net income and $0.15 in earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2018. The Company has since grown to $1.65 billion in assets, $1.31 billion in loans receivables, net of allowance for loan losses of $16.4 million, and $1.20 billion in deposits at December 31, 2021, and $25.4 million in net income, $1.52 in basic earnings per share and $1.51 in diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2021, all while investing in infrastructure, implementing digital banking, acquiring Mortgage World, adopting GPS, diversifying its product offering, meeting the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, partnering with Fintech companies and assisting its communities with 5,340 PPP loans totaling $261.4 million. The Company raised over $132.0 million in additional capital through our conversion and reorganization and realized approximately $20.0 million in net gain while freeing up approximately $40.0 million in investable funds through our sale-and-leaseback initiative. Now, the Company believes that it is poised to enhance its presence, locally and in similar communities outside New York, as a leading CDFI and MDI financial holding company. On December 14, 2021, the U.S. Department of the Treasury (“Treasury”) notified the Company that it is eligible to receive an amount up to $186.5 million under the Emergency Capital Investment Program (“ECIP”). Under the ECIP, Treasury will provide investment capital directly to depository institutions that are CDFIs or MDIs, such as the Bank or their holding companies such as the Company, to provide loans, grants, and forbearance for small businesses, minority-owned businesses, and consumers, in low-income and underserved communities. If made, Treasury’s investment would be in exchange for the Company issuing senior perpetual noncumulative preferred stock directly to Treasury on terms established by the Treasury. Treasury has indicated that the investment will qualify as Tier 1 capital . No dividends will accrue or be due for the first two years after issuance. For years three through ten, depending upon the level of qualified and/or deep impact lending made in targeted communities, as defined in the ECIP guidelines, dividends will be at an annual rate of either 2.0%, 1.25% or 0.5% and, thereafter, will be fixed at one of the foregoing rates. The preferred stock will provide for customary preferences, including provisions upon nonpayment of dividends and board seats in such an event as well as customary protective provisions. The Company is evaluating the proposed standard terms of the investment provided by the Treasury, as well as other considerations. We cannot provide any assurance or guarantee concerning what the actual terms, conditions and preferences of the senior preferred stock will be or whether they will be acceptable. The Company is cementing Vision 2025, its roadmap to acquiring the resources needed to lead efforts to remediate the disparate effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the wealth and financial gaps present in its communities and similar communities outside the New York City metropolitan area. The Company traces its roots to its organization in 1960 as Ponce De Leon Federal Savings and Loan Association by Latino leaders concerned that the Bronx and its Latino population were not being recognized. True to its roots, the Company remains committed to ensuring that the disparate effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the wealth and financial gaps present in minority communities are addressed in earnest. 56 The following table presents the Company’s PPP loans outstanding as of December 31, 2021 : Aggregate Median Average Number Amount Amount Amount State Counties of Loans of Loans of Loans of Loans (Dollars in thousands) New York Albany 2 $ 125 $ 63 $ 63 Bronx 362 23,564 13 65 Dutchess 4 96 21 24 Greene 1 20 20 20 Kings 229 46,656 17 204 Nassau 93 4,904 14 53 New York 243 38,041 17 157 Orange 4 39 10 10 Putnam 1 13 13 13 Queens 443 16,441 16 37 Richmond 15 511 17 34 Rockland 8 231 20 29 Schenectady 1 21 21 21 Suffolk 32 542 13 17 Ulster 1 19 19 19 Westchester 40 829 14 21 Total New York 1,479 $ 132,052 $ 15 $ 89 New Jersey Atlantic 3 $ 20 $ 7 $ 7 Bergen 25 1,134 20 45 Burlington 1 20 20 20 Camden 1 21 21 21 Essex 25 265 11 11 Hudson 29 1,648 19 57 Mercer 2 52 26 26 Monmouth 6 659 24 110 Morris 1 28 28 28 Ocean 3 24 6 8 Passaic 14 542 10 39 Somerset 1 10 10 10 Sussex 1 12 12 12 Union 4 36 10 9 Total New Jersey 116 $ 4,471 $ 15 $ 39 California Los Angeles 1 $ 10 $ 10 $ 10 San Diego 1 21 21 21 Total California 2 $ 31 $ 15 $ 16 Connecticut Fairfield 2 $ 16 $ 8 $ 8 New Haven 1 9 9 9 Total Connecticut 3 $ 25 $ 9 $ 8 Arizona Pima 1 $ 21 $ 21 $ 21 Delaware New Castle 1 135 135 135 Florida Orange 1 2 2 2 Indiana Lake 2 18 9 9 Pennsylvania Berks 1 16 16 16 Total 1,606 $ 136,771 $ 15 $ 85 57 Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 Total Assets . Total consolidated assets increased $298.3 million, or 22.0%, to $1.65 billion at December 31, 2021 from $1.36 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase in total assets is attributable to increases in net loans receivable of $146.4 million, including $51.5 million in PPP loans, available-for-sale securities of $95.8 million, cash and cash equivalents of $81.8 million, other assets of $7.5 million and accrued interest receivable of $966,000. The increase in total assets was reduced by decreases in mortgage loans held for sale, at fair value, of $19.6 million, premises and equipment, net, of $12.4 million, deferred tax assets of $836,000, held-to-maturity securities of $809,000, FHLBNY stock of $425,000 and placements with banks of $249,000. Cash and Cash Equivalents . Cash and cash equivalents increased $81.8 million, or 113.5%, to $153.9 million at December 31, 2021, compared to $72.1 million at December 31, 2020. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was attributable to an increase in net deposits, liabilities related to the deposit of funds for subsciptions for the Company’s common stock in connection with its’s second-step conversion, proceeds from the sale of real properties, proceeds from the sale of loans, net proceeds from the sale and purchase of shares for treasury stock and proceeds from the sale and maturities of available-for-sale securities. The increase in cash and cash equivalents was offset by an increase of loan funding and originations, purchases of available-for-sale securities, a decrease in advances of warehouse lines of credit, repayment of advances from the FHLBNY and purchases of premises and equipment. Securities . The composition of securities at December 31, 2021 and 2020 and the amounts maturing of each classification are summarized as follows: December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Amortized Fair Amortized Fair Cost Value Cost Value (in thousands) Available-for-Sale Securities: U.S. Government Bonds: Amounts maturing: Three months or less $ — $ — $ — $ — More than three months through one year — — — — More than one year through five years 2,981 2,934 — — More than five years through ten years — — — — 2,981 2,934 — — Corporate Bonds: Amounts maturing: Three months or less — — — — More than three months through one year — — — — More than one year through five years 4,445 4,381 2,651 2,728 More than five years through ten years 16,797 16,803 7,730 7,735 21,242 21,184 10,381 10,463 Mortgage-Backed Securities 90,950 89,228 6,970 7,035 Total available-for-sale securities $ 115,173 $ 113,346 $ 17,351 $ 17,498 Held-to-Maturity Securities: Mortgage-Backed Securities $ 934 $ 914 $ 1,743 $ 1,722 Total held-to-maturity securities $ 934 $ 914 $ 1,743 $ 1,722 The $95.8 million increase in available-for-sale securities was due to $109.9 million in available-for-sale securities that were purchased during the year ended December 31, 2021. The increase was offset primarily by $3.6 million in available-for-sale security sold, $5.7 million in principal payments, $2.7 million securities matured and/or were called and $2.0 million in unrealized loss during the year ended December 31, 2021. 58 Gross Loans Receivable . The composition of gross loans receivable at December 31, 2021 and 2020 and the percentage of each classification to total loans are summarized as follows: December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Increase (Decrease) Amount Percent of Total Amount Percent of Total Dollars Percent (Dollars in thousands) Mortgage loans: 1-4 Family residential Investor-Owned $ 317,304 24.0 % $ 319,596 27.3 % $ (2,292 ) (0.7 %) Owner-Occupied 96,947 7.3 % 98,795 8.4 % (1,848 ) (1.9 %) Multifamily residential 348,300 26.3 % 307,411 26.2 % 40,889 13.3 % Nonresidential properties 239,691 18.1 % 218,929 18.7 % 20,762 9.5 % Construction and land 134,651 10.2 % 105,858 9.0 % 28,793 27.2 % Total mortgage loans 1,136,893 86.0 % 1,050,589 89.6 % 86,304 8.2 % Nonmortgage loans: Business loans (1) 150,512 11.4 % 94,947 8.1 % 55,565 58.5 % Consumer loans (2) 34,693 2.6 % 26,517 2.3 % 8,176 30.8 % Total nonmortgage loans 185,205 14.0 % 121,464 10.4 % 63,741 52.5 % Total gross loans $ 1,322,098 100.0 % $ 1,172,053 100.0 % $ 150,045 12.8 % (1) As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, business loans include $136.8 million and $85.3 million, respectively, of PPP loans. (2) As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, consumer loans include $33.9 million and $25.5 million, respectively, of loans originated by the Bank pursuant to its arrangement with Grain. The increase in the composition of the loan portfolio was aided by an increase of $51.5 million related to PPP loans at December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020. Based on current internal loan reviews, the Company believes that the quality of our underwriting, our weighted average loan-to-value ratio of 57.0% and our customer selection processes have served us well and provided us with a reliable base with which to maintain a well-protected loan portfolio. Commercial real estate mortgage loans, as defined by applicable banking regulations, include multifamily residential, nonresidential properties, and construction and land mortgage loans. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, approximately 7.9% of the outstanding principal balance of the Bank’s commercial real estate mortgage loans was secured by owner-occupied commercial real estate. Owner-occupied commercial real estate is similar in many ways to commercial and industrial lending in that these loans are generally made to businesses predominantly on the basis of the cash flows of the business rather than on cash flows and valuation of the real estate. Banking regulations have established guidelines relating to the amount of construction and land mortgage loans and investor-owned commercial real estate mortgage loans of 100% and 300% of total risk-based capital, respectively. Should a bank’s ratios be in excess of these guidelines, banking regulations generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by the bank’s management. The Bank’s policy is to operate within the 100% guideline for construction and land mortgage loans and up to 400% for investor-owned commercial real estate mortgage loans. Both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by the Bank’s total risk-based capital. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Bank’s construction and land mortgage loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital was 79.6% and 68.3%, respectively. Investor-owned commercial real estate mortgage loans as a percentage of total risk-based capital was 396.2% and 379.8% as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. At December 31, 2021, the Bank was within the 100% ratio for construction and land mortgage loans established by banking guidelines, but exceeded the 300% guideline for investor-owned commercial real estate mortgage loans. However, the Bank was within its 400% policy limit established by the Bank’s internal loan policy. Management believes that it has established the appropriate level of controls to monitor the Bank’s lending in these areas. Mortgage Loans Held For Sale . Mortgage loans held for sale, at fair value, at December 31, 2021 decreased $19.6 million to $15.8 million from $ 35.4 million at December 31, 2020. 59 Deposits . The composition of deposits at December 31, 2021 and 2020 and changes in dollars and percentages are summarized as follows: December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 Increase (Decrease) Percent Percent Amount of Total Amount of Total Dollars Percent (Dollars in thousands) Demand (1) $ 274,956 22.7 % $ 189,855 18.5 % $ 85,101 44.8 % Interest-bearing deposits: NOW/IOLA accounts 35,280 2.9 % 39,296 3.8 % (4,016 ) (10.2 %) Money market accounts 186,893 15.5 % 136,258 13.2 % 50,635 37.2 % Reciprocal deposits 143,221 11.9 % 131,363 12.8 % 11,858 9.0 % Savings accounts 134,887 11.2 % 125,820 12.2 % 9,067 7.2 % Total NOW, money market, reciprocal and savings 500,281 41.5 % 432,737 42.0 % 67,544 15.6 % Certificates of deposit of $250K or more 78,454 6.5 % 78,435 7.6 % 19 0.0 % Brokered certificates of deposit (2) 79,320 6.6 % 52,678 5.1 % 26,642 50.6 % Listing service deposits (2) 66,411 5.5 % 39,476 3.8 % 26,935 68.2 % All other certificates of deposit less than $250K 205,294 17.0 % 236,398 23.0 % (31,104 ) (13.2 %) Total certificates of deposit 429,479 35.7 % 406,987 39.5 % 22,492 5.5 % Total interest-bearing deposits 929,760 77.2 % 839,724 81.5 % 90,036 10.7 % Total deposits $ 1,204,716 100.0 % $ 1,029,579 100.0 % $ 175,137 17.0 % (1) As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, included in demand deposits are deposits related to net PPP funding. (2) As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were $29.0 million and 27.0 million, respectively, in individual listing service deposits amounting to $250,000 or more. All brokered certificates of deposit individually amounted to less than $250,000. When wholesale funding is necessary to complement the Company's core deposit base, management determines which source is best suited to address both liquidity risk and interest rate risk in line with management objectives. The Company’s Interest Rate Risk Policy imposes limitations on overall wholesale funding and noncore funding reliance. The overall reliance on wholesale funding and noncore funding were within those policy limitations as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. The Management Asset/Liability Committee generally meets on a bi-weekly basis to review needs, if any, and to ensure that the Company is operating within the approved limitations. Advances from FHLBNY. The Bank had outstanding borrowings at December 31, 2021 and 2020 of $106.3 million and $117.3 million, respectively. These borrowings are in the form of advances from the FHLBNY. Warehouse Lines of Credit . Mortgage World maintained two warehouse lines of credit with financial institutions for the purpose of funding the origination and sale of residential mortgages. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, Mortgage World utilized $15.1 million and $30.0 million, respectively, for funding of mortgage loans held for sale and had unused lines of credit of $14.9 million and $4.9 million, respectively. The Bank anticipates maintaining these warehouse lines of credit. Stockholders’ Equity. The Company’s consolidated stockholders’ equity increased $29.7 million, or 18.6%, to $189.3 million at December 31, 2021, from $159.5 million at December 31, 2020. The $29.7 million increase in stockholders’ equity was mainly attributable to $25.4 million in net income, of which, $20.3 million related to the gain, net of expenses, from the sale of real properties, $3.1 million in net treasury stock activities, $1.4 million related to share-based compensation and $1.3 million related to the Company’s Employee Stock Ownership Plan, offset by $1.6 million related to unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities, net of taxes. 60 Comparison of Results of Operations for the Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 The discussion of the Company’s results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are presented below. The results of operations for periods may not be indicative of future results. Ponce Financial Group, Inc., as the successor by merger with PDL Community Bancorp Consolidated Overview. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $25.4 million compared to net income of $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Earnings per basic share was $1.52 and diluted share was $1.51 for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to earnings per basic and diluted share of $0.23 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The $21.6 million increase in net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was attributable to increases of $21.4 million in non-interest income primarily resulting from an increase of $16.1 million in gain, net of expenses, on sale of real properties and $16.9 million in net interest income. The increase in net income was offset by increases of $9.6 million in non-interest expense, $6.8 million in provision for income taxes and $274,000 in provision for loan losses. Interest and Dividend Income. Interest and dividend income increased $13.8 million, or 25.8%, to $67.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $ 53.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Interest income on loans receivable, which is the Company’s primary source of income, increased $13.1 million, or 25.1%, to $65.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $ 52.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to an increase in average loans receivable due mostly to PPP lending. Average loans receivable increased $243.7 million, or 22.8% to $1.31 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to $1.07 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 . Interest and dividend on available-for-sale securities and FHLBNY stock and deposits due from banks increased $616,000, or 64.8%, to $1.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $ 950,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020. Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased $3.1 million, or 27.4%, to $8.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to lower market interest rates. Net Interest Income. Net interest income increased $16.9 million, or 40.2%, to $58.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $42.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in net interest income for the year December 31, 2021 compared to year ended December 31, 2020 was attributable to an increase of $13.8 million in interest and dividend income primarily due to an increase in average loans receivable due mostly to additional PPP lending and a decrease of $3.1 million in interest expense due primarily to a lower average cost of funds on interest bearing liabilities. Net interest rate spread increased by 53 basis points to 3.90% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 3.37% for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in the net interest rate spread for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in the average rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities of 51 basis points to 0.80% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 1.31% for the year ended December 31, 2020, and a slight increase in the average yields on interest-earning assets of 2 basis points to 4.70% for the year ended December 31, 2021 from 4.68% for the year ended December 31, 2020. Net interest margin increased 44 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2021, to 4.13% from 3.69% for the year ended December 31, 2020, reflecting both our organic loan growth and the amortization of fee income from our PPP lending. The historically low benchmark federal funds interest rate of the last several years implemented in response the turmoil resulting from COVID-19 pandemic is ending. The Federal Reserve Board increased the benchmark federal funds interest rate by 25 basis points on March 16, 2022. The Federal Reserve Board has signaled that there will likely be additional federal funds interest rate increases during 2022; maybe as many as six more. The recent increase and the anticipated increases are in response to inflation rising at a rate not seen in over 40 years. Because of this rising rate environment, the speed with which it is anticipated to be implemented, the significant competitive pressures in our markets and the potential negative impact of these factors on our deposit and loan pricing, our net interest margin may be negatively impacted. Our net interest income may also be negatively impacted if the demand for loans decreases due to the rate increases, alone or in tandem with the concurrent inflationary pressures. We may be negatively impacted if we are unable to appropriately time adjustments to our funding costs and the rates we earn on our loans. The Bank believes it is well positioned to withstand this rising interest rate environment in the near term as it is asset sensitive. Non-Interest Income. Non-interest income increased $21.4 million to $34.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $13.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to increases of $16.1 million in gain, net of expenses, from the sale of real properties, $2.1 million in loan origination fees and $1.1 million income on sale of mortgage loans. Other increases include $849,000 in late and prepayment charges, $765,000 in service charges and fees, $350,000 in brokerage commissions and $92,000 in other non-interest income. Excluding the $16.1 million increase in gain, net of expense, from the sale of real properties, non-interest income increased $5.3 million to $14.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. Non-Interest Expense. Non-interest expense increased $9.6 million, or 20.2%, to $57.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $47.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was attributable to increases of $2.4 million in direct loan expenses, 61 $1. 8 million in occupancy and equipment, $1.6 million in professional fees, primarily due to an increase in consulting expenses related to a third-party service provider that provided loan origination services related to PPP loans and $1.2 million in compensation and benefits. Other increases in non-interest expense include $ 1.2 million in other operating expenses, $878,000 in data processing expenses, $655,000 in office supplies, telephone and postage and $113,000 in regulatory dues, offset by a decrease of $282,000 in marketing and promotional expenses. The $ 1.2 million increase in compensation and benefits was primarily attributable to $867,000 of ESOP expenses of which $ 700 ,000 was attributable to an additional 48,250 shares to be released as of December 31, 2021 and $ 334 ,000 in bonuses . Income Tax Provision. The Company had a provision for income tax expense of $8.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to $1.4 million for year ended December 31, 2020 , resulting in effective tax rates of 24.0% and 26.4%, respectively. The decrease in the effective tax rate is attributable to a decrease of $1.1 million in the valuation allowance related to the unused non-deductible portion of the remaining charitable contribution deduction. Segments. At December 31, 2021, t he Company had two reportable segments: the Bank and Mortgage World. Income from the Bank consisted primarily of interest and fees earned on loans and investment securities and service charges on deposit accounts. Income from Mortgage World consists primarily of taking of applications from the general public for residential mortgage loans, underwriting them to investors’ standards, closing and funding them and holding them until they were sold to investors. The table below shows the results of operations for the Company’s segments, the Bank and Mortgage World, for the periods indicated.

The Bank’s total assets increased $314.7 million, or 23.9%, to $1.63 billion at December 31, 2021 from $1.32 billion at December 31, 2020. The increase of $314.7 million in the Bank’s total assets was primarily due to increases of $146.4 million in loans receivable, $95.8 million in available-for-sale securities, $79.7 million in cash and cash equivalents, $6.6 million in other assets, $936,000 in accrued interest receivable and $74,000 in deferred tax assets.

Net Income. The Bank’s net income was $28.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to net income of $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. The $23.3 million increase in net income was attributable to increases of $18.8 million in non-interest income, primarily due to a $16.1 gain, net of expense, on sale of real properties, $16.9 million on net interest income, offset by increases in $7.0 million in provision in income taxes, $5.2 million in non-interest expense and $274,000 in provision for loan losses. Interest and Dividend Income. Interest and dividend income increased $13.6 million, or 25.6%, to $66.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $53.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.

Net interest income increased $16.9 million, or 40.6%, to $58.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $41.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily as a result of organic loan growth and a lower average cost of funds on interest bearing liabilities. Provision for loan losses. The provision for loan losses represents a charge to earnings necessary to establish the ALLL that, in management’s opinion, should be adequate to provide coverage for the inherent losses on outstanding loans. In evaluating the level of the ALLL, management analyzes several qualitative loan portfolio risk factors including, but not limited to, management’s ongoing review and grading of loans, facts and issues related to specific loans, historical loan loss and delinquency experience, trends in past due and non-accrual loans, existing risk characteristics of specific loans or loan pools, the fair value of underlying collateral, current economic conditions and other qualitative and quantitative factors which could affect potential credit losses. See Note 1, “Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies —Allowance for Loan Losses” of the Notes to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. After an evaluation of these factors, the Bank established a provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2021 of $ 2.7 million compared to $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. T o the best of management’s knowledge, the Bank recorded all loan losses that are both probable and reasonably expected at December 31, 2021. However, future changes in the factors described above, including, but not limited to, actual loss experience with respect to the Bank’s loan portfolio, could result in material increases in the Bank’s provision for loan losses. 65 In addition, the OCC, as an integral part of its examination process, periodically reviews the Bank’s allowance for loan losses and as a result of such reviews, the Bank may determine to adjust the ALLL. However, regulatory agencies are not directly involved in establishing the ALLL as the process is management’s responsibility and any increase or decrease in the allowance is the responsibility of management. The Bank has selected the CECL model and has begun running parallel scenarios. The extent of the change to ALLL is indeterminable at this time as it will be dependent upon the portfolio composition and credit quality at the adoption date, as well as economic conditions and forecasts at that time. The Company is taking advantage of the extended transition period for complying with this new accounting standard. Assuming it remains a smaller reporting company, the Bank will adopt the CECL standard for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. See Note 1, “Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the CECL standard. Non-interest Income . Non-interest income increased $18.8 million to $26.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 from $7.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 .

Consolidated net income for the year ended December 31, 2020, was $3.9 million compared to a net loss of ($5.1 million) for the year ended December 31, 2019. The change in net income reflects a $10.6 million, or 393.7%, increase in non-interest income, mainly as a result of a $4.2 million gain, net of expenses, on the sale of real property and $6.2 million of non-interest income attributable to Mortgage World operations. Net income was also impacted by a $2.8 million, or 5.6%, increase in interest and dividend income, a $989,000, or 8.0%, decrease in interest expense, offset by a $2.3 million increase in provision for income taxes, a $2.2 million increase in provision for loan losses in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and a $932,000, or 2.0%, increase in non-interest expense. Mortgage World’s net income from July 10, 2020 through December 31, 2020 was $1.8 million, attributable to $6.2 million in non-interest income and $274,000 in interest and dividend income, offset by $3.9 million in non-interest expense, $521,000 in provision for income taxes and $250,000 in interest expense. Interest and Dividend Income . Interest and dividend income increased $ 2.8 million, or 5.6 %, to $53.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $50.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase was primarily due to a $3.1 million, or 6.3%, increase in interest income on loans, which is our primary source of interest income, offset by a decrease of $235,000 of other interest and dividend income. Average loan balances increased $122.6 million, or 13.0 %, to $ 1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $946.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in average loan balances was mainly driven by increases in business loans, of which $50.6 million related to PPP loans, multifamily residential loans, one-to-four family residential loans, nonresidential loans, and construction and land mortgage loans. The average yield on loans decreased 31 basis points to 4.90 % for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 5.21% for the year ended December 31, 2019. 68 The following table presents interest income on loans for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, Change 2020 2019 Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) 1-4 Family residential $ 20,538 $ 20,339 $ 199 1.0 % Multifamily residential 12,990 12,053 937 7.8 % Nonresidential properties 9,838 9,621 217 2.3 % Construction and land 6,827 6,374 453 7.1 % Business loans 1,727 824 903 109.6 % Consumer loans 469 95 374 393.7 % Total interest income on loans receivable $ 52,389 $ 49,306 $ 3,083 6.3 % Interest income on deposits due from banks and available-for-sale securities and dividend income from FHLBNY stock decreased $ 235,000 , or 19.8 %, to $950,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.

The following table presents interest and dividend income on deposits due from banks, available-for-sale securities and FHLBNY stock for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, Change 2020 2019 Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) Interest on deposits due from banks $ 84 $ 617 $ (533 ) (86.4 %) Interest on available-for-sale securities 515 362 153 42.3 % Dividend on FHLBNY stock 351 206 145 70.4 % Total interest and dividend income $ 950 $ 1,185 $ (235 ) (19.8 %) Interest Expense . Interest expense decreased $989 ,000, or 8.0 %, to $11.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020, from $12.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Interest expense on certificates of deposit decreased $1.1 million, or 14.3%, to $6.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The average balance on certificates of deposit decreased $23.7 million, or 5.9 %, to $379.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $ 403.0 million for the same period last year, and the average rate the Bank paid on certificates of deposit decreased 17 basis points to 1.73% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 1.90 % for the same period in 2019. Interest expense on money market accounts decrea sed $680,000, or 26.7%, to $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $ 2.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The average balance of money market accounts increased $82.7 million, or 66.3%, to $207.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $ 124.7 million for the same period last year, while the average rate paid on money market accounts decreased 114 basis points to 0.90% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 2.04 % for the year ended December 31, 2019. Interest expense on borrowings increased $765,000, or 41.3%, to $2.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $ 1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The average balance on borrowings increased $43.6 million, or 56.1 %, to $121.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $ 77.6 million for the same period last year, and the average rate the Bank paid on borrowings decreased 23 basis points to 2.16% fo r the year ended December 31, 2020 from 2.39 % for the same period in 2019. 69 The following table presents interest expense for the periods indicated: For the Years Ended December 31, Change 2020 2019 Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) Certificates of deposit $ 6,576 $ 7,677 $ (1,101 ) (14.3 %) Money market 1,869 2,549 (680 ) (26.7 %) Savings 148 152 (4 ) (2.6 %) NOW/IOLA 153 122 31 25.4 % Advance payments by borrowers 4 4 — 0.0 % Borrowings 2,619 1,854 765 41.3 % Total interest expense $ 11,369 $ 12,358 $ (989 ) (8.0 %) Net Interest Income . Net interest income increased $3.8 million, or 10.1 %, to $ 42.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $38.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 , primarily as a result of organic loan growth and lower average cost of funds on interest bearing liabilities. Average net interest-earning assets increased by $28.3 million, or 11.6%, to $273.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $ 245.4 million for the same period in 2019, due primarily to increases of $122.6 million in average loans and mortgage loans held for sale, $18.2 million in FHLBNY demand account and FHLBNY stock dividends, a decrease of $23.7 million in average certificates of deposit, offset by increases of $82.7 million in average money market accounts, $43.6 million in average borrowings and a decrease of $8.3 million in average securities. The net interest rate spread decreased by 3 basis points to 3.37% for the year ended December 31, 2020 from 3.40 % for the year ended December 31, 2019, and the net interest margin decreased by 10 basis points to 3.69% from 3.79% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Management continues to deploy various asset and liability management strategies to manage the Company’s risk of interest rate fluctuations. Net interest margin decreased 10 basis points for the year ended December 31, 2020, to 3.69% from 3.79% for the year ended December 31, 2019, reflecting that pricing for creditworthy borrowers and meaningful depositors remained very competitive and evidencing the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. Provision for Loan Losses . The Bank established a provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $2.4 million compared to $258,000 for the year ended December 31, 2019. The Bank’s assessment of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on borrowers indicated that it would likely be a detriment to their ability to repay in the short-term and that the likelihood of long-term detrimental effects depends significantly on the resumption of normalized economic activities, a factor not yet determinable. The increase of $2.2 million in provision of loan losses was primarily driven by increases of $ 1.3 million in multifamily residential, $658,000 in 1-4 family investor owned residential mortgage, $426,000 in nonresidential properties, $334,000 in 1-4 family owner-occupied residential mortgage and $270,000 in consumer loans offset by decreases of $703,000 in business loans and $113,000 in construction and land. The ALLL was $14.9 million, or 1.27% of total loans, at December 31, 2020 , compared to $12.3 million, or 1.28% of total loans, at December 31, 2019. Excluding $85.3 million in PPP loans, the ALLL at December 31, 2020 would have been 1.37% of total loans. Non-interest Income . Consolidated non-interest income increased $10.6 million, to $13.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 from $2.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in non-interest income for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019 was primarily due to a $4.2 million gain, net of expenses, on the sale of real property, combined with $6.2 million in gain on sale of mortgage loans, loan origination fees, brokerage commissions and other non-interest income attributable to Mortgage World operations. The increase in non-interest income also was the result of $429,000 in other non-interest income and $228,000 in brokerage commissions related to the Bank, offset by decreases of $397,000 in late and prepayment charges related to mortgage loans and $79,000 in service charges and fees related to the Bank . Mortgage World’s non-interest income from July 10, 2020 through December 31, 2020 was $6.2 million, consisting of $4.1 million in income on sale of mortgage loans, $925,000 in loan origination fees, $627,000 in other non-interest income and $535,000 in brokerage commissions. 70 The following table presents non-interest income for the periods indicated : For the Years Ended December 31, Change 2020 2019 Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) Service charges and fees $ 892 $ 971 $ (79 ) (8.1 %) Brokerage commissions 974 212 762 359.4 % Late and prepayment charges 358 755 (397 ) (52.6 %) Income on sale of mortgage loans 4,120 — 4,120 — % Loan origination 925 — 925 — % Gain on sale of real property 4,177 — 4,177 — % Other 1,801 745 1,056 141.7 % Total non-interest income $ 13,247 $ 2,683 $ 10,564 393.7 % Non-interest Expense. Consolidated n on-interest expense increased $932,000 , or 2.0 %, to $47.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 , compared to $46.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in non-interest expense was primarily attributable to $3.9 million in non-interest expense related to Mortgage World operations, of which $2.3 million was related to compensation and benefits. The remainder of the increases in non-interest expense attributable to the Bank were $2.8 million in professional fees, $1.6 million in occupancy and equipment expense due to new software licenses and security services, $838,000 in compensation and benefits, $686,000 in other operating expenses mainly due to employment agency fees and collection fees, $544,000 in data processing expenses as a result of system enhancements and implementation charges related to new software upgrades and $319,000 in marketing and promotional expenses attributable to the Bank. The increases in non-interest expense were offset by the absence of the non-recurring $9.9 million loss on the termination of the pension plan related to the Bank, recognized in the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase of $2.8 million attributable to the Bank in professional fees was mainly attributable to increases in consulting fees of $1.8 million and professional services of $1.0 million related to the document imaging project adopted in late 2019. Included in non-interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $1.1 million of expenses incurred as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Excluding the impact of the $3.9 million in non-interest expense related to Mortgage World for the year ended December 31, 2020 and the $9.9 million loss on termination of pension plan related to the Bank recognized in the fourth quarter of 2019, total non-interest expense would have increased $7.0 million, or 19.0%, to $43.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to $36.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 . Mortgage World’s non-interest expense from July 10, 2020 through December 31, 2020 was $3.9 million, consisting primarily of $2.3 million in compensation and benefits, $792,000 in direct loan expenses, $322,000 in occupancy and equipment and $279,000 in other operating expenses. The following table presents non-interest expense for the periods indicated. For the Years Ended December 31, Change 2020 2019 Amount Percent (Dollars in thousands) Compensation and benefits $ 22,053 $ 18,883 $ 3,170 16.8 % Loss on termination of pension plan — 9,930 (9,930 ) (100.0 %) Occupancy and equipment 9,564 7,612 1,952 25.6 % Data processing expenses 2,137 1,576 561 35.6 % Direct loan expenses 1,447 692 755 109.1 % Insurance and surety bond premiums 553 414 139 33.6 % Office supplies, telephone and postage 1,399 1,185 214 18.1 % Professional fees 6,049 3,237 2,812 86.9 % Marketing and promotional expenses 488 158 330 208.9 % Directors fees 276 294 (18 ) (6.1 %) Regulatory dues 210 231 (21 ) (9.1 %) Other operating expenses 3,363 2,395 968 40.4 % Total non-interest expense $ 47,539 $ 46,607 $ 932 2.0 % 71 Income Tax Expense . Consolidated income tax expense was $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and ($924,000) in income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2019, resulting in effective tax rates of 26.4 % and 15.3 %, respectively. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, net deferred tax assets amounted to $4.7 million and $ 3.7 million, respectively. 72 Average Balance Sheet The following table sets forth average outstanding balances, average yields and rates, and certain other information for the periods indicated. No tax-equivalent yield adjustments have been made, as the effects would be immaterial. Average balances are derived from average daily balances. Non-accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances. The yields set forth below include the effect of deferred fees, discounts, and premiums that are amortized or accreted to interest income or interest expense. For the Years Ended December 31, 2020 2019 Average Average Outstanding Average Outstanding Average Balance Interest Yield/Rate Balance Interest Yield/Rate (Dollars in thousands) Interest-earning assets: Loans (1) $ 1,068,785 $ 52,389 4.90 % $ 946,159 $ 49,306 5.21 % Securities (2) 16,473 515 3.13 % 24,778 362 1.46 % Other (3) 53,683 435 0.81 % 35,517 823 2.32 % Total interest-earning assets 1,138,941 53,339 4.68 % 1,006,454 50,491 5.02 % Non-interest-earning assets 56,415 35,504 Total assets $ 1,195,356 $ 1,041,958 Interest-bearing liabilities: NOW/IOLA $ 29,792 $ 153 0.51 % $ 27,539 $ 122 0.44 % Money market 207,454 1,869 0.90 % 124,729 2,548 2.04 % Savings 118,956 148 0.12 % 119,521 153 0.13 % Certificates of deposit 379,276 6,576 1.73 % 403,010 7,677 1.90 % Total deposits 735,478 8,746 1.19 % 674,799 10,500 1.56 % Advance payments by borrowers 8,463 4 0.05 % 8,608 4 0.05 % Borrowings 121,193 2,619 2.16 % 77,621 1,854 2.39 % Total interest-bearing liabilities 865,134 11,369 1.31 % 761,028 12,358 1.62 % Non-interest-bearing liabilities: Non-interest-bearing demand 164,555 — 110,745 — Other non-interest-bearing liabilities 6,603 — 3,900 — Total non-interest-bearing liabilities 171,158 — 114,645 — Total liabilities 1,036,292 11,369 875,673 12,358 Total equity 159,064 166,285 Total liabilities and total equity $ 1,195,356 1.31 % $ 1,041,958 1.62 % Net interest income $ 41,970 $ 38,133 Net interest rate spread (4) 3.37 % 3.40 % Net interest-earning assets (5) $ 273,807 $ 245,426 Net interest margin (6) 3.69 % 3.79 % Average interest-earning assets to interest-bearing liabilities 131.65 % 132.25 % (1) Loans includes loans and mortgage loans held for sale, at fair value. (2) Securities include available-for-sale securities and held-to-maturity securities. (3) Includes FHLBNY demand account and FHLBNY stock dividends. (4) Net interest rate spread represents the difference between the weighted average yield on interest-earning assets and the weighted average rate of interest-bearing liabilities. (5) Net interest-earning assets represent total interest-earning assets less total interest-bearing liabilities. (6) Net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average total interest-earning assets. 73 Rate/Volume Analysis The following table presents the effects of changing rates and volumes on the Company’s net interest income for the periods indicated. The volume column shows the effects attributable to changes in volume (changes in volume multiplied by prior rate). The rate column shows the effects attributable to changes in rate (changes in rate multiplied by prior volume). The total column represents the sum of the prior columns. For purposes of this table, changes attributable to both rate and volume, which cannot be segregated, have been allocated proportionately based on the changes due to rate and the changes due to volume. For the Years Ended December 31, 2020 vs. 2019 Increase (Decrease) Due to Total Increase Volume Rate (Decrease) (In thousands) Interest-earning assets: Loans (1) $ 6,390 $ (3,307 ) $ 3,083 Securities (2) (121 ) 274 153 Other 421 (809 ) (388 ) Total interest-earning assets 6,690 (3,842 ) 2,848 Interest-bearing liabilities: NOW/IOLA 10 21 31 Money Market 1,690 (2,369 ) (679 ) Savings (1 ) (4 ) (5 ) Certificates of deposit (452 ) (649 ) (1,101 ) Total deposits 1,247 (3,001 ) (1,754 ) Borrowings 1,041 (276 ) 765 Total interest-bearing liabilities 2,288 (3,277 ) (989 ) Change in net interest income $ 4,402 $ (565 ) $ 3,837 (1) Loans includes loans and mortgage loans held for sale, at fair value. (2) Securities include available-for-sale securities and held-to-maturity securities. Management of Market Risk General . The most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk because, as a financial institution, the majority of the Bank’s assets and liabilities are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Therefore, a principal part of our operations is to manage interest rate risk and limit the exposure of its financial condition and results of operations to changes in market interest rates. The Bank’s Asset/Liability Management Committee is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in the Bank’s assets and liabilities, for determining the level of risk that is appropriate, given the business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with policies and guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. The Bank currently utilizes a third-party modeling solution that is prepared on a quarterly basis, to evaluate its sensitivity to changing interest rates, given the Bank’s business strategy, operating environment, capital, liquidity and performance objectives, and for managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the Board of Directors. The Bank does not engage in hedging activities, such as engaging in futures, options or swap transactions, or investing in high-risk mortgage derivatives, such as collateralized mortgage obligation residual interests, real estate mortgage investment conduit residual interests or stripped mortgage backed securities. Mortgage World did not engage in hedging activities to cover the risks of interest rate movements while it held mortgages for sale. The then low mortgage interest rates and their limited volatility had effectively mitigated such risks. Net Interest Income Simulation Models . Management utilizes a respected, sophisticated third party designed asset liability modeling software that measures the Bank’s earnings through simulation modeling. Earning assets, interest-bearing liabilities and off-balance sheet financial instruments are combined with forecasts of interest rates for the next 12 months and are combined with other factors in order to produce various earnings simulations over that same 12-month period. To limit interest rate risk, the Bank has policy guidelines for earnings risk which seek to limit the variance of net interest income in both gradual and instantaneous changes to interest rates. As of December 31, 2021 , in the event of an instantaneous upward and downward change in rates from management's level interest rate forecast over the next twelve months, assuming a static balance sheet, the following estimated changes are calculated: 74 Net Interest Income Year 1 Change Rate Shift (basis points) (1) Year 1 Forecast from Level (Dollars in thousands) +400 $ 59,506 (4.34 %) +300 60,259 (3.13 %) +200 61,001 (1.94 %) +100 61,694 (0.82 %) Level 62,205 — % -100 61,340 (1.39 %) (1) Assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities. Although an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios, management believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Further, the earnings simulation model does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships, and changing product spreads that could alter any potential adverse impact of changes in interest rates. The behavior of the deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios set out in the table above is a key assumption in the projected estimates of net interest income. The projected impact on net interest income in the table above assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternative rate environments. In higher rate scenarios, any customer activity resulting in the replacement of low-cost or noninterest-bearing deposits with higher-yielding deposits or market-based funding would reduce the benefit in those scenarios. At December 31, 2021, the earnings simulation model indicated that the Bank was in compliance with the Board of Directors approved Interest Rate Risk Policy. Economic Value of Equity Model . While earnings simulation modeling attempts to determine the impact of a changing rate environment to net interest income, the Economic Value of Equity Model (“EVE”) measures estimated changes to the economic values of assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items as a result of interest rate changes. Economic values are determined by discounting expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet items, which establishes a base case EVE. Rates are then shocked as prescribed by the Interest Rate Risk Policy to measure the sensitivity in EVE values for each of those shocked rate scenarios versus the base case. The Interest Rate Risk Policy sets limits for those sensitivities. At December 31, 2021, the EVE modeling calculated the following estimated changes in EVE due to instantaneous upward and downward changes in rates: EVE as a Percentage of Present Value of Assets (3) Estimated Increase (Decrease) in Increase Change in Interest Estimated EVE EVE (Decrease) Rates (basis points) (1) EVE (2) Amount Percent Ratio (4) (basis points) (Dollars in thousands) +400 $ 168,862 $ (44,792 ) (20.96 %) 10.96 % (2,096 ) +300 180,501 (33,153 ) (15.52 %) 11.49 % (1,552 ) +200 192,021 $ (21,633 ) (10.13 %) 11.98 % (1,013 ) +100 203,863 (9,791 ) (4.58 %) 12.47 % (458 ) Level 213,654 — — % 12.82 % — -100 230,441 16,787 7.86 % 13.57 % 786 (1) Assumes an instantaneous uniform change in interest rates at all maturities. (2) EVE is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts. (3) Present value of assets represents the discounted present value of incoming cash flows on interest-earning assets. (4) EVE Ratio represents EVE divided by the present value of assets. Although an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios, management believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact. Since EVE measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments, the change in EVE does not directly correlate to the 75 degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon (i.e., the current year). Further, EVE does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth, changes in product mix, changes in yield curve relationships and changing product spreads that could alter the adverse impact of changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2021, the EVE model indicated that the Bank was in compliance with the Board of Directors approved Interest Rate Risk Policy. Most Likely Earnings Simulation Models . Management also analyzes a most-likely earnings simulation scenario that projects the expected change in rates based on a forward yield curve adopted by management using expected balance sheet volumes forecasted by management. Separate growth assumptions are developed for loans, investments, deposits, etc. Other interest rate scenarios analyzed by management may include delayed rate shocks, yield curve steepening or flattening, or other variations in rate movements to further analyze or stress the balance sheet under various interest rate scenarios. Each scenario is evaluated by management and weighted to determine the most likely result. These processes assist management to better anticipate financial results and, as a result, management may determine the need to review other operating strategies and tactics which might enhance results or better position the balance sheet to reduce interest rate risk going forward. Each of the above analyses may not, on its own, be an accurate indicator of how net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates. Income associated with interest-earning assets and costs associated with interest-bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates. In addition, the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income. For example, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market rates, while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates. In addition, certain assets, such as adjustable rate mortgage loans, have features (generally referred to as interest rate caps and floors) which limit changes in interest rates. Prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the maturity of certain instruments. The ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease during periods of rising interest rates. The Asset/Liability Committee reviews each of the above interest rate sensitivity analyses along with several different interest rate scenarios as part of its responsibility to provide a satisfactory, consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity, loan, investment, borrowing and capital policies. Management's model governance, model implementation and model validation processes and controls are subject to review in the Bank’s regulatory examinations to ensure they are in compliance with the most recent regulatory guidelines and industry and regulatory practices. Management utilizes a respected, sophisticated third party designed asset liability modeling software to help ensure implementation of management's assumptions into the model are processed as intended in a robust manner. That said, there are numerous assumptions regarding financial instrument behaviors that are integrated into the model. The assumptions are formulated by combining observations gleaned from the Bank’s historical studies of financial instruments and the best estimations of how, if at all, these instruments may behave in the future given changes in economic conditions, technology, etc. These assumptions may prove to be inaccurate. Additionally, given the large number of assumptions built into Bank’s asset liability modeling software, it is difficult, at best, to compare its results to other banks. The Asset/Liability Management Committee may determine that the Company should over time become more or less asset or liability sensitive depending on the underlying balance sheet circumstances and its conclusions regarding interest rate fluctuations in future periods. The historically low benchmark federal funds interest rate of the last several years implemented in response the turmoil resulting from COVID-19 pandemic is ending. The Federal Reserve Board increased the benchmark federal funds interest rate by 25 basis points on March 16, 2022. The Federal Reserve Board has signaled that there will likely be additional federal funds interest rate increases during 2022; maybe as many as six more. The recent increase and the anticipated increases are in response to inflation rising at a rate not seen in over 40 years. Because of this rising rate environment, the speed with which it is anticipated to be implemented, the significant competitive pressures in our markets and the potential negative impact of these factors on our deposit and loan pricing, our net interest margin may be negatively impacted. Our net interest income may also be negatively impacted if the demand for loans decreases due to the rate increases, alone or in tandem with the concurrent inflationary pressures. We may be negatively impacted if we are unable to appropriately time adjustments to our funding costs and the rates we earn on our loans. The Bank believes it is well positioned to withstand this rising interest rate environment in the near term as it is asset sensitive. 76 GAP Analysis . In addition, management analyzes interest rate sensitivity by monitoring the Bank’s interest rate sensitivity ""gap."" The interest rate sensitivity gap is the difference between the amount of interest-earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing-liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period. A gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets maturing or repricing during a period exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing during the same period, and a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities maturing or repricing during a period exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets maturing or repricing during the same period. The following table sets forth the Company’s interest-earning assets and its interest-bearing liabilities at December 31, 2021, which are anticipated to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown based upon certain assumptions. The amounts of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of term to repricing or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability.

Certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodologies used in the above interest rate risk measurements. Modeling changes require making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates. In this regard, the net interest income and economic value tables presented assume that the composition of the interest-sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remains constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities. Accordingly, although the net interest income and EVE tables provide an indication of the interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time, such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on net interest income and EVE and will differ from actual results. Furthermore, although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. Additionally, certain assets, such as adjustable-rate loans, have features that restrict changes in interest rates both on a short-term basis and over the life of the asset. In the event of changes in interest rates, prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the gap table. Interest rate risk calculations also may not reflect the fair values of financial instruments. For example, decreases in market interest rates can increase the fair values of loans, deposits and borrowings. 78 Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity describes the ability to meet the financial obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business. Liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of the Company’s customers and to fund current and planned expenditures. The primary sources of funds are deposits, principal and interest payments on loans and available-for-sale securities and proceeds from the sale of loans. The Bank also has access to borrow from the FHLBNY. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had $106.3 million and $117.3 million, respectively, of term and overnight outstanding advances from the FHLBNY, and also had a guarantee from the FHLBNY through letters of credit of up to $21.5 million and $61.5 million, respectively. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there was eligible collateral of approximately $362.3 million and $336.8 million, respectively, in mortgage loans available to secure advances from the FHLBNY. The Bank also has an unsecured line of credit of $25.0 million with a correspondent bank, of which there was none outstanding at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The Bank did not have any outstanding securities sold under repurchase agreements with brokers as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. Mortgage World maintained two warehouse lines of credit with financial institutions for the purpose of funding the origination and sale of residential mortgage loans, with a maximum credit line of $15.1 million and $ 34.9 million, of which $30.0 million and $ 34.0 million was utilized, with $14.9 million and $ 4.9 million remaining unused, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The Bank anticipates maintaining these warehouse lines of credit. Although maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and available-for-sale securities are predictable sources of funds, deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates, economic conditions, and competition. The most liquid assets are cash and interest-bearing deposits in banks. The levels of these assets are dependent on operating, financing, lending and investing activities during any given period. Net cash provided by (used in) operating activities was $18.6 million and ($27.5 million) for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Net cash used in investing activities, which consists primarily of disbursements for loan originations, offset by principal collections on loans, purchases of available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities, proceeds from maturing of available-for-sale securities and pay downs on mortgage-backed available-for-sale securities, was ($211.1 million ) and ( $ 204.6 million) for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Net cash provided by financing activities, consisting of activities in deposit accounts, liability related to the deposit of funds for subscriptions for the Company’s common stock in connection with its second-step conversion, advances and repurchase of treasury stock , was $274.4 million and $ 276.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Based on the Company’s current assessment of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and current global and regional market conditions on its borrowers, management has determined that these may be a detriment to borrowers’ ability to repay in the short-term and that the likelihood of long-term detrimental effects will depend significantly on the resolution of these factors and the resumption of normalized economic activities, a factor not yet determinable. The Bank’s management also took steps to enhance the Company’s liquidity position by increasing its on balance sheet cash and cash equivalents position in order to meet unforeseen liquidity events and to fund upcoming funding needs . At December 31, 2021 and 2020, all regulatory capital requirements were met, resulting in the Company and the Bank being categorized as well capitalized at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Management is not aware of any conditions or events that would change the Company’s and the Bank’s well capitalized category. Material Cash Requirements Commitments . As a financial services provider, the Company routinely is a party to various financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risks, such as commitments to extend credit and unused lines of credit. Although these contractual obligations represent the Company’s future cash requirements, a significant portion of commitments to extend credit may expire without being drawn upon. Such commitments are subject to the same credit policies and approval process accorded to loans originated. At December 31, 2021 and 2020 , the Company had outstanding commitments to originate loans, and extend credit of $220.5 million and $151.3 million, respectively. It is anticipated that the Company will have sufficient funds available to meet its current lending commitments. Certificates of deposits that are scheduled to mature in less than one year from December 31, 2021 totaled $255.1 million. Management expects that a substantial portion of the maturing time deposits will be renewed. However, if a substantial portion of these deposits are not retained, the Company may utilize FHLBNY advances, unsecured credit lines with correspondent banks, or raise interest rates on deposits to attract new accounts, which may result in higher levels of interest expense. Contractual Obligations . In the ordinary course of its operations, the Company enters into certain contractual obligations. Such obligations include data processing services, operating leases for premises and equipment, agreements with respect to borrowed funds and deposit liabilities. 79 The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 202 1 for the periods indicated below : For the Years Ending December 31, Total 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Thereafter (in thousands) Operating leases $ 49,968 $ 3,591 $ 3,600 $ 3,643 $ 3,600 $ 3,422 $ 32,112 Vendor obligations (1) 28,091 6,332 5,605 4,536 3,896 3,866 3,856 Advances from FHLBNY 106,255 77,880 28,375 — — — — Certificates of deposit 429,479 255,075 48,842 28,899 39,342 53,321 4,000 Total contractual obligation $ 613,793 $ 342,878 $ 86,422 $ 37,078 $ 46,838 $ 60,609 $ 39,968 (1) Amounts are for data processing services, leases of equipment and service implementation. The obligations related to our uncertain tax positions, which are not considered material, have been excluded from the table above because of the uncertainty surrounding the timing and final amounts of settlement, if any. Other Material Cash Requirements. In addition to contractual obligations, the Company’s material cash requirements also includes compensation and benefits expenses for its employees, which were $23.3 million in 2021. The Company also has material cash requirements for occupancy and equipment expenses, excluding depreciation and amortization of $2.5 million, related to rental expenses, general maintenance and cleaning supplies, guard services, software licenses and other miscellaneous expenses, which were $8.8 million in 2021.

Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Basis of Presentation and Consolidation : Ponce Financial Group, Inc., as the successor by merger with PDL Community Bancorp pursuant to the completion of the conversion and reorganization of Ponce Bank Mutual Holding Company from the mutual holding company to the stock holding company form of organization that was effective on January 27, 2022 (hereafter referred to as “we,” “our,” “us,” “Ponce Financial Group, Inc.,” or the “Company”), is the holding company of Ponce Bank (“Ponce Bank” or the “Bank”), a federally chartered stock savings association. Refer to Note 20 Subsequent Events for additional information. The Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements presented herein have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company, its wholly-owned subsidiaries Ponce Bank (the “Bank”) and Mortgage World Bankers, Inc. (“Mortgage World”), and the Bank’s wholly-owned subsidiary, Ponce De Leon Mortgage Corp., which is a mortgage banking entity. All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Nature of Operations: The Company is a savings and loan holding company formed on September 29, 2017 in connection with the reorganization of the Bank into a mutual holding company structure. The Company is subject to the regulation and examination by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. The Company’s business is conducted through the administrative office and 13 full service banking and 5 mortgage loan offices. The banking offices are located in New York City – the Bronx ( 4 branches), Manhattan ( 2 branches), Queens ( 3 branches), Brooklyn ( 3 branches) and Union City ( 1 branch), New Jersey. The mortgage loan offices are located in Queens ( 2 ) and Brooklyn ( 1 ), New York and Englewood Cliffs ( 1 ) and Bergenfield ( 1 ), New Jersey. The Company’s primary market area currently consists of the New York City metropolitan area. The Bank is a federally chartered stock savings association headquartered in the Bronx, New York. It was originally chartered in 1960 as a federally chartered mutual savings and loan association under the name Ponce De Leon Federal Savings and Loan Association. In 1985, the Bank changed its name to “Ponce De Leon Federal Savings Bank.” In 1997, the Bank changed its name again to “Ponce De Leon Federal Bank.” Upon the completion of its reorganization into a mutual holding company structure, the assets and liabilities of Ponce De Leon Federal Bank were transferred to and assumed by the Bank. The Bank is a MDI, a CDFI, and a certified SBA lender. The Bank is subject to comprehensive regulation and examination by the Office of Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”). The Bank’s business primarily consists of taking deposits from the general public and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations and borrowings, in mortgage loans, consisting of one-to-four family residential (both investor-owned and owner-occupied), multifamily residential, nonresidential properties and construction and land, and, to a lesser extent, in business and consumer loans. The Bank also invests in securities, which have historically consisted of U.S. government and federal agency securities and securities issued by government-sponsored or owned enterprises, mortgage-backed securities and FHLBNY stock. The Bank offers a variety of deposit accounts, including demand, savings, money markets and certificates of deposit accounts. On July 10, 2020 , the Company completed its acquisition of Mortgage World . During the year ended December 31, 2021, Mortgage World was a mortgage banking entity subject to the regulation and examination of the New York State Department of Financial Services. The primary business of Mortgage World was the taking of applications from the general public for residential mortgage loans, underwriting them to investors’ standards, closing and funding them and holding them until they were sold to investors. Although Mortgage World was permitted to do business in various states (New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Florida and Connecticut), it primarily operated in the New York City metropolitan area. Risks and Uncertainties: On February 24, 2022, Russian forces launched significant military action against Ukraine, and sustained conflict and disruption in the region is possible. The impact to Ukraine as well as actions taken by other countries, including new and stricter sanctions imposed by Canada, the United Kingdom, the European Union, the U.S. and other countries and companies and organizations against officials, individuals, regions, and industries in Russia, and actions taken by Russia in response to such sanctions, and each country’s potential response to such sanctions, tensions, and military actions could have a material adverse effect on our operations. 89 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) The COVID-19 pandemic continues to disrupt the global and U.S. economies and as well as the lives of individuals throughout the world. The New York City Metropolitan area continues to experience, although to a much lesser extent, cases of the COVID-19 pandemic. Governments, businesses, and the public are still taking actions to address the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and to mitigate its effects, including vaccinations and masking. The financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to adversely impact several industries within our geographic footprint and impair the ability of the Company’s customers to fulfill their contractual obligations to the Company. This could cause the Company to experience adverse effects on its business operations, loan portfolio, financial condition, and results of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the provision for loan losses amounted $ 2.7 million primarily due to increases in qualitative reserves as the Company continues to assess the economic impacts the COVID-19 pandemic has on our local economy and our loan portfolio. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies: Use of Estimates : In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, as of the date of the consolidated statement of financial condition, and revenues and expenses for the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of the allowance for loan losses, the valuation of real estate acquired in connection with foreclosures or in satisfaction of loans, the valuation of loans held for sale, the valuation of deferred tax assets and investment securities and the estimates relating to the valuation for share-based awards. Significant Group Concentrations of Credit Risk : Most of the Bank's activities are with customers located within New York City. Accordingly, the ultimate collectability of a substantial portion of the Bank's loan portfolio and Mortgage World’s ability to sell originated loans in the secondary markets are susceptible to changes in the local market conditions. Note 4 discusses the types of securities that the Bank invests in. Notes 5 and 12 discuss the types of lending that the Bank engages in, and other concentrations. Cash and Cash Equivalents : Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and amounts due from banks (including items in process of clearing). For purposes of reporting cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. Cash flows from loans originated by the Company, interest-bearing deposits in financial institutions, and deposits are reported net. Included in cash and cash equivalents are restricted cash from escrows and good faith deposits. Escrows consist of U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (“HUD”) upfront mortgage insurance premiums and escrows on unsold mortgages that are held on behalf of borrowers. Good faith deposits consist of deposits received from commercial loan customers for use in various disbursements relating to the closing of a commercial loan. Restricted cash are included in cash and cash equivalents for purposes of the consolidated statement of cash flows. Securities : Management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the date individual investment securities are acquired, and the appropriateness of such classification is reassessed at each statement of financial condition date. Debt securities that management has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity, if any, are classified as ""held-to-maturity"" and recorded at amortized cost. Trading securities, if any, are carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recognized in earnings. Securities not classified as held-to-maturity or trading, are classified as ""available-for-sale"" and recorded at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Purchase premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the terms of the securities. Management evaluates securities for other-than-temporary impairment (“OTTI”) on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation. For securities in an unrealized loss position, management considers the extent and duration of the unrealized loss, and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer. Management also assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell, a security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the entire difference between amortized cost and fair value is recognized as impairment through earnings. For debt securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, the amount of impairment is split into two components as follows: 1) OTTI related to credit loss, which must be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and 2) OTTI related to other factors, which is recognized in other comprehensive income. The credit loss is defined as the difference between the discounted present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis. For equity securities, the entire amount of impairment is recognized through earnings. 90 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Gains and losses on the sale of securities are recorded on the trade date and are determined using the specific-identification method. The sale of a held-to-maturity security within three months of its maturity date or after collection of at least 85 % of the principal outstanding at the time the security was acquired is considered a maturity for purposes of classification and disclosure. Federal Home Loan Bank of New York Stock : The Bank is a member of the FHLBNY. Members are required to own a certain amount of stock based on the level of borrowings and other factors, and may invest in additional amounts. FHLBNY stock is carried at cost, classified as a restricted security, and periodically evaluated for impairment based on ultimate recovery of par value. Both cash and stock dividends are reported as income. Loans Receivable : Loans receivable that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are stated at current unpaid principal balances, net of the allowance for loan losses and including net deferred loan origination fees and costs. Interest income is accrued based on the unpaid principal balance. Loan origination fees, net of certain direct origination costs, are deferred and recognized in interest income using the interest method without anticipating prepayments. A loan is moved to nonaccrual status in accordance with the Company’s policy typically after 90 days of non-payment. The accrual of interest on mortgage and commercial loans is generally discontinued at the time the loan becomes 90 days past due unless the loan is well-secured and in process of collection. Consumer loans are typically charged-off no later than 120 days past due. Past due status is based on contractual terms of the loan. In all cases, loans are placed on nonaccrual status or charged-off if collection of principal or interest is considered doubtful. All nonaccrual loans are considered impaired loans. All interest accrued but not received for loans placed on nonaccrual are reversed against interest income. Interest received on such loans is accounted for on the cash basis or recorded against principal balances, until qualifying for return to accrual. Cash basis interest recognition is only applied on nonaccrual loans with a sufficient collateral margin to ensure no doubt with respect to the collectability of principal. Loans are returned to accrual status when all the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and remain current for a period of time (typically six months) and future payments are reasonably assured. Accrued interest receivable is closely monitored for collectability and will be charged-off in a timely manner if deemed uncollectable. Allowance for Loan Losses : The allowance for loan losses (“ALLL”) is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses. Loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. Management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience, the nature and volume of the portfolio, information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values, economic conditions, and other factors. Allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans, but the entire allowance is available for any loan that, in management’s judgment, should be charged-off. The Company’s assessment of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on borrowers indicates that it is likely that it will be a detriment to their ability to repay in the short-term and that the likelihood of long-term detrimental effects depends significantly on the resumption of normalized economic activities, a factor not yet determinable. The allowance consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the Bank will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. Loans for which the terms have been modified resulting in a concession, and for which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, are considered troubled debt restructurings and classified as impaired. Factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status, collateral value, and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due. Loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired. Management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case-by-case basis, taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower, including the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay, the borrower’s prior payment record, and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed. 91 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Impaired loans are measured for impairment using the fair value of the collateral, present value of cash flows, or the observable market price of the note. Impairment measurement for all collateral dependent loans, excluding accruing troubled debt restructurings, is based on the fair value of collateral, less costs to sell, if necessary. A loan is considered collateral dependent if repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely by the sale or the operation of the underlying collateral. When a loan is modified to troubled debt restructuring, management evaluates for any possible impairment using either the discounted cash flows method, where the value of the modified loan is based on the present value of expected cash flows, discounted at the contractual interest rate of the original loan agreement, or by using the fair value of the collateral less selling costs, if repayment under the modified terms becomes doubtful. The general component covers non‑impaired loans and is based on historical loss experience adjusted for current factors. The historical loss experience is determined by portfolio segment and is based on the actual loss history experienced over a rolling 12 quarter average period. This actual loss experience is supplemented with other economic factors based on the risks present for each portfolio segment. These economic factors include consideration of the following: levels of and trends in delinquencies and impaired loans; levels of and trends in charge-offs and recoveries; trends in volume and terms of loans; effects of any changes in risk selection and underwriting standards; other changes in lending policies, procedures, and practices; experience, ability, and depth of lending management and other relevant staff; national and local economic trends and conditions; industry conditions; and, effects of changes in credit concentrations. When establishing the allowance for loan losses, management categorizes loans into risk categories reflecting individual borrower earnings, liquidity, leverage and cash flow, as well as the nature of underlying collateral. These risk categories and relevant risk characteristics are as follows: Residential and Multifamily Mortgage Loans : Residential and multifamily mortgage loans are secured by first mortgages. These loans are typically underwritten with loan-to-value ratios ranging from 65 % to 90 %. The primary risks involved in residential mortgages are the borrower’s loss of employment, or other significant event, that negatively impacts the source of repayment. Additionally, a serious decline in home values could jeopardize repayment in the event that the underlying collateral needs to be liquidated to pay off the loan . Nonresidential Mortgage Loans : Nonresidential mortgage loans are primarily secured by commercial buildings, office and industrial buildings, warehouses, small retail shopping centers and various special purpose properties, including hotels, restaurants and nursing homes. These loans are typically underwritten at no more than 75 % loan-to-value ratio. Although terms vary, commercial real estate loans generally have amortization periods of 15 to 30 years , as well as balloon payments of 10 to 15 years , and terms which provide that the interest rates are adjusted on a 5 year schedule. Construction and Land Loans : Construction real estate loans consist of vacant land and property that is in the process of improvement. Repayment of these loans can be dependent on the sale of the property to third parties or the successful completion of the improvements by the builder for the end user. In the event a loan is made on property that is not yet improved for the planned development, there is the risk that government approvals will not be granted or will be delayed. Construction loans also run the risk that improvements will not be completed on time or in accordance with specifications and projected costs. Construction real estate loans generally have terms of six months to two years during the construction period with fixed rates or interest rates based on a designated index. Business Loans : Business loans are loans for commercial, corporate and business purposes, including issuing letters of credit. These loans are secured by business assets or may be unsecured and repayment is directly dependent on the successful operation of the borrower’s business and the borrower’s ability to convert the assets to operating revenue. They possess greater risk than most other types of loans because the repayment capacity of the borrower may become inadequate. Business loans generally have terms of five to seven years or less and interest rates that float in accordance with a designated published index. Substantially all such loans are backed by the personal guarantees of the owners of the business. 92 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Consumer Loans : Consumer loans generally have higher interest rates than mortgage loans. The risk involved in consumer loans is the type and nature of the collateral and, in certain cases, the absence of collateral. Consumer loans include passbook loans and other secured and unsecured loans that have been made for a variety of consumer purposes. Included in consumer loans are loans related to Grain. Mortgage Loans Held for Sale : Mortgage loans held for sale, at fair value, include residential mortgages that were originated in accordance with secondary market pricing and underwriting standards. These loans are loans originated by Mortgage World and the Company intends to sell these loans on the secondary market. Mortgage loans held for sale are carried at fair value under the fair value option accounting guidance for financial assets and financial liabilities. The gains or losses for the changes in fair value of these loans are included in income on sale of mortgage loans on the consolidated statements of operations. Interest income on mortgage loans held for sale measured under the fair value option is calculated based on the principal amount of the loan and is included in interest loans receivable on the consolidated statements of operations . Derivative Financial Instruments : The Company, through Mortgage World, uses derivative financial instruments as a part of its price risk management activities. All such derivative financial instruments are designated as free-standing derivative instruments. In accordance with FASB ASC 815-25, Derivatives and Hedging , all derivative instruments are recognized as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at their fair value. Change in the fair value of these derivatives is reported in current period earnings. Additionally, to facilitate the sale of mortgage loans, Mortgage World may enter into forward sale positions on securities, and mandatory delivery positions. Exposure to losses or gains on these positions is limited to the net difference between the calculated amounts to be received and paid. As of December 31, 2021, the Company did not enter into any forward sale or mandatory delivery positions on their financial instruments. Revenue from Contracts with Customers : The Company’s revenue from contracts with customers in the scope of ASC 606, Revenue from Contract with Customers , is recognized within noninterest income. ASC 606 outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers. Management determined the revenue streams impacted by ASC 606 included those related to service charges on deposit accounts, ATM and card fees and other services fees. The Company’s revenue recognition pattern for these revenue streams did not change from current practice. The Company's primary sources of revenue are interest income on financial assets and income from mortgage banking activities, which are explicitly excluded from the scope of ASC 606. COVID-19 Pandemic and the CARES Act : On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) was signed into law. Section 4013 of the CARES Act, “Temporary Relief from Troubled Debt Restructurings,” provides banks the option to temporarily suspend certain requirements under GAAP related to troubled debt restructurings (“TDR”) for a limited period of time to account for the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, on April 7, 2020, the banking agencies, including the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, issued a statement, “Interagency Statement on Loan Modifications and Reporting for Financial Institutions Working With Customers Affected by the Coronavirus (Revised)” (“Interagency Statement”), to encourage banks to work prudently with borrowers and to describe the agencies’ interpretation of how accounting rules under ASC 310-40, “Troubled Debt Restructurings by Creditors,” apply to certain of the COVID-19 pandemic related modifications. Further, on August 3, 2020, the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council issued a Joint Statement on Additional Loan Accommodations related to the COVID-19 pandemic, to provide prudent risk management and consumer protection principles for financial institutions to consider while working with borrowers as loans near the end of initial loan accommodation periods. Under the CARES Act and related Interagency Statement, the Company may temporarily suspend its delinquency and nonperforming treatment for certain loans that have been granted a payment accommodation that facilitates borrowers' ability to work through the immediate impact of the pandemic. The permitted use of this relief expired on January 1, 2022 and the Bank has made appropriate adjustments which are not material. Borrowers who were current prior to becoming affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, then receive payment accommodations as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and if all payments are current in accordance with the revised terms of the loan, generally would not be reported as past due. The Company has chosen to utilize this part of the CARES Act as it relates to delinquencies and nonperforming loans and does not report these loans as past due. 93 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Under Section 4013 of the CARES Act, modifications of loan terms do not automatically result in TDRs and the Company generally does not need to categorize the COVID-19 pandemic-related modifications as TDRs. The Company may elect not to categorize loan modifications as TDRs if they are (1) related to the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) executed on a loan that was not more than 30 days past due as of December 31, 2019; and (3) executed between March 1, 2020, and the earlier of (A) 60 days after the date of termination of the National Emergency or (B) December 31, 2020. This relief was extended by the Consolidated Appropriations Act enacted on December 27, 2020 to the earlier of January 1, 2022 or 60 days after the termination of the national emergency. This relief was not extended beyond January 1, 2022 and the Bank has made appropriate adjustments which are not material. Federal banking agencies were required to defer to the determination of the banks making such election. This includes short-term (e.g., six months) modifications such as payment deferrals, fee waivers, extensions of repayment terms, or other delays in payment that are insignificant. Borrowers considered current are those that are less than 30 days past due on their contractual payments at the time a modification program is implemented. Financial institutions accounting for eligible loans under Section 4013 are not required to apply ASC Subtopic 310-40 to the Section 4013 loans for the term of the loan modification. Financial institutions do not have to report Section 4013 loans as TDRs in regulatory reports, including this Form 10-K. The Company has chosen to utilize this section of the CARES Act and does not report the COVID-19 pandemic related modifications as TDRs. Under the CARES Act and related Interagency Statement, in regard to loans not otherwise reportable as past due, financial institutions are not expected to designate loans with deferrals granted due to the COVID-19 pandemic as past due because of the deferral. A loan's payment date is governed by the due date stipulated in the legal agreement. If a financial institution agrees to a payment deferral, this may result in no contractual payments being past due, and these loans are not considered past due during the period of the deferral. Each financial institution should refer to the applicable regulatory reporting instructions, as well as its internal accounting policies, to determine if loans to distressed borrowers should be reported as nonaccrual assets in regulatory reports. However, during the short-term arrangements, these loans generally should not be reported as nonaccrual. The Company has elected to follow this guidance of the CARES Act and reports loans that have been granted payment deferrals as current so long as they were current at the time the deferral was granted. Transfers of Financial Assets : Transfers of financial assets are accounted for as sales when all of the components meet the definition of a participating interest and when control over the assets has been surrendered. A participating interest generally represents (1) a proportionate (pro rata) ownership interest in an entire financial asset, (2) a relationship where from the date of transfer all cash flows received from the entire financial asset are divided proportionately among the participating interest holders in an amount equal to their share of ownership, (3) the priority of cash flows has certain characteristics, including no reduction in priority, subordination of interest, or recourse to the transferor other than standard representation or warranties, and (4) no party has the right to pledge or exchange the entire financial asset unless all participating interest holders agree to pledge or exchange the entire financial asset. Control over transferred assets is deemed to be surrendered when (1) the assets have been isolated from the Bank, (2) the transferee obtains the right (free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right) to pledge or exchange the transferred assets, and (3) the Bank does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through either (a) an agreement to repurchase them before their maturity or (b) the ability to unilaterally cause the holder to return specific assets, other than through a clean-up call. Premises and Equipment: Premises and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed and charged to operations using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets as follows: Years Building 39 Building improvements 15 - 39 Furniture, fixtures, and equipment 3 - 10 Leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the improvements’ estimated economic lives or the related lease terms, including extensions expected to be exercised. Gains and losses on dispositions are recognized upon realization. Maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred and improvements are capitalized. Leasehold improvements in process are not amortized until the assets are placed in operation. 94 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Impairment of Long-Lived Assets : Long-lived assets, including premises and leasehold improvements are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If impairment is indicated by that review, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value through a charge to noninterest expense. Other Real Estate Owned : Other Real Estate Owned (""OREO"") represents properties acquired through, or in lieu of, loan foreclosure or other proceedings. OREO is initially recorded at fair value, less estimated disposal costs, at the date of foreclosure, which establishes a new cost basis. After foreclosure, the properties are held for sale and are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, less estimated costs of disposal. Any write-down to fair value, at the time of transfer to OREO, is charged to the allowance for loan losses. Properties are evaluated regularly to ensure that the recorded amounts are supported by current fair values and charges against earnings are recorded as necessary to reduce the carrying amount to fair value, less estimated costs to dispose. Costs relating to the development and improvement of the property are capitalized, subject to the limit of fair value of the OREO, while costs relating to holding the property are expensed. Gains or losses are included in operations upon disposal. Income Taxes : The Company recognizes income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. When tax returns are filed, it is highly certain that some positions taken would be sustained upon examination by the taxing authorities, while others are subject to uncertainty about the merits of the position taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained. The benefit of a tax position is recognized in the consolidated financial statements in the period during which, based on all available evidence, management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes, if any. Tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions. Tax positions that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than 50 % likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority. The portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above is reflected as a liability for unrecognized tax benefits along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination. Interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits, if any, would be classified as additional provision for income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations. Related Party Transactions : Directors and officers of the Company and their affiliates have been customers of and have had transactions with the Company, and it is expected that such persons will continue to have such transactions in the future. Management believes that all deposit accounts, loans, services and commitments comprising such transactions were made in the ordinary course of business, on substantially the same terms, including interest rates and collateral, as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with other customers who are not directors or officers. In the opinion of management, the transactions with related parties did not involve more than normal risk of collectability, nor favored treatment or terms, nor present other unfavorable features. Note 16 contains details regarding related party transactions. Employee Benefit Plans: The Company maintains a KSOP, an Employee Stock Ownership Plan with 401(k) provisions incorporated, a Long-Term Incentive Plan that includes grants of restricted stock units and stock options, and a Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (the “SERP”). KSOP, the Employee Stock Ownership Plan with 401(k) Provisions: Compensation expense is recorded as shares are committed to be released with a corresponding credit to unearned KSOP equity account at the average fair market value of the shares during the period and the shares become outstanding for earnings per share computations. Compensation expense is recognized ratably over the service period based upon management’s estimate of the number of shares expected to be allocated by the KSOP. The difference between the average fair market value and the cost of the shares allocated by the KSOP is recorded as an adjustment to additional paid-in-capital. Unallocated common shares held by the Company’s KSOP are shown as a reduction in stockholders’ equity and are excluded from weighted-average common shares outstanding for both basic and diluted earnings per share calculations until they are committed to be released. The 401(k) provisions provide for elective employee/participant deferrals of income. Discretionary matching, profit-sharing, and safe harbor contributions, not to exceed 4 % of employee compensation and profit-sharing contributions may be provided. 95 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Stock Options: The Company recognizes the value of shared-based payment transactions as compensation costs in the financial statements over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award. The fair value of the share-based payments for stock options is estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Company accounts for forfeitures as they occur during the period. Restricted Stock Units: The Company recognizes compensation cost related to restricted stock units based on the market price of the stock units at the grant date over the vesting period. The product of the number of units granted and the grant date market price of the Company’s common stock determines the fair value of restricted stock units. The Company recognizes compensation expense for the fair value of the restricted stock units on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. Comprehensive Income : Comprehensive income consists of net income and other comprehensive income which are both recognized as separate components of equity. Other comprehensive income includes unrealized gains and losses on securities available for sale and unrecognized gains and losses on actuarial loss and prior service cost of the defined benefit plan. Loss Contingencies : Loss contingencies, including claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business, are recorded as liabilities when the likelihood of loss is probable and an amount or range of loss can be reasonably estimated. Management does not believe there are any such matters that will have a material effect on the operations and financial position of the Company. Fair Value of Financial Instruments : Fair value is the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Fair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions, as more fully disclosed in Note 13. Fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding interest rates, credit risk, prepayments, and other factors, especially in the absence of broad markets for particular items. Changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect these estimates. Segment Reporting : The Company’s business is conducted through two business segments: Ponce Bank, which involves the delivery of loan and deposit products to customers, and Mortgage World, which consists of mortgage underwriting and selling such mortgages to investors. Accordingly, all of the financial service operations are considered by management to be aggregated in two reportable operating segments as more fully disclosed in Note 19. Loan Commitments and Related Financial Instruments : Financial instruments include off‑balance sheet credit instruments, such as commitments to make loans and commercial letters of credit, issued to meet customer financing needs. The face amount for these items represents the exposure to loss, before considering customer collateral or ability to repay. Such financial instruments are recorded when they are funded. Earnings (Loss) per Share (“EPS”) : Basic EPS represents net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders divided by the basic weighted average common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common shareholders by the basic weighted average common shares outstanding, plus the effect of potential dilutive common stock equivalents outstanding during the period. Basic weighted common shares outstanding is weighted average common shares outstanding less weighted average unallocated ESOP shares. Treasury Stock : Shares repurchased under the Company’s share repurchase programs were purchased in open-market transactions and are held as treasury stock. The Company accounts for treasury stock under the cost method and includes treasury stock as a component of stockholders’ equity. Reclassification of Prior Year Presentation: Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified for consistency with the current year presentation. These reclassifications had no effect on the reporting results of operations and did not affect previously reported amounts in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. 96 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Recent Accounting Pronouncements: As an emerging growth company (“EGC”) as defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act, the Company has elected to use the extended transition period to delay the adoption of new or reissued accounting pronouncements applicable to public business entities until such pronouncements are made applicable to nonpublic business entities. The Company will be exiting the EGC status as of December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2021, there is no significant difference in the comparability of the consolidated financial statements as a result of this extended transition period. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842).” This ASU requires all lessees to recognize a lease liability and a right-of-use asset, measured at the present value of the future minimum lease payments, at the lease commencement date. Lessor accounting remains largely unchanged under the new guidance. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period, for public business entities. As the Company is taking advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards assuming it remains an EGC, it will adopt the amendments in this update for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022. The Company has begun its evaluation of the amended guidance including the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements. To date, the Company has identified its leased office spaces as within the scope of the guidance. The Company currently leases 13 branches and mortgage offices and the new guidance will result in the establishment of a right to use asset and corresponding lease obligations. The Company continues to evaluate the impact of the guidance, including determining whether other contracts exist that are deemed to be in scope and subsequent related accounting standard updates. The Company has established a project committee and has initiated training on ASU 2016-02. The Company is performing preliminary computations of its right to use asset and corresponding lease obligations for the operating leases of its 13 leased branches and mortgage offices. The Company is utilizing a new lease accounting tool to assist in the computations of its right to use asset and corresponding lease obligations for the operating leases. The Company will adopt this standard at the end of December 2022 and anticipates recognizing approximately $ 35.3 million of right of use asset and approximately $ 35.5 million of operating lease liability. In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, “ Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments.” This ASU significantly changes how entities will measure credit losses for most financial assets and certain other instruments that are not measured at fair value through net income. The standard is to replace today’s “incurred loss” approach with an “expected loss” model. The new model, referred to as the current expected credit loss (“CECL”) model, is to apply to: (1) financial assets subject to credit losses and measured at amortized cost, and (2) certain off-balance sheet credit exposures. This includes, but is not limited to, loans, leases, held-to-maturity securities, loan commitments and financial guarantees. The CECL model does not apply to available-for-sale (“AFS”) debt securities. For AFS debt securities with unrealized losses, entities will measure credit losses in a manner similar to what they do today, except that the losses will be recognized as allowances rather than reductions in the amortized cost of the securities. As a result, entities will recognize improvements to estimated credit losses immediately in earnings rather than as interest income over time, as they do today. The ASU also reportedly simplifies the accounting model for purchased credit-impaired debt, securities and loans. ASU 2016-13 also expands the disclosure requirements regarding an entity’s assumptions, models and methods for estimating the allowance for loan and lease losses. In addition, entities will need to disclose the amortized cost balance for each class of financial asset by credit quality indicator, disaggregated by the year of origination. ASU 2016-13 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years, for public business entities, that are not deemed to be smaller reporting companies as defined by the SEC as of November 15, 2019. As the Company is taking advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards assuming it remains an EGC, it will adopt the amendments in this update for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Entities have to apply the standard’s provisions as a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the first reporting period in which the guidance is effective (i.e., modified retrospective approach). 97 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1. Nature of Business and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies (Continued) Although early adoption is permitted, the Company does not expect to elect that option. The Company has begun its evaluation of the amended guidance including the potential impact on its consolidated financial statements. As a result of the required change in approach toward determining estimated credit losses from the current “incurred loss” model to one based on estimated cash flows over a loan’s contractual life, adjusted for prepayments (a “life of loan” model), the Company expects that the new guidance will result in an increase in the allowance for loan losses, particularly for longer duration loan portfolios. The Company also expects that the new guidance may result in an allowance for available-for-sale debt securities. The Company has selected the CECL model and has begun running scenarios. In both cases, the extent of the change is indeterminable at this time as it will be dependent upon portfolio composition and credit quality at the adoption date, as well as economic conditions and forecasts at that time. In March 2017, the FASB issued ASU 2017-08 “Receivables – Non-Refundable Fees and Other Costs (Subtopic 310-20): Premium Amortization on Purchased Callable Debt Securities.” The ASU requires premiums on callable debt securities to be amortized to the earliest call date. The amendments do not require an accounting change for securities held at a discount; the discount continues to be amortized to maturity. ASU 2017-08 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 for public business entities. Early adoption is permitted beginning after December 15, 2018, including interim periods within those fiscal years. As the Company is taking advantage of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards assuming it remains an EGC, the Company adopted the amendments in this update for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, and interim periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020. ASU 2017-08 did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or disclosures. In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-13, “ Disclosure Framework – Changes to the Disclosure Requirements for Fair Value Measurement .” This ASU eliminates, adds and modifies certain disclosure requirements for fair value measurements. Among the changes, entities will no longer be required to disclose the amount of and reasons for transfers between Level 1 and Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy but will be required to disclose the range and weighted average used to develop significant unobservable inputs for Level 3 fair value measurements. ASU 2018-13 is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019, and early adoption is permitted. The Company adopted this standard which had no material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements . In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12 “ Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes .” The objective of this update is to simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles and improve consistent application and simplify other areas of Topic 740. The amendments in this update are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2020, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this standard which had no material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements . In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, “Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) . ” This ASU provides optional means and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions that reference LIBOR or other reference rates expected to be discontinued because of the reference rate reform. The amendments in this ASU are effective for all entities as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. The Company believes this update will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements. 98 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 2. Business Acquisition On July 10, 2020 , the Company completed its acquisition of 100 percent of the shares of common stock of Mortgage World . The shareholders of Mortgage World received total consideration of $ 1.8 million in cash. The acquisition was accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, and accordingly, assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Mortgage World’s results of operations have been included in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations since July 10, 2020. Mortgage World’s assets and liabilities were transferred to the Bank on January 26, 2022. Refer to Note 20 Subsequent Events for additional information. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition were recorded at their estimated fair values based on management’s best estimates, using information available at the date of the acquisition. The fair values are preliminary estimates and subject to adjustment for up to one year after the closing date of the acquisition. The Company did no t recognize goodwill from the acquisition. The following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed of Mortgage World: Fair Value (in thousands) Fair value of acquisition consideration $ 1,755 Assets: Cash and cash equivalents 750 Mortgage loans held for sale, at fair value 10,549 Premises and equipment, net 302 Other assets 772 Total assets $ 12,373 Liabilities: Warehouse lines of credit $ 9,135 Mortgage loans fundings payable 1,237 Other liabilities 246 Total Liabilities $ 10,618 Net assets $ 1,755 Note 3. Restrictions on Cash and Due From Banks The Bank was previously required to maintain reserve balances in cash or on deposit with the Federal Reserve Bank, based on a percentage of deposits. Effective March 26, 2020, the Federal Reserve Board eliminated reserve requirement for depository institutions to support lending to households and businesses. Cash and cash equivalents include Mortgage World restricted cash which consists of escrows on unsold mortgages that are held on behalf of borrowers and good faith deposits received from commercial loan customers relating to the closing of a commercial loan. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the total amount of restricted cash was $ 70,000 and $ 150,000 , respectively, and were reflected within cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated statements of financial condition. 99 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 4. Securities The amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses, and fair value of securities at December 31, 2021 and 2020 are summarized as follows: December 31, 2021 Gross Gross Amortized Unrealized Unrealized Cost Gains Losses Fair Value (in thousands) Available-for-Sale Securities: U.S. Government Bonds $ 2,981 $ — $ ( 47 ) $ 2,934 Corporate Bonds 21,243 144 ( 203 ) 21,184 Mortgage-Backed Securities: Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (1) 18,845 — ( 497 ) 18,348 FNMA Certificates 71,930 — ( 1,231 ) 70,699 GNMA Certificates 175 6 — 181 Total available-for-sale securities $ 115,174 $ 150 $ ( 1,978 ) $ 113,346 Held-to-Maturity Securities: FHLMC Certificates $ 934 $ — $ ( 20 ) $ 914 Total held-to-maturity securities $ 934 $ — $ ( 20 ) $ 914 (1) Comprised of FHLMC, FNMA and GNMA issued securities.

There were no available-for-sale securities and held-to-maturity securities sold during the year ended December 31, 2020. One security in the amount of $ 2.7 million matured and/or were called during the year ended December 31, 2021 and $ 17.8 million securities matured and/or were called during the year ended December 31, 2020. The Company purchased $ 109.9 million in available-for-sale securities during the year ended December 31, 2021 and $ 13.6 million in available-for-sale securities and $ 1.7 million in held-to-maturity securities during the year ended December 31, 2020. 100 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 4.

At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had 23 and 3 available-for-sale securities, respectively, and one held-to-maturity at December 31, 2021 and 2020 with gross unrealized losses. Management reviewed the financial condition of the entities underlying the securities at both December 31, 2021 and 2020 and determined that they are not other than temporary impaired because the unrealized losses in those securities relate to market interest rate changes. The Company has the ability to hold them and does not have the intent to sell these securities, and it is not more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell these securities, before recovery of the cost basis. In addition, management also considers the issuers of the securities to be financially sound and believes the Company will receive all contractual principal and interest related to these investments. 101 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 4. Securities (Continued) The following is a summary of maturities of securities at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Amounts are shown by contractual maturity. Because borrowers for mortgage-backed securities have the right to prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties, at any time, these securities are included as a total within the table.

Loans Receivable and Allowance for Loan Losses Loans at December 31, 2021 and 2020 are summarized as follows: December 31, December 31, 2021 2020 (in thousands) Mortgage loans: 1-4 family residential Investor-Owned $ 317,304 $ 319,596 Owner-Occupied 96,947 98,795 Multifamily residential 348,300 307,411 Nonresidential properties 239,691 218,929 Construction and land 134,651 105,858 Total mortgage loans 1,136,893 1,050,589 Nonmortgage loans: Business loans (1) 150,512 94,947 Consumer loans (2) 34,693 26,517 Total nonmortgage loans 185,205 121,464 Total loans, gross 1,322,098 1,172,053 Net deferred loan origination costs ( 668 ) 1,457 Allowance for loan losses ( 16,352 ) ( 14,870 ) Loans receivable, net $ 1,305,078 $ 1,158,640 (1) As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, business loans include $ 136.8 million and $ 85.3 million, respectively, of SBA PPP loans. (2) As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, consumer loans include $ 33.9 million and $ 25.5 million, respectively, pursuant to the Bank’s arrangement with Grain. The Company's lending activities are conducted principally in New York City. The Company primarily grants loans secured by real estate to individuals and businesses pursuant to an established credit policy applicable to each type of lending activity in which it engages. Although collateral provides assurance as a secondary source of repayment, the Company ordinarily requires the primary source of repayment to be based on the borrowers' ability to generate continuing cash flows. The Company also evaluates the collateral and creditworthiness of each customer. The credit policy provides that depending on the borrowers’ creditworthiness and type of collateral, credit may be extended up to predetermined percentages of the market value of the collateral or on an unsecured basis. Real estate is the primary form of collateral. Other important forms of collateral are time deposits and marketable securities. For disclosures related to the allowance for loan losses and credit quality, the Company does not have any disaggregated classes of loans below the segment level. Credit-Quality Indicators : Internally assigned risk ratings are used as credit-quality indicators, which are reviewed by management on a quarterly basis. The objectives of the Company’s risk-rating system are to provide the Board of Directors and senior management with an objective assessment of the overall quality of the loan portfolio, to promptly and accurately identify loans with well-defined credit weaknesses so that timely action can be taken to minimize credit loss, to identify relevant trends affecting the collectability of the loan portfolio, to isolate potential problem areas and to provide essential information for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Below are the definitions of the Company's internally assigned risk ratings: Strong Pass – Loans to new or existing borrowers collateralized at least 90 percent by an unimpaired deposit account at the Company. Good Pass – Loans to a new or existing borrower in a well-established enterprise in excellent financial condition with strong liquidity and a history of consistently high level of earnings, cash flow and debt service capacity. 103 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 5. Loans Receivable and Allowance for Loan Losses (Continued) Satisfactory Pass – Loans to a new or existing borrower of average strength with acceptable financial condition, satisfactory record of earnings and sufficient historical and projected cash flow to service the debt. Performance Pass – Loans that evidence strong payment history but document less than average strength, financial condition, record of earnings, or projected cash flows with which to service debt. Special Mention – Loans in this category are currently protected but show one or more potential weaknesses and risks which may inadequately protect collectability or borrower’s ability to meet repayment terms at some future date if the weakness or weaknesses are not monitored or remediated. Substandard – Loans that are inadequately protected by the repayment capacity of the borrower or the current sound net worth of the collateral pledged, if any. Loans in this category have well defined weaknesses and risks that jeopardize their repayment. They are characterized by the distinct possibility that some loss may be sustained if the deficiencies are not remedied. Doubtful – Loans that have all the weaknesses of loans classified as “Substandard” with the added characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full, on the basis of current existing facts, conditions, and values, highly questionable and improbable. Loans within the top four categories above are considered pass rated, as commonly defined. Risk ratings are assigned as necessary to differentiate risk within the portfolio. Risk ratings are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revised to reflect changes in the borrowers’ financial condition and outlook, debt service coverage capability, repayment performance, collateral value and coverage as well as other considerations.

Impaired loans, including troubled debt restructurings, are identified by applying normal loan review procedures in accordance with the allowance for loan losses methodology. Management periodically assesses loans to determine whether impairment exists. Any loan that is, or will potentially be, no longer performing in accordance with the terms of the original loan contract is evaluated to determine impairment. The following information relates to impaired loans as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019: Unpaid Contractual Recorded Investment Recorded Investment Total Average Interest Income Principal With No With Recorded Related Recorded Recognized December 31, 2021 Balance Allowance Allowance Investment Allowance Investment on Cash Basis (in thousands) Mortgages: 1-4 Family $ 13,333 $ 10,535 $ 1,991 $ 12,526 $ 205 $ 12,145 $ 189 Multifamily residential 1,200 1,200 — 1,200 — 1,139 63 Nonresidential properties 3,494 2,637 358 2,995 38 3,941 38 Construction and land 917 917 — 917 — 307 17 Nonmortgage Loans: Business 13 13 — 13 — 13 — Consumer — — — — — 24 — Total $ 18,957 $ 15,302 $ 2,349 $ 17,651 $ 243 $ 17,569 $ 307 107 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 5.

Under applicable standards, loans are modified to troubled debt restructurings when a creditor, for economic or legal reasons related to a debtor’s financial condition, grants a concession to the debtor that it would not otherwise consider, unless it results in a delay in payment that is insignificant. These concessions could include a reduction of interest rate on the loan, payment and maturity extensions, forbearance, or other actions intended to maximize collections. When a loan is modified to a troubled debt restructuring, management evaluates for any possible impairment using either the discounted cash flows method, where the value of the modified loan is based on the present value of expected cash flows, discounted at the contractual interest rate of the original loan agreement, or by using the fair value of the collateral less selling costs if repayment under the modified terms becomes doubtful. If management determines that the value of the modified loan in a troubled debt restructuring is less than the recorded investment in the loan, impairment is recognized through a specific allowance estimate or charge-off to the allowance for loan losses. During the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no loans restructured as a troubled debt restructuring. At December 31, 2021, there were 30 troubled debt restructured loans totaling $ 8.7 million of which $ 6.2 million are on accrual status. At December 31, 2020, there were 32 troubled debt restructured loans totaling $ 9.7 million of which $ 6.6 million are on accrual status. There were no commitments to lend additional funds to borrowers whose loans have been modified in a troubled debt restructuring. The financial impact from the concessions made represents specific impairment reserves on these loans, which aggregated to $ 243,000 and $ 292,000 at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 108 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 5. Loans Receivable and Allowance for Loan Losses (Continued) Loan modifications and payment deferrals as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic that met the criteria established under Section 4013 of the CARES Act or under applicable interagency guidance of the federal banking regulators were excluded from evaluation of TDR classification and reported as current during the payment deferral period. The Company’s policy was to accrue interest during the deferral period. Loans that did not meet the CARES Act or regulatory guidance criteria were evaluated for TDR and non-accrual treatment under the Company’s existing policies and procedures. The permitted use of this relief expired on January 1, 2022 and the Bank has made appropriate adjustments, which are not material. Mortgage Loans Held for Sale at Fair Value At December 31, 2021 and 2020, 27 loans and 70 loans related to Mortgage World in the amount of $ 15.5 million and $ 34.4 million, respectively, were held for sale and accounted for under the fair value option accounting guidance for financial assets and financial liabilities.

Warehouse Lines of Credit: Mortgage World maintains two warehouse lines of credit with financial institutions for the purpose of funding the originations and sale of residential mortgages. The lines of credit are repaid with proceeds from the sale of the mortgage loans. The lines are secured by the assets collaterizing underlying mortgages. The agreements with the warehouse lenders provide for certain restrictive covenants such as minimum net worth and liquidity ratios for Mortgage World. All warehouse facilities are guaranteed by Mortgage World. As of December 31, 2021, Mortgage World was in full compliance with all financial covenants. Warehouse Line of Credit #1 The interest rate is based on the 30-day LIBOR rate plus 3.25 %. The effective rate at December 31, 2021 and 2020 was 3.35 % and 3.39 %, respectively. The line of credit is an evergreen agreement that terminates upon request by either the financial institution or the borrower. Warehouse Line of Credit #2 The interest rate is based on the 30-day LIBOR rate plus 3.00 % for loans funded by wires. The effective rate at December 31, 2021 and 2020 was 3.10 % and 3.14 %, respectively. The warehouse line of credit is due to expire on June 30, 2022 .

This liability is presented at cost and fully offsets the principal balance of the related loans included in mortgage loans held for sale, at fair value on the consolidated statement of financial condition. At December 31, 2021, there were no mortgage loan funding payable. At December 31, 2020 the balance of mortgage loan funding payable was $ 1.5 million. Note 9. Income Taxes The provision (benefit) for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 consists of the following: For the Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 (in thousands) Federal: Current $ 6,107 $ 2,065 $ 878 Deferred 646 ( 839 ) ( 1,436 ) 6,753 1,226 ( 558 ) State and local: Current 842 281 296 Deferred 1,733 ( 353 ) ( 3,002 ) 2,575 ( 72 ) ( 2,706 ) Changes in valuation allowance ( 1,119 ) 228 2,340 Provision (benefit) for income taxes $ 8,209 $ 1,382 $ ( 924 ) Total income tax expense differed from the amounts computed by applying the U.S. federal income tax rate of 21 % for 2021, 2020 and 2019 to income before income taxes as a result of the following: For the Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 (in thousands) Income tax, at federal rate $ 7,195 $ 1,099 $ ( 1,270 ) State and local tax, net of federal taxes 2,034 ( 57 ) ( 2,128 ) Valuation allowance, net of the federal benefit ( 1,119 ) 228 2,340 Other 99 112 134 Provision (benefit) for income taxes $ 8,209 $ 1,382 $ ( 924 ) Management maintains a valuation allowance against its net New York State and New York City deferred tax as it is unlikely these deferred tax assets will impact the Company's tax liability in future years. In 2021 Management recorded a valuation allowance against portion of the charitable contribution carryforward that will expire in 2022 as it is unlikely this deferred tax asset will be utilized. The valuation allowance decreased by $ 1.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and increased by $ 228,000 and $ 2.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 112 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 9. Income Taxes (Continued) Management has determined that it is not required to establish a valuation allowance against any other deferred tax assets in accordance with GAAP since it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be fully utilized in future periods. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management considers the scheduled reversal of the deferred tax liabilities, the level of historical taxable income, and the projected future taxable income over the periods that the temporary differences comprising the deferred tax assets will be deductible. A financial institution may not carry back net operating losses (“NOL”) to earlier tax years. The NOL can be carried forward indefinitely. The use of NOL to offset income is limited to 80 %. The CARES Act allows NOLs generated in 2018, 2019 and 2020 to be carried back to each of the five preceding tax years. The Bank, did not generate NOLs in 2018, 2019 or 2020 so no carryback is available. At December 31, 2020, the Bank had no federal NOL carryforwards. The state and city of New York allow for a three-year carryback period and carryforward period of twenty years on net operating losses generated on or after tax year 2015. For tax years prior to 2015, no carryback period is allowed. Ponce De Leon Federal Bank, the predecessor of Ponce Bank, has pre-2015 carryforwards of $ 1.3 million for New York State purposes and $ 528,000 for New York City purposes. Furthermore, there are post-2015 carryforwards available of $ 9.1 million for New York State purposes and $ 14.3 million for New York City purposes. Finally, for New Jersey purposes, losses may only be carried forward 20 years, with no allowable carryback period. At December 31, 2020, the Bank had no New Jersey net operating loss carryforwards. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits recorded. The Company does not expect the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits to significantly increase in the next twelve months. The Company is subject to U.S. federal income tax, New York State income tax, Connecticut income tax, New Jersey income tax, Florida income tax, Pennsylvania income tax and New York City income tax. The Company is no longer subject to examination by taxing authorities for years before 2018. On March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was signed to help individuals and businesses that have been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Among other provisions, the CARES Act allows net operating losses, which were modified with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, to be carried back five years. It also modifies the useful lives of qualified leasehold improvements, relaxing the excess loss limitations on pass-through and increasing the interest expense limitation. The Company does not expect the CARES Act to have a material tax impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. 113 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 9. Income Taxes (Continued) The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at December 31, 2021 and 2020 are presented below: At December 31, 2021 2020 (in thousands) Deferred tax assets: Allowance for losses on loans $ 5,254 $ 4,846 Deferred loan fees 214 — Interest on nonaccrual loans 102 792 Unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities 399 — Amortization of intangible assets 50 70 Deferred rent payable 152 120 Depreciation of premises and equipment — 79 Net operating losses 3,280 3,990 Charitable contribution carryforward 366 1,366 Compensation and benefits 456 326 Other 264 78 Total gross deferred tax assets 10,537 11,667 Deferred tax liabilities: Depreciation of premises and equipment 1,301 — Deferred loan fees — 475 Unrealized loss on available-for-sale securities — 25 Other 63 39 Total gross deferred tax liabilities 1,364 539 Valuation allowance 5,353 6,472 Net deferred tax assets $ 3,820 $ 4,656 The deferred tax expense (benefit) has been allocated between operations and equity as follows: For the Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 (in thousands) Equity $ ( 424 ) $ 32 $ 2,186 Operations 1,260 ( 964 ) ( 2,099 ) $ 836 $ ( 932 ) $ 87 114 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 10. Compensation and Benefit Plans 401(k) Plan : Prior to January 1, 2021, the Company provides a qualified defined contribution retirement plan under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. The 401(k) Plan qualifies under the Internal Revenue Service safe harbor provisions, as defined. Employees are eligible to participate in the 401(k) Plan at the beginning of each quarter (January 1, April 1, July 1 or October 1). The 401(k) Plan provides for elective employee/participant deferrals of income. Discretionary matching, profit-sharing, and safe harbor contributions, not to exceed 4 % of employee compensation and profit-sharing contributions may be provided. The Company is currently making a safe harbor contributions of 3 %. The 401(k) expenses recorded in the consolidated statements of operations amounted to $ 375,000 , $ 580,000 and $ 331,000 for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Effective January 1, 2021, the Company amended and restated its ESOP into a KSOP, Employee Stock Ownership Plan with 401(k) provision, to include substantially the same 401(k) provisions contained in the previously separate 401(k) plan. The Company made a safe harbor contribution of 3 % into the 401(k) Plan. There were no changes to the provisions of the previously separately formed ESOP as discussed below. KSOP, Employee Stock Ownership Plan with 401(k) Provisions: In connection with the reorganization, the Company established an ESOP for the exclusive benefit of eligible employees. The ESOP borrowed $ 7.2 million from the Company, sufficient to purchase 723,751 shares (approximately 3.92 % of the common stock sold in the stock offering). The loan is secured by the shares purchased and will be repaid by the ESOP with funds from contributions made by the Company and dividends received by the ESOP. Contributions will be applied to repay interest on the loan first, and then the remainder will be applied to principal. The loan is expected to be repaid over a period of 15 years. Shares purchased with the loan proceeds are held by the trustee in a suspense account for allocation among participants as the loan is repaid. Contributions to the ESOP and shares released from the suspense account are allocated among participants in proportion to their compensation, relative to total compensation of all active participants, subject to applicable regulations. Contributions to the ESOP are to be sufficient to pay principal and interest currently due under the loan agreement. As shares are committed to be released from collateral, compensation expense equal to the average market price of the shares for the respective period are recognized, and the unallocated shares are taken into consideration when computing earnings per share. Refer to Note 11 Earnings Per Common Share for additional information. A summary of the ESOP shares as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 are as follows: December 31, 2021 December 31, 2020 (Dollars in thousands) Shares committed-to-be-released (1) 96,500 48,250 Shares allocated to participants 170,145 129,270 Unallocated shares (1) 434,251 530,751 Total 700,896 708,271 Fair value of unallocated shares $ 6,297 $ 5,578 (1) During the year, t he Company increased the shares committed-to-be-released by an additional 48,250 shares resulting in a total of 96,500 shares to be released as of December 31, 2021 compared to 48,250 shares as of December 31, 2020. The Company recognized ESOP related compensation expense, including ESOP equalization expense, of $ 1.4 million, $ 538,000 and $ 766,000 for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Included in the $1.4 million was $ 700,000 related to the additional 48,250 shares committed-to-be-released as of December 31, 2021. 115 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 10. Compensation and Benefit Plans (Continued) Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan: The Company maintains a non-qualified supplemental executive retirement plan (“SERP”) for the benefit of two key executive officers. The SERP expenses recognized were $ 261,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 for the two key executive officers. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized SERP expenses in the amount of $ 59,000 and $ 62,000 , respectively for the benefit of one key executive officer. 2018 Incentive Plan The Company’s stockholders approved the PDL Community Bancorp 2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “2018 Incentive Plan”) at the Special Meeting of Stockholders on October 30, 2018. The maximum number of shares of common stock which can be issued under the 2018 Incentive Plan is 1,248,469 . Of the 1,248,469 shares, the maximum number of shares that may be awarded under the 2018 Incentive Plan pursuant to the exercise of stock options or stock appreciation rights (“SARs”) is 891,764 shares (all of which may be granted as incentive stock options), and the number of shares of common stock that may be issued as restricted stock awards or restricted stock units is 356,705 shares. However, the 2018 Incentive Plan contains a flex feature that provides that awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units in excess of the 356,705 share limitation may be granted but each share of stock covered by such excess award shall reduce the 891,764 share limitation for awards of stock options and SARs by 3.0 shares of common stock. The Company converted 462,522 awards of stock options into 154,174 restricted stock units in 2018 and 45,000 awards of stock options into 15,000 restricted stock units in 2020. Under the 2018 Incentive Plan, the Company made grants equal to 674,645 shares on December 4, 2018 which include 119,176 incentive options to executive officers, 44,590 non-qualified options to outside directors, 322,254 restricted stock units to executive officers, 40,000 restricted stock units to non-executive officers and 148,625 restricted stock units to outside directors. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company awarded 40,000 incentive options and 15,000 restricted stock units to non-executive officers under the 2018 Incentive Plan. Awards to directors generally vest 20 % annually beginning with the first anniversary of the date of grant. Awards to a director with fewer than five years of service at the time of grant vest over a longer period and will not become fully vested until the director has completed ten years of service. Awards to the executive officer who is not a director vest 20 % annually beginning on December 4, 2020. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the maximum number of stock options and SARs remaining to be awarded under the Incentive Plan was 189,476 for both periods. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020 the maximum number of shares of common stock that may be issued as restricted stock awards or restricted stock units remaining to be awarded under the Incentive Plan was no ne for both years. If the 2018 Incentive Plan’s flex feature described above were fully utilized, the maximum number of shares of common stock that may be awarded as restricted stock awards or restricted stock units would be 63,159 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, but would eliminate the availability of stock options and SARs available for award. The product of the number of units granted and the grant date market price of the Company’s common stock determine the fair value of restricted stock units under the Company’s 2018 Incentive Plan. Management recognizes compensation expense for the fair value of restricted stock units on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award. 116 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 10. Compensation and Benefit Plans (Continued) A summary of the Company’s restricted stock units activity and related information for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are as follows: December 31, 2021 Number of Shares Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share Non-vested, beginning of year 335,919 $ 12.66 Granted — — Vested ( 98,232 ) 12.69 Forfeited — — Non-vested at December 31 237,687 $ 12.65 December 31, 2020 Number of Shares Weighted- Average Grant Date Fair Value Per Share Non-vested, beginning of year 420,744 $ 12.78 Granted 15,000 10.05 Vested ( 96,825 ) 12.77 Forfeited ( 3,000 ) 12.77 Non-vested at December 31 335,919 $ 12.66 Compensation expense related to restricted stock units for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $ 1.3 million, $ 1.3 million and $ 1.2 million, respectively.

The expected life is an estimate based on management’s review of the various factors and calculated using the simplified method for plain vanilla options. The dividend yield assumption is based on the Company’s history and expectation of dividend payouts.

Earnings Per Common Share The following table presents a reconciliation of the number of common shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per common share: For the Years Ended December 31, 2021 2020 2019 (Dollars in thousands except share data) Net Income (loss) $ 25,415 $ 3,853 $ ( 5,125 ) Common shares outstanding for basic EPS: Weighted average common shares outstanding 17,256,837 17,233,901 18,039,640 Less: Weighted average unallocated Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) shares 512,276 560,708 607,322 Basic weighted average common shares outstanding 16,744,561 16,673,193 17,432,318 Basic earnings (loss) per common share $ 1.52 $ 0.23 $ ( 0.29 ) Dilutive potential common shares: Add: Dilutive effect of share-based compensation 46,882 9,391 — Diluted weighted average common shares outstanding 16,791,443 16,682,584 17,432,318 Diluted earnings (loss) per common share $ 1.51 $ 0.23 $ ( 0.29 ) Note 12. Commitments, Contingencies and Credit Risk Financial Instruments With Off-Balance-Sheet Risk : In the normal course of business, financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk may be used to meet the financing needs of customers. These financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and letters of credit. These instruments involve, to varying degrees, elements of credit risk and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized on the consolidated statements of financial condition. The contractual amounts of these instruments reflect the extent of involvement in particular classes of financial instruments. The contractual amounts of commitments to extend credit represent the amounts of potential accounting loss should the contract be fully drawn upon, the customer default, and the value of any existing collateral become worthless. The same credit policies are used in making commitments and contractual obligations as for on-balance-sheet instruments. Financial instruments whose contractual amounts represent credit risk at December 31, 2021 and 2020 are as follows: December 31, 2021 2020 (in thousands) Commitments to grant mortgage loans $ 127,159 $ 101,722 Commitments to sell loans at lock-in rates 13,321 11,276 Unfunded commitments under lines of credit 80,033 38,261 $ 220,513 $ 151,259 Commitments to Grant Mortgage Loans : Commitments to grant mortgage loans are agreements to lend to a customer as long as all terms and conditions are met as established in the contract. Commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses, and may require payment of a fee by the borrower. Since some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon, the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Each customer's creditworthiness is evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The amount of collateral obtained, if deemed necessary upon extension of credit, is based on management's credit evaluation of the counterparty. Collateral held varies, but may include accounts receivable, inventory, property and equipment, residential real estate and income-producing commercial properties. Material losses are not anticipated as a result of these transactions. 120 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 12. Commitments, Contingencies and Credit Risk (Continued) Commitments to Sell Loans at Lock-in Rates: In order to assure itself of a marketplace to sell its loans, Mortgage World has agreements with investors who will commit to purchase loans at locked-in rates. Mortgage World has off-balance sheet market risk to the extent that Mortgage World does not obtain matching commitments from these investors to purchase the loans. This will expose Mortgage World to the lower of cost or market valuation environment. Repurchases, Indemnifications and Premium Recaptures : Loans sold by Mortgage World under investor programs are subject to repurchase or indemnification if they fail to meet the origination criteria of those programs. In addition, loans sold to investors are also subject to repurchase or indemnifications if the loan is two or three months delinquent during a set period which usually varies from six months to a year after the loan is sold. There are no open repurchase or indemnification requests for loans sold as a correspondent lender or where the Company acted as a broker in the transaction as of December 31, 2021. Unfunded Commitments Under Lines of Credit : Unfunded commitments under commercial lines of credit, revolving credit lines and overdraft protection agreements are commitments for possible future extension of credit to existing customers. These lines of credit are both uncollateralized and usually contain a specified maturity date and, ultimately, may not be drawn upon to the total extent to which the Company is committed. Letters of Credit : Letters of credit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party. These guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements. The credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers. Letters of credit are largely cash secured. Concentration by Geographic Location : Loans, commitments to extend credit and letters of credit have been granted to customers who are located primarily in New York City metropolitan area. Generally, such loans most often are secured by one-to-four family residential. The loans are expected to be repaid from the borrowers' cash flows. Loan Concentrations : As of December 31, 2021, approximately 6 .0% of Mortgage World total originated loan volume was insured and approximately 65.1 % of total originated loan volume was sold to three investors. Mortgage World is permitted to close loans in five states and has closed approximately 99.1 % of its loan volume in two states, New York and New Jersey. Lease Commitments : At December 31, 2021, there were noncancelable operating leases for office space that expire on various dates through 2038 . Certain of these leases contain an escalation clause providing for increased rental based primarily on increases in real estate taxes. On February 11, 2021, the Company completed the sale of real property located at 3821 Bergenline Avenue, Union City, New Jersey for a sale price of $ 2.4 million. Concurrent with the sale, the Bank and the purchaser entered into a fifteen-year lease agreement whereby the Bank will lease back this real property at an initial annual base rent of approximately $ 145,000 subject to annual rent increases of 1.5 %. Under the lease agreement, the Bank has four (4) consecutive options to extend the term of the lease by five (5) years for each such option. The sale lease-back resulted in a gain of approximately $ 623,000 , net of expenses, which is included in other non-interest income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. On June 4, 2021, the Company completed the sale of real property located at 5560 Broadway, Bronx, New York for a sale price of $ 5.7 million.

O n November 12, 2021 , the Company completed the sale of real property located at 169-174 Smith Street, Brooklyn , New York for a sale price of $ 4.0 million. Concurrent with the sale, the Bank and the purchaser entered into a fifteen-year lease agreement whereby the Bank will lease back this real property at an initial annual base rent of approximately $ 200,000 subject to annual rent increases of 1.50 %. The sale lease-back resulted in a gain of approximately $ 3.7 million, net of expenses, which is included in other non-interest income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. 121 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 12. Commitments, Contingencies and Credit Risk (Continued) On December 16, 2021, the Company completed the sale of real property located at 37-60 82 nd Street, Jackson Heights, New York for a sale price of $ 11.8 million. Concurrent with the sale, the Bank and the purchaser entered into a seventeen-year lease agreement whereby the Bank will lease back this real property at an initial annual base rent of approximately $ 530,000 subject to annual rent increases of 2.0 %. The sale lease-back resulted in a gain of approximately $ 3.1 million, net of expenses, which is included in other non-interest income in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Operations. Rental expenses under operating leases, included in occupancy expense, totaled $ 2.3 million, $ 1.5 million, and $ 1.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The projected minimum rental payments under the terms of the leases at December 31, 2021 are as follows: December 31, (in thousands) 2022 $ 3,591 2023 3,600 2024 3,643 2025 3,600 2026 3,422 Thereafter 32,112 $ 49,968 Legal Matters : The Company is involved in various legal proceedings which have arisen in the normal course of business. Management believes that resolution of these matters will not have a material effect on the Company’s financial condition or results of operations. 122 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 13. Fair Value The following fair value hierarchy is used based on the lowest level of input significant to the fair value measurement. There are three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair values: Level 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets that the entity has the ability to access as of the measurement date. Level 2 – Significant other observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data. Level 3 – Significant unobservable inputs that reflect a company’s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability. The Company used the following methods and significant assumptions to estimate fair value: Cash and Cash Equivalents, Placements with Banks, Accrued Interest Receivable, Advance Payments by Borrowers for Taxes and Insurance, and Accrued Interest Payable : The carrying amount is a reasonable estimate of fair value. These assets and liabilities were not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Available-for-Sale Securities : These financial instruments are recorded at fair value in the consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis. Where quoted prices are available in an active market, securities are classified within Level 1 of the valuation hierarchy. If quoted prices are not available, then fair values are estimated by using pricing models (e.g., matrix pricing) or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics and are classified within Level 2 of the valuation hierarchy. Examples of such instruments include government agency bonds and mortgage-backed securities. Level 3 securities are securities for which significant unobservable inputs are utilized. There were no changes in valuation techniques used to measure similar assets during the period. FHLBNY Stock : The carrying value of FHLBNY stock approximates fair value since the Bank can redeem such stock with FHLBNY at cost. As a member of the FHLBNY, the Company is required to purchase this stock, which we carry at cost and classified as restricted equity securities. Loans Receivable : For variable rate loans, which reprice frequently and have no significant change in credit risk, carrying values are a reasonable estimate of fair values, adjusted for credit losses inherent in the portfolios. The fair value of fixed rate loans is estimated by discounting the future cash flows using estimated market rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities, adjusted for credit losses inherent in the portfolios. Impaired loans are valued using a present value discounted cash flow method, or the fair value of the collateral. Loans are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Mortgage Loans Held for Sale : Mortgage loans held for sale, at fair value, consists primarily of mortgage loans originated for sale by Mortgage World and accounted for under the fair value option. These assets are valued using stated investor pricing for substantially equivalent loans as Level 2. In determining fair value, such measurements are derived based on observable market data, investor commitments, or broker quotations, including whole-loan transaction pricing and similar market transactions adjusted for portfolio composition, servicing value and market conditions. Loans held for sale by the Bank are carried at the lower of cost or fair value as determined by investor bid prices. Under the fair value option, management has elected, on an instrument-by-instrument basis, fair value accounting for substantially all forms of mortgage loans originated for sale on a recurring basis. The fair value carrying amount of mortgages held for sale under the fair value option was $ 15.8 million and the aggregate unpaid principal balance amounted to $ 15.5 million. Interest Rate Lock Commitments : Mortgage World enters into rate lock commitments to extend credit to borrowers for generally up to a 60 day period for origination and/or purchase of loans. To the extent that a loan is ultimately granted and the borrower ultimately accepts the terms of the loan, these loan commitments expose Mortgage World to variability in its fair value due to changes in interest rates. 123 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 13. Fair Value (Continued) The FASB determined that loan commitments related to the origination or acquisition of mortgage loans that will be held for sale must be accounted for as derivative instruments. Such commitments, along with any related fees received from potential borrowers, are recorded at fair value in derivative assets or liabilities, with changes in fair value recorded in net gain or loss on sale of mortgage loans. Fair value is based on active market pricing for substantially similar underlying mortgage loans commonly referred to as best execution pricing or investment commitment pricing, if the loan is committed to an investor through a best efforts contract. In valuing interest rate lock commitments, there are several unobservable inputs such as the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights, estimated remaining cost to originate the loans, and the pull through rate of the open pipeline. Accordingly, such derivative is classified as Level 3. The approximate notional amounts of Mortgage World’s derivative instruments was $ 13.3 million and $ 11.3 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The fair value of derivatives related to interest rate lock commitments not subject to a forward loan sale commitment, amounted to $ 172,000 and $ 166,000 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and is included in other assets on the consolidated statements of financial position. The table below presents the changes in derivatives from interest rate lock commitments that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis: (in thousands) Balance as of December 31, 2020 $ 166 Change in fair value of derivative instrument reported in earnings 6 Balance as of December 31, 2021 $ 172 Other Real Estate Owned : Other real estate owned represents real estate acquired through foreclosure, and is recorded at fair value less estimated disposal costs on a nonrecurring basis. Fair value is based upon independent market prices, appraised values of the collateral or management's estimation of the value of the collateral. When the fair value of the collateral is based on an observable market price or a current appraised value, the asset is classified as Level 2. When an appraised value is not available or management determines the fair value of the collateral is further impaired below the appraised value and there is no observable market price, the asset is classified as Level 3. Deposits : The fair values of demand deposits, savings, NOW, reciprocal deposits and money market accounts equal their carrying amounts, which represent the amounts payable on demand at the reporting date. Fair values for fixed-term, fixed-rate certificates of deposit are estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies market interest rates on certificates of deposit to a schedule of aggregated expected monthly maturities on such deposits. Deposits are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. FHLBNY Advances : The fair value of the advances is estimated using a discounted cash flow calculation that applies current market-based FHLBNY interest rates for advances of similar maturity to a schedule of maturities of such advances. These borrowings are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Warehouse Lines of Credit, Mortgage Loan Fundings Payable : The carrying amounts of warehouse lines of credit and mortgage loan fundings payable approximate fair value and due to their short-term nature are classified as Level 2. Off-Balance-Sheet Instruments : Fair values for off-balance-sheet instruments (lending commitments and letters of credit) are based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements, taking into account the remaining terms of the agreements and the counterparties' credit standing. Off-balance-sheet instruments are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. 124 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 13. Fair Value (Continued) The following tables detail the assets that are carried at fair value and measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and indicate the level within the fair value hierarchy utilized to determine the fair value: December 31, 2021 Description Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 (in thousands) Available-for-Sale Securities: U.S. Government Bonds $ 2,934 $ — $ 2,934 $ — Corporate bonds 21,184 — 21,184 — Mortgage-Backed Securities: Collateralized Mortgage Obligations 18,348 — 18,348 — FNMA Certificates 70,699 — 70,699 — GNMA Certificates 181 — 181 — Mortgage loans held for sale, at fair value 15,836 — 15,836 — Derivatives from interest rate lock commitments 172 — — 172 $ 129,354 $ — $ 129,182 $ 172 December 31, 2020 Description Total Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 (in thousands) Available-for-Sale Securities: Corporate bonds $ 10,463 $ — $ 10,463 $ — Mortgage-Backed Securities: FHLMC Certificates 3,196 — 3,196 — FNMA Certificates 3,567 — 3,567 — GNMA Certificates 272 — 272 — Mortgage Loans Held for Sale, at fair value 35,406 — 35,406 — Derivatives from interest rate lock commitments 166 — — 166 $ 53,070 $ — $ 52,904 $ 166 Management’s assessment and classification of a financial instrument within a level can change over time based upon maturity or liquidity of the investment and would be reflected at the beginning of the quarter in which the change occurred.

Fair Value (Continued) The fair value information about financial instruments are disclosed, whether or not recognized in the consolidated statements of financial condition, for which it is practicable to estimate that value. Accordingly, the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value of the Company. The estimated fair value amounts for 2021 and 2020 have been measured as of their respective period-ends and have not been reevaluated or updated for purposes of these consolidated financial statements subsequent to those respective dates. As such, the estimated fair values of these financial instruments subsequent to the respective reporting dates may be different than amounts reported at each period. The information presented should not be interpreted as an estimate of the fair value of the entire Company since a fair value calculation is only required for a limited portion of the Company's assets and liabilities. Due to the wide range of valuation techniques and the degree of subjectivity used in making the estimates, comparisons between the Company's disclosures and those of other banks may not be meaningful. Note 14. Regulatory Capital Requirements The Company, the Bank and Mortgage World are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the Federal Reserve Board, the OCC, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the NYS Department of Financial Services, respectively. Failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on the Company’s operations and financial statements. Under the regulatory capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, the Company must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the Company's assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The Company's capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Quantitative measures established by regulation require the maintenance of minimum amounts and ratios (set forth in the table below) of total risk-based and Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets (as defined), common equity Tier 1 capital (as defined), and Tier 1 capital to adjusted total assets (as defined). As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, all applicable capital adequacy requirements have been met. The below minimum capital requirements exclude the capital conservation buffer required to avoid limitations on capital distributions, including dividend payments and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers. The capital conservation buffer was phased in to 2.5 % by 2019. The applicable capital buffer was 9.23 % and 7.95 % at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The most recent notification from the OCC categorized the Bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action. To be categorized as well capitalized, the Company and the Bank must maintain minimum total risk-based, Tier 1 risk-based and Tier 1 leverage ratios as set forth in the table below. There were no conditions or events since then that management believes have changed the Bank's category. 127 Ponce Financial Group Inc. and Subsidiaries Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Note 14.

Segment Reporting The Company had two reportable segments: Ponce Bank and Mortgage World. Income from Ponce Bank consists primarily of interest earned on loans and investment securities and service charges on deposit accounts. Income from Mortgage World consisted primarily of taking of applications from the general public for residential mortgage loans, underwriting them to investors’ standards, closing and funding them and holding them until they are sold to investors.

Controls and Procedures. Evaluation of Disclosure a) Controls and Procedures An evaluation was performed under the supervision and with the participation of the Company’s management, including the President and Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) promulgated under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) as of December 31, 2021. Based on that evaluation, the Company’s management, including the President and Chief Executive Officer and the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective. b) Management’s Annual Report The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) over financial reporting. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer regarding the reliability of financial reporting and preparation of the Company’s financial statements in accordance with GAAP. In designing and evaluating the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures, the Company and its management recognize that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only a reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management was required to apply its judgment in evaluating and implementing possible controls and procedures. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation and may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. The Company’s management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based on management’s assessment, the Company believes that, as of December 31, 2021, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on the criteria established by Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO. c) Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm Not applicable because the Company is an emerging growth company. d) Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting There were no significant changes made in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of the year ended December 31, 2021 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.

Statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act are generally identified through the inclusion of words such as “aim,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “drive,” “estimate,” “expect,” “expressed confidence,” “forecast,” “future,” “goal,” “guidance,” “intend,” “may,” “objective,” “outlook,” “plan,” “position,” “potential,” “project,” “seek,” “should,” “strategy,” “target,” “will” or similar statements or variations of such words and other similar expressions. All statements addressing our future operating performance, and statements addressing events and developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act. These forward-looking statements are based on currently available information, operating plans and projections about future events and trends. They inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in any such forward-looking statement. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business – Our Business Risks.” Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The discussion of risks in this report is by no means all-inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our future performance. PART I Item 1. Business. When used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “PepsiCo” and the “Company” mean PepsiCo, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, collectively. Certain terms used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are defined in the Glossary included in Item 7. of this report. Company Overview We were incorporated in Delaware in 1919 and reincorporated in North Carolina in 1986. We are a leading global beverage and convenient food company with a complementary portfolio of brands, including Lay’s, Doritos, Cheetos, Gatorade, Pepsi-Cola, Mountain Dew, Quaker and SodaStream. Through our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a wide variety of beverages and convenient foods, serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories. Our Operations We are organized into seven reportable segments (also referred to as divisions), as follows: 1) Frito-Lay North America (FLNA), which includes our branded convenient food businesses in the United States and Canada; 2) Quaker Foods North America (QFNA), which includes our branded convenient food businesses, such as cereal, rice, pasta and other branded food, in the United States and Canada; 3) PepsiCo Beverages North America (PBNA), which includes our beverage businesses in the United States and Canada; 4) Latin America (LatAm), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Latin America; 5) Europe, which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Europe; 2 Table of Contents 6) Africa, Middle East and South Asia (AMESA), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia; and 7) Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region (APAC), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand, and China region.

PBNA also, either independently or in conjunction with third parties, makes, markets, distributes and sells ready-to-drink tea and coffee products through joint ventures with Unilever (under the Lipton brand name) and Starbucks, respectively.

Our Distribution Network Our products are primarily brought to market through DSD, customer warehouse and distributor networks and are also sold directly to consumers through e-commerce platforms and retailers. The distribution system used depends on customer needs, product characteristics and local trade practices. 4 Table of Contents Direct-Store-Delivery We, our independent bottlers and our distributors operate DSD systems that deliver beverages and convenient foods directly to retail stores where the products are merchandised by our employees or our independent bottlers. DSD enables us to merchandise with maximum visibility and appeal. DSD is especially well-suited to products that are restocked often and respond to in-store promotion and merchandising. Customer Warehouse Some of our products are delivered from our manufacturing plants and distribution centers, both company and third-party operated, to customer warehouses. These less costly systems generally work best for products that are less fragile and perishable, and have lower turnover. Distributor Networks We distribute many of our products through third-party distributors. Third-party distributors are particularly effective when greater distribution reach can be achieved by including a wide range of products on the delivery vehicles. For example, our foodservice and vending business distributes beverages and convenient foods to restaurants, businesses, schools and stadiums through third-party foodservice and vending distributors and operators. E-commerce Our products are also available and sold directly to consumers on a growing number of company-owned and third-party e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications. Ingredients and Other Supplies The principal ingredients we use in our beverage and convenient food products are aspartame, corn, corn sweeteners, flavorings, flour, juice concentrates, oats, potatoes, raw milk, rice, seasonings, sucralose, sugar, vegetable and essential oils, and wheat. We also use water in the manufacturing of our products. Our key packaging materials include plastic resins, including polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene resins used for plastic beverage bottles and film packaging used for convenient foods, aluminum, glass, closures, cardboard and paperboard cartons. In addition, we continue to integrate recyclability into our product development process and support the increased use of recycled content, including recycled PET, in our packaging. Fuel, electricity and natural gas are also important commodities for our businesses due to their use in our and our business partners’ facilities and the vehicles delivering our products. We employ specialists to secure adequate supplies of many of these items and have not experienced any significant continuous shortages that would prevent us from meeting our requirements. Many of these ingredients, raw materials and commodities are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and futures. In addition, risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. When prices increase, we may or may not pass on such increases to our customers. In addition, we continue to make investments to improve the sustainability and resources of our agricultural supply chain, including the development of our initiative to advance sustainable farming practices by our suppliers and expanding it further globally. During 2022, we continued to experience increased commodity, packaging and other input costs and, in some instances, supply constraints related to the deadly conflict in Ukraine, the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, the inflationary cost environment, adverse weather conditions, supply chain disruptions and labor shortages, which has continued into fiscal 2023. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on how we manage our exposure to commodity prices. We also maintain voluntary supply chain finance agreements with several participating global financial institutions, pursuant to which our suppliers, at their sole discretion, may elect to sell their accounts receivable with PepsiCo to such global financial institutions. These agreements did not have a material 5 Table of Contents impact on our business or financial results. See “Our Financial Results – Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for further information.

We also hold long-term licenses to use valuable trademarks in connection with our products in certain markets, including Ocean Spray. We also distribute Celsius energy drinks and various Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. brands, including Dr Pepper in certain markets, Crush and Schweppes. Joint ventures in which we have an ownership interest either own or have the right to use certain trademarks, such as Lipton, Sabra and Starbucks. In addition, in the first quarter of 2022, we sold our Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands to PAI Partners, while retaining a 39% noncontrolling interest in TBG, operating across North America and Europe. In the United States, PepsiCo acts as the exclusive distributor for TBG’s portfolio of brands for small-format and foodservice customers with chilled DSD. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. In 2022, we began to distribute Hard MTN Dew, an alcoholic beverage manufactured and owned by the Boston Beer Company. We have licensed the use of the Hard MTN Dew trademark to the Boston Beer Company, which has appointed us as their distributor for this product. Trademarks remain valid so long as they are used properly for identification purposes, and we emphasize correct use of our trademarks. We have authorized, through licensing arrangements, the use of many of our trademarks in such contexts as convenient food joint ventures and beverage bottling appointments. In addition, we license the use of our trademarks on merchandise that is sold at retail, which enhances brand awareness. We either own or have licenses to use a number of patents which relate to certain of our products, their packaging, the processes for their production and the design and operation of various equipment used in our businesses. Some of these patents are licensed to others. Seasonality Our businesses are affected by seasonal variations. Our beverage and convenient food sales are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related patterns and generally lowest in the first quarter. However, taken as a whole, seasonality has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial results. 6 Table of Contents Our Customers Our customers include wholesale and other distributors, foodservice customers, grocery stores, drug stores, convenience stores, discount/dollar stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, hard discounters, e-commerce retailers and authorized independent bottlers, among others. We normally grant our independent bottlers exclusive contracts to sell and manufacture certain beverage products bearing our trademarks within a specific geographic area. These arrangements provide us with the right to charge our independent bottlers for concentrate, finished goods and Aquafina royalties and specify the manufacturing process required for product quality. We also grant distribution rights to our independent bottlers for certain beverage products bearing our trademarks for specified geographic areas. We rely on and provide financial incentives to our customers to assist in the distribution and promotion of our products to the consumer. For our independent distributors and retailers, these incentives include volume-based rebates, product placement fees, promotions and displays. For our independent bottlers, these incentives are referred to as bottler funding and are negotiated annually with each bottler to support a variety of trade and consumer programs, such as consumer incentives, advertising support, new product support, and vending and cooler equipment placement. Consumer incentives include pricing discounts and promotions, and other promotional offers. Advertising support is directed at advertising programs and supporting independent bottler media. New product support includes targeted consumer and retailer incentives and direct marketplace support, such as point-of-purchase materials, product placement fees, media and advertising. Vending and cooler equipment placement programs support the acquisition and placement of vending machines and cooler equipment. The nature and type of programs vary annually. Changes to the retail landscape, including increased consolidation of retail ownership, the continued growth of sales through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription services and other direct-to-consumer businesses, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers, as well as the international expansion of hard discounters, and the current economic environment continue to increase the importance of major customers. In 2022, sales to Walmart Inc. (Walmart) and its affiliates, including Sam’s Club (Sam’s), represented approximately 14% of our consolidated net revenue, with sales reported across all of our divisions, including concentrate sales to our independent bottlers, which were used in finished goods sold by them to Walmart. The loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on our FLNA, QFNA and PBNA divisions. Our Competition Our beverage and convenient food products are in highly competitive categories and markets and compete against products of international beverage and convenient food companies that, like us, operate in multiple geographies, as well as regional, local and private label manufacturers and economy brands and other competitors, including smaller companies developing and selling micro brands directly to consumers through e-commerce platforms or through retailers focused on locally-sourced products. In many countries in which our products are sold, including the United States, The Coca-Cola Company is our primary beverage competitor. Other beverage and convenient food competitors include, but are not limited to, Campbell Soup Company, Conagra Brands, Inc., Hormel Foods Corporation, Kellogg Company, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., The Kraft Heinz Company, Link Snacks, Inc., Mondelēz International, Inc., Monster Beverage Corporation, Nestlé S.A., Red Bull GmbH and Utz Brands, Inc. Many of our convenient food products hold significant leadership positions in the convenient food industry in the United States and worldwide. In 2022, we and The Coca-Cola Company represented approximately 20% and 21%, respectively, of the U.S. liquid refreshment beverage category by estimated retail sales in measured channels, according to Information Resources, Inc. However, The Coca-Cola Company has significant carbonated soft drink (CSD) share advantage in many markets outside the United States. 7 Table of Contents Our beverage and convenient food products compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition and loyalty, taste, price, value, quality, product variety, innovation, distribution, advertising, marketing and promotional activity (including digital), packaging, convenience, service and the ability to anticipate and effectively respond to consumer preferences and trends, including increased consumer focus on health and wellness and sustainability and the continued acceleration of e-commerce and other methods of distributing and purchasing products. Success in this competitive environment is dependent on effective promotion of existing products, effective introduction of new products and reformulations of existing products, increased efficiency in production techniques, effective incorporation of technology and digital tools across all areas of our business, the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns, marketing programs, product packaging and pricing, new vending and dispensing equipment and brand and trademark development and protection. We believe that the strength of our brands, innovation and marketing, coupled with the quality of our products and flexibility of our distribution network, allows us to compete effectively. Research and Development We engage in a variety of research and development activities and invest in innovation globally with the goal of meeting the needs of our customers and consumers and accelerating growth. These activities principally involve: innovations focused on creating consumer preferred products to grow and transform our portfolio through development of new technologies, ingredients, flavors and substrates; development and improvement of our manufacturing processes, including reductions in cost and environmental footprint; implementing product improvements to our global portfolio that reduce added sugars, sodium or saturated fat; offering more products with functional ingredients and positive nutrition including whole grains, fruit, vegetables, dairy, protein, fiber, micronutrients and hydration; development of packaging technology and new package designs, including reducing the amount of plastic in our packaging and developing recyclable, compostable, biodegradable or otherwise sustainable packaging; development of marketing, merchandising and dispensing equipment; further expanding our beyond the bottle portfolio including innovation for our SodaStream business; investments in technology and digitalization, including artificial intelligence and data analytics to enhance our consumer insights and research; continuing to strengthen our omnichannel capabilities, particularly in e-commerce; and efforts focused on reducing our impact on the environment, including reducing water use in our operations and our agricultural practices and reducing our environmental impact in our operations throughout our value chain. Our research centers are located around the world, including in Brazil, China, India, Ireland, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States, and leverage consumer insights, food science and engineering to meet our strategy to continually innovate our portfolio of beverages and convenient foods. Regulatory Matters The conduct of our businesses, including the production, storage, distribution, sale, display, advertising, marketing, labeling, content, quality, safety, transportation, packaging, disposal, recycling and use of our products, as well as our employment and occupational health and safety practices and protection of personal information, are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States, as well as to laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies in the more than 200 other countries and territories in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. It is our policy to abide by the laws and regulations around the world that apply to our businesses. The U.S. laws and regulations that we are subject to include, but are not limited to: the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and various state laws governing food safety; the Food Safety Modernization Act; the Occupational Safety and Health Act and various state laws and regulations governing workplace health 8 Table of Contents and safety; various federal, state and local environmental protection laws, as discussed below; the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act; the Federal Trade Commission Act; the Lanham Act; various federal and state laws and regulations governing competition and trade practices, including the Robinson-Patman Act and the Clayton Act; various federal and state laws and regulations governing our employment practices, including those related to equal employment opportunity, such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Act and the National Labor Relations Act and those related to overtime compensation, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act; various state and federal laws pertaining to sale and distribution of alcohol beverages; data privacy and personal data protection laws and regulations, including the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (as modified by the California Privacy Rights Act); customs and foreign trade laws and regulations, including laws regarding the import or export of our products or ingredients used in our products and tariffs; laws regulating the sale of certain of our products in schools; laws regulating the ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products; laws regulating our supply chain, including the 2010 California Transparency in Supply Chains Act and laws relating to the payment of taxes. We are also required to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act. We are also subject to various state and local statutes and regulations, including state consumer protection laws such as Proposition 65 in California, which requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a substance listed by the State of California as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects, unless the amount of such substance in the product is below a safe harbor level. We are subject to numerous similar and other laws and regulations outside the United States, including but not limited to laws and regulations governing food safety, international trade and tariffs, supply chains, including the U.K. Modern Slavery Act, occupational health and safety, competition, anti-corruption and data privacy, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. In many jurisdictions, compliance with competition laws is of special importance to us due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions, as is compliance with anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act. We rely on legal and operational compliance programs, as well as in-house and outside counsel and other experts, to guide our businesses in complying with the laws and regulations around the world that apply to our businesses. In addition, certain jurisdictions have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or commodities used in the production of our products. These taxes vary in scope and form: some apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). Similarly, some measures apply a single tax rate per ounce/liter on beverages containing over a certain level of added sugar (or other sweetener) while others apply a graduated tax rate depending upon the amount of added sugar (or other sweetener) in the beverage and some apply a flat tax rate on beverages containing a particular substance or ingredient, regardless of the level of such substance or ingredient. In addition, certain jurisdictions have either imposed, or are considering imposing, product labeling or warning requirements or other limitations on the marketing or sale of certain of our products as a result of ingredients or substances contained in such products or the audience to whom products are marketed. These types of provisions have required that we highlight perceived concerns about a product, warn consumers to avoid consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in our products, restrict the age of consumers to whom products are marketed or sold or limit the location in which our products may be available. It is possible that similar or more restrictive requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future. In addition, certain jurisdictions have either imposed or are considering imposing regulations designed to increase recycling rates, encourage waste reduction or to restrict the sale of products utilizing certain packaging. These regulations vary in scope and form from deposit return systems designed to incentivize 9 Table of Contents the return of beverage containers, to extended producer responsibility policies and even restrictions or bans on the use of certain types of packaging, including single-use plastics and packaging containing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). It is possible that similar or more restrictive requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future. We are also subject to national and local environmental laws in the United States and in foreign countries in which we do business, including laws related to water consumption and treatment, wastewater discharge and air emissions. In the United States, we are subject to the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding handling, storage, release and disposal of wastes generated onsite and sent to third-party owned and operated offsite licensed facilities. Our operations outside the United States are subject to similar laws and regulations. In addition, continuing concern over environmental, social and governance matters, including climate change, is expected to continue to result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements (in or outside of the United States) to reduce emissions to mitigate the potential effects of greenhouse gases, to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity concerns or to expand mandatory reporting of certain environmental, social and governance metrics. Our policy is to abide by all applicable environmental laws and regulations, and we have internal programs in place with respect to our global environmental compliance. We have made, and plan to continue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and to achieve our sustainability goals. While these expenditures have not had a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations to date, changes in environmental compliance requirements, and expenditures necessary to comply with such requirements or to achieve our sustainability goals, could adversely affect our financial performance. In addition, we and our subsidiaries are subject to environmental remediation obligations arising in the normal course of business, as well as remediation and related indemnification obligations in connection with certain historical activities and contractual obligations, including those of businesses or properties acquired by us or our subsidiaries. While these environmental remediation and indemnification obligations cannot be predicted with certainty, such obligations have not had, and are not expected to have, a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. In addition to the discussion in this section, see also “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Human Capital PepsiCo believes that human capital management, including attracting, developing and retaining a high quality workforce, is critical to our long-term success. Our Board of Directors (Board) and its Committees provide oversight on a broad range of human capital management topics, including corporate culture, diversity, equity and inclusion, pay equity, health and safety, training and development and compensation and benefits. We employed approximately 315,000 people worldwide as of December 31, 2022, including approximately 132,000 people within the United States. We are party to numerous collective bargaining agreements and believe that relations with our employees are generally good. Protecting the safety, health, and well-being of our associates around the world is PepsiCo’s top priority. We strive to achieve an injury-free work environment. We also continue to invest in emerging technologies to protect our employees from injuries, including leveraging fleet telematics and distracted driving technology, resulting in reductions in road traffic incidents, and deploying ergonomic and machine safety risk reduction solutions. In addition, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have remained focused on the health and safety of our associates, especially our frontline associates who continue to make, move and sell our products during this critical time, including by continuing to implement various safety protocols in our facilities, providing personal protective equipment and enabling testing. We are 10 Table of Contents also focused on the safety of our associates in Ukraine and have provided humanitarian aid, goods and services to support our people and communities facing the ongoing deadly conflict. We believe that our culture of diversity, equity and inclusion is a competitive advantage that fuels innovation, enhances our ability to attract and retain talent and strengthens our reputation. We continually strive to improve the attraction, retention, and advancement of diverse associates to ensure we sustain a high-caliber pipeline of talent that also represents the communities we serve. As of December 31, 2022, our global workforce was approximately 27% female, while management roles were approximately 44% female. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 48% of our U.S. workforce was comprised of racially/ethnically diverse individuals, of which approximately 33% of our U.S. associates in managerial roles were racially/ethnically diverse individuals. The Board has overseen appointments of current direct reports of our Chief Executive Officer, who include 7 executives globally who are racially/ethnically diverse and/or female. We are also committed to the continued growth and development of our associates. PepsiCo supports and develops its associates through a variety of global training and development programs that build and strengthen employees' leadership and professional skills, including career development plans, mentoring programs and in-house learning opportunities, such as PEP U Degreed, our internal global online learning resource. In 2022, PepsiCo employees completed over 1 million hours of training.

The information on our website is not, and shall not be deemed to be, a part hereof or incorporated into this or any of our other filings with the SEC. Item 1A. Risk Factors. The following risks, some of which have occurred and any of which may occur in the future, can have a material adverse effect on our business or financial performance, which in turn can affect the price of our publicly traded securities. These are not the only risks we face. There may be other risks we are not currently aware of or that we currently deem not to be material but that may become material in the future. 11 Table of Contents Business Risks Risks associated with the deadly conflict in Ukraine The deadly conflict in Ukraine has continued to result in worldwide geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty and certain of our operations in Ukraine remain suspended. The conflict has resulted and could continue to result in volatile commodity markets, supply chain disruptions, increased risk of cyber incidents or other disruptions to our information systems, reputational risk, heightened risks to employee safety, business disruptions (including labor shortages), significant volatility of the Russian ruble, limitations on access to credit markets and other corporate banking services, including working capital facilities, reduced availability and increased costs for transportation, energy, packaging and raw materials and other input costs, environmental, health and safety risks related to securing and maintaining facilities, additional sanctions, export controls and other legislation or regulations (including restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from Russia). The ongoing conflict could result in the temporary or permanent loss of assets or result in additional impairment charges. We cannot predict how and the extent to which the conflict will continue to affect our employees, operations, customers, consumers or business partners or our ability to achieve certain of our sustainability goals. The conflict has adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect demand for our products and our global business. Reduction in future demand for our products would adversely affect our business. Demand for our products depends in part on our ability to innovate and anticipate and effectively respond to shifts in consumer trends and preferences, including the types of products our consumers want and how they browse for, purchase and consume them. Consumer preferences continuously evolve due to a variety of factors, including: changes in consumer demographics, consumption patterns and channel preferences (including continued increases in the e-commerce and online-to-offline channels); pricing; product quality; concerns or perceptions regarding packaging and its environmental impact (such as single-use and other plastic packaging); and concerns or perceptions regarding the nutrition profile and health effects of, or location of origin of, ingredients or substances in our products or packaging, including due to the results of third-party studies (whether or not scientifically valid). Concerns with any of the foregoing could lead consumers to reduce or publicly boycott the purchase or consumption of our products. Pandemics, epidemics or other disease outbreaks, such as COVID-19, have also impacted and could continue to impact consumer preferences and demand for our products. Consumer preferences are also influenced by perception of our brand image or the brand images of our products, the success of our advertising and marketing campaigns, our ability to engage with our consumers in the manner they prefer, including through the use of digital media or assets, and the perception of our use, the use of social media and our response to political and social issues or catastrophic events. These and other factors have reduced in the past and could continue to reduce consumers’ willingness to purchase certain of our products. Any inability on our part to anticipate or react to changes in consumer preferences and trends, or make the right strategic investments to do so, including investments in data analytics to understand consumer trends, can lead to reduced demand for our products, lead to inventory write-offs or erode our competitive and financial position, thereby adversely affecting our business. In addition, our business operations, including our supply chain, are subject to disruption by natural disasters, pandemics, epidemics or other events beyond our control that could negatively impact product availability and decrease demand for our products if our crisis management plans do not effectively mitigate these issues. Damage to our reputation or brand image can adversely affect our business. Maintaining a positive reputation globally is critical to selling our products. Our reputation or brand image has in the past been, and could in the future be, adversely impacted by a variety of factors, including: any failure by us or our business partners to maintain high ethical, business and environmental, social and governance practices, including with respect to human rights, child labor laws, diversity, equity and 12 Table of Contents inclusion, workplace conditions and employee health and safety; any failure, or perception of a failure, to achieve our environmental, social and governance goals, including with respect to the nutrition profile of our products, diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, packaging, water use and our impact on the environment; any failure to address health or other concerns about our products, products we distribute (including alcoholic beverages), or particular ingredients in our products, including concerns regarding whether certain of our products contribute to obesity or an increase in public health costs; our research and development efforts; any product quality or safety issues, including the recall of any of our products; any failure to comply with laws and regulations; consumer perception of our advertising campaigns, sponsorship arrangements, marketing programs, use of social media and our response to political and social issues or catastrophic events; or any failure to effectively respond to negative or inaccurate comments about us on social media or otherwise regarding any of the foregoing. Damage to our reputation or brand image has in the past and could in the future decrease demand for our products, thereby adversely affecting our business. Product recalls or other issues or concerns with respect to product quality and safety can adversely affect our business. We have and could in the future recall products due to product quality or safety issues, including actual or alleged mislabeling, misbranding, spoilage, undeclared allergens, adulteration or contamination. Joint ventures in which we have an interest have also recalled, and could in the future recall, products for the same or other reasons. Product recalls have in the past and could in the future adversely affect our business by resulting in losses due to their cost, the destruction of product inventory or lost sales due to any unavailability of the product for a period of time. In addition, product quality or safety issues, whether as a result of failure to comply with food safety laws or otherwise, have in the past and could in the future also reduce consumer confidence and demand for our products, cause production and delivery disruptions, and result in increased costs (including payment of fines and/or judgments) and damage our reputation (or the reputation of joint ventures in which we have an interest), particularly as we or our joint ventures continue to expand into new categories, such as the distribution of alcoholic beverages, all of which can adversely affect our business. Failure to maintain adequate oversight over product quality or safety can result in product recalls, litigation, government investigations or inquiries or civil or criminal proceedings, all of which may result in fines, penalties, damages or criminal liability. Our business can also be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in product quality, safety and integrity generally, even if such loss of confidence is unrelated to products in our portfolio. Any inability to compete effectively can adversely affect our business. Our products compete against products of international beverage and convenient food companies that, like us, operate in multiple geographies, as well as regional, local and private label and economy brand manufacturers and other competitors, including smaller companies developing and selling micro brands directly to consumers through e-commerce platforms or through retailers focused on locally sourced products. In many countries in which our products are sold, including the United States, The Coca-Cola Company is our primary beverage competitor. Our products compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition and loyalty, taste, price, value, quality, product variety, innovation, distribution, advertising, marketing and promotional activity, packaging, convenience, service and the ability to anticipate and effectively respond to consumer preferences and trends. Our business can be adversely affected if we are unable to effectively promote or develop our existing products or introduce and effectively market new products, if we are unable to effectively adopt new technologies, including artificial intelligence and data analytics to develop new commercial insights and improve operating efficiencies, if we are unable to continuously strengthen and evolve our capabilities in digital marketing, if our competitors spend more aggressively than we do or if we are otherwise unable to effectively respond to supply disruptions, pricing pressure (including as a result of commodity inflation) or otherwise compete effectively, and we may be 13 Table of Contents unable to grow or maintain sales or category share or we may need to increase capital, marketing or other expenditures. Failure to attract, develop and maintain a highly skilled and diverse workforce or effectively manage changes in our workforce can have an adverse effect on our business. Our business requires that we attract, develop and maintain a highly skilled and diverse workforce. Our employees are highly sought after by our competitors and other companies and our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract, retain, develop and motivate highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Our ability to do so has been and may continue to be impacted by challenges in the labor market, which has experienced and may continue to experience wage inflation, labor shortages, increased employee turnover, changes in availability of our workforce and a shift toward remote work. Any unplanned turnover, sustained labor shortage or unsuccessful implementation of our succession plans to backfill current leadership positions, including the Chief Executive Officer, or failure to attract, develop and maintain a highly skilled and diverse workforce, including with key capabilities such as e-commerce and digital marketing and data analytic skills, can deplete our institutional knowledge base, erode our competitive advantage or result in increased costs due to increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs. In addition, failure to attract, retain and develop associates from underrepresented communities can damage our business results and our reputation. Any of the foregoing can adversely affect our business. Water scarcity can adversely affect our business. We and our business partners use water in the manufacturing of our products. Water is also essential to the production of the raw materials needed in our manufacturing process. Lack of available water of acceptable quality, actions by governmental and non-governmental organizations, investors, customers and consumers on water scarcity and increasing pressure to conserve and replenish water in areas of scarcity and stress, including due to the effects of climate change, can lead to: supply chain disruption; adverse effects on our operations or the operations of our business partners; higher compliance costs; increased capital expenditures (including investments in the development of technologies to enhance water efficiency and reduce consumption); higher production costs, including less favorable pricing for water; the interruption or cessation of operations at, or relocation of, our facilities or the facilities of our business partners; failure to achieve our goals relating to water use; perception of our failure to act responsibly with respect to water use or to effectively respond to legal or regulatory requirements concerning water scarcity; or damage to our reputation, any of which can adversely affect our business. Changes in the retail landscape or in sales to any key customer can adversely affect our business. The retail landscape continues to evolve, including continued growth in e-commerce channels and hard discounters. Our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain and develop successful relationships with e-commerce retailers and hard discounters, while also maintaining relationships with our key customers operating in traditional retail channels (many of whom are also focused on increasing their e-commerce sales). Our business can be adversely affected if e-commerce channels and hard discounters take significant additional market share away from traditional retailers or we fail to find ways to create increasingly better digital tools and capabilities for our retail customers to enable them to grow their businesses. In addition, our business can be adversely affected if we are unable to profitably expand our own direct-to-consumer e-commerce capabilities. The retail industry is also impacted by increased consolidation of ownership and purchasing power, particularly in North America, Europe and Latin America, resulting in large retailers or buying groups with increased purchasing power, impacting our ability to compete in these areas. Consolidation also adversely impacts our smaller customers’ ability to compete effectively, resulting in an inability on their part to pay for our products or reduced or canceled orders of our products. Further, we must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key 14 Table of Contents customers, including Walmart, to compete effectively. Any inability to resolve a significant dispute with any of our key customers, a change in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of any of our key customers, even if unrelated to us, a significant reduction in sales to any key customer, or the loss of any of our key customers can adversely affect our business. Disruption of our manufacturing operations or supply chain, including continued increased commodity, packaging, transportation, labor and other input costs, can adversely affect our business. We have experienced and could continue to experience disruption in our manufacturing operations and supply chain. Many of the raw materials and supplies used in the production of our products are sourced from countries experiencing civil unrest, political instability or unfavorable economic conditions. Some raw materials and supplies, including packaging materials, are available only from a limited number of suppliers or from a sole supplier or are in short supply when seasonal demand is at its peak. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain favorable arrangements and relationships with suppliers or that our contingency plans will be effective to mitigate disruptions that may arise from shortages or discontinuation of any raw materials and other supplies that we use in the manufacture, production and distribution of our products or from operational or financial instability of our key suppliers. Any sustained or significant disruption in the future to the manufacturing or sourcing of products or materials could increase our costs and interrupt product supply, which can adversely impact our business. The raw materials and other supplies, including agricultural commodities, fuel and packaging materials, such as recycled PET, transportation, labor and other supply chain inputs that we use for the manufacturing, production and distribution of our products are subject to price volatility and fluctuations in availability caused by many factors, including changes in supply and demand, supplier capacity constraints, inflation, weather conditions (including potential effects of climate change), fire, natural disasters, disease or pests (including the impact of greening disease on the citrus industry), agricultural uncertainty, health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks (including COVID-19), labor shortages or changes in availability of our or our business partners’ workforce (including the lack of availability of truck drivers or as a result of COVID-19), strikes or work stoppages (including by railway workers or other third parties involved in the manufacture, production and distribution of our products), governmental incentives and controls (including import/export restrictions, such as new or increased tariffs, sanctions, quotas or trade barriers), port congestions or delays, transport capacity constraints, cybersecurity incidents or other disruptions, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, political uncertainties, acts of terrorism, governmental instability or currency exchange rates. Many of our raw materials and supplies are purchased in the open market and the prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation. We experienced higher than anticipated commodity, packaging and transportation costs during 2022, which may continue. When input prices increase unexpectedly or significantly, we may be unwilling or unable to increase our product prices or unable to effectively hedge against price increases to offset these increased costs without suffering reduced volume, revenue, margins and operating results. Political and social conditions can adversely affect our business. Political and social conditions in the markets in which our products are sold have been and could continue to be difficult to predict, resulting in adverse effects on our business. The results of elections, referendums or other political conditions (including government shutdowns or hostilities between countries) in these markets have in the past and could continue to impact how existing laws, regulations and government programs or policies are implemented or result in uncertainty as to how such laws, regulations, programs or policies may change, including with respect to tariffs, sanctions, environmental and climate change regulations, taxes, benefit programs, the movement of goods, services and people between countries, relationships between countries, customer or consumer perception of a particular country or its government and other matters, and has resulted in and could continue to result in exchange rate fluctuation, volatility in global stock markets and global economic uncertainty or adversely affect demand 15 Table of Contents for our products, any of which can adversely affect our business. In addition, political and social conditions in certain cities throughout the U.S. as well as globally have resulted in demonstrations and protests, including in connection with political elections and civil rights and liberties. Our operations or the operations of our business partners, including the distribution of our products and the ingredients or other raw materials used in the production of our products, may be disrupted if such events persist for a prolonged period of time, including due to actions taken by governmental authorities in affected cities and regions, which can adversely affect our business. Our business can be adversely affected if we are unable to grow in developing and emerging markets. Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business in developing and emerging markets, including Mexico, the Middle East, China, South Africa, Brazil and India. There can be no assurance that our products will be accepted or be successful in any particular developing or emerging market, due to competition, price, cultural differences, consumer preferences, method of distribution or otherwise. Our business in these markets has been and could continue in the future to be impacted by economic, political and social conditions; acts of war, terrorist acts, and civil unrest, including demonstrations and protests; competition; tariffs, sanctions or other regulations restricting contact with certain countries in these markets; foreign ownership restrictions; nationalization of our assets or the assets of our business partners; government-mandated closure, or threatened closure, of our operations or the operations of our business partners; restrictions on the import or export of our products or ingredients or substances used in our products; highly inflationary economies; devaluation or fluctuation or demonetization of currency; regulations on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, currency controls or other currency exchange restrictions, which result in significant cash balances in foreign countries, from time to time, or can significantly affect our ability to effectively manage our operations in certain of these markets and can result in the deconsolidation of such businesses; the lack of well-established or reliable legal systems; increased costs of doing business due to compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act; and adverse consequences, such as the assessment of fines or penalties, for any failure to comply with laws and regulations. Our business can be adversely affected if we are unable to expand our business in developing and emerging markets, effectively operate, or manage the risks associated with operating, in these markets, or achieve the return on capital we expect from our investments in these markets. Changes in economic conditions can adversely impact our business. Many of the jurisdictions in which our products are sold have experienced and could continue to experience uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions, such as high inflation and adverse changes in interest rates, tax laws or tax rates, which could result in recessions or economic slowdowns; volatile commodity markets; labor shortages; highly inflationary economies, devaluation, fluctuation or demonetization of currency; contraction in the availability of credit; austerity or stimulus measures; the effects of any default by or deterioration in the creditworthiness of the countries in which our products are sold; or a decrease in the fair value of pension or post-retirement assets that could increase future employee benefit costs and/or funding requirements of our pension or post-retirement plans. In addition, we cannot predict how current or future economic conditions will affect our business partners, including financial institutions with whom we do business, and any negative impact on any of the foregoing may also have an adverse impact on our business. Future cyber incidents and other disruptions to our information systems can adversely affect our business. We depend on information systems and technology, including public websites and cloud-based services, for many activities important to our business, including communications within our company, interfacing 16 Table of Contents with customers and consumers; ordering and managing inventory; managing and operating our facilities; protecting confidential information, including personal data we collect; maintaining accurate financial records and complying with regulatory, financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. Our business has in the past and could in the future be negatively affected by system shutdowns, degraded systems performance, systems disruptions or security incidents. These disruptions or incidents may be caused by cyberattacks and other cyber incidents, network or power outages, software, equipment or telecommunications failures, the unintentional or malicious actions of employees or contractors, natural disasters, fires or other catastrophic events. In addition, the increase in certain of our employees working remotely has resulted in increased demand on our information technology infrastructure, which can be subject to failure, disruption or unavailability, and increased vulnerability to cyberattacks and other cyber incidents. Cyberattacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently, the techniques used to gain access to information technology systems and data, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and becoming more sophisticated in nature and are being carried out by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives. Cyberattacks and cyber incidents may be difficult to detect for periods of time and take many forms including cyber extortion, denial of service, social engineering, introduction of viruses or malware (such as ransomware), exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware, software or other infrastructure, hacking, website defacement or theft of passwords and other credentials, unauthorized use of computing resources for digital currency mining and business email compromise. As with other global companies, we are regularly subject to cyberattacks and other cyber incidents, including the types of attacks and incidents described above. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to continue building and maintaining our information technology infrastructure, or if we fail to timely identify or appropriately respond to cyberattacks or other cyber incidents, our business has been and can continue to be adversely affected, which has resulted in and can continue to result in some or all of the following: transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, inability to access our data or systems, lost revenues or other costs resulting from disruptions or shutdowns of offices, plants, warehouses, distribution centers or other facilities, intellectual property or other data loss, litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations, fines or penalties, remediation costs, damage to our reputation or a negative impact on employee morale and the loss of current or potential customers. In addition, these risks also exist in acquired businesses, joint ventures or companies we invest in or partner with that use separate information systems or that have not yet been fully integrated into our information systems. Similar risks exist with respect to our business partners and third-party providers, including suppliers, software and cloud-based service providers, that we rely upon for aspects of our information technology support services and administrative functions, including payroll processing, health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions, and the systems managed, hosted, provided and/or used by such third parties and their vendors. For example, malicious actors have employed and could continue to employ the information technology supply chain to introduce malware through software updates or compromised supplier accounts or hardware. The need to coordinate with various third-party service providers, including with respect to timely notification and access to personnel and information concerning an incident, may complicate our efforts to address issues that arise. As a result, we are subject to the risk that the activities associated with our third-party service providers can adversely affect our business even if the attack or breach does not directly impact our systems or information. Although the cyber incidents and other systems disruptions that we have experienced to date have not had a material effect on our business, such incidents or disruptions could have a material adverse effect on us in the future. While we devote significant resources to network security, disaster recovery, employee training and other measures to secure our information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of data, there are no guarantees that they will be adequate to safeguard against all cyber incidents, systems disruptions, system compromises or misuses of data. In addition, while we currently 17 Table of Contents maintain insurance coverage that, subject to its terms and conditions, is intended to address costs associated with certain aspects of cyber incidents and information systems failures, this insurance coverage may not, depending on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding an incident, cover all losses or all types of claims that arise from an incident, or the damage to our reputation or brands that may result from an incident. Failure to successfully complete or manage strategic transactions can adversely affect our business. We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and evaluate potential acquisitions, joint ventures, distribution agreements, divestitures, refranchisings and other strategic transactions. The success of these transactions is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to realize the full extent of the expected returns, benefits, cost savings or synergies as a result of a transaction, within the anticipated time frame, or at all; and receipt of necessary consents, clearances and approvals. Risks associated with strategic transactions include integrating manufacturing, distribution, sales, accounting, financial reporting and administrative support activities and information technology systems with our company or difficulties separating such personnel, activities and systems in connection with divestitures; operating through new business models or in new categories or territories; motivating, recruiting and retaining executives and key employees; conforming controls (including internal control over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures and data protection and cybersecurity) and policies (including with respect to environmental compliance, health and safety compliance and compliance with anti-bribery laws); retaining existing customers and consumers and attracting new customers and consumers; managing tax costs or inefficiencies; maintaining good relations with divested or refranchised businesses in our supply or sales chain; inability to offset loss of revenue associated with divested brands or businesses; managing the impact of business decisions or other actions or omissions of our joint venture partners that may have different interests than we do; and other unanticipated problems or liabilities, such as contingent liabilities and litigation. Strategic transactions that are not successfully completed or managed effectively, or our failure to effectively manage the risks associated with such transactions, have in the past and could continue to result in adverse effects on our business. Our reliance on third-party service providers and enterprise-wide systems can have an adverse effect on our business. We rely on third-party service providers, including cloud data service providers, for certain areas of our business, including payroll processing, health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions. Failure by these third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory and other obligations to us, or our failure to adequately monitor their performance, has in the past and could continue to result in our inability to achieve the expected cost savings or efficiencies and result in additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers. Depending on the function involved, such errors can also lead to business disruption, systems performance degradation, processing inefficiencies or other systems disruptions, the loss of or damage to intellectual property or sensitive data through security breaches or otherwise, incorrect or adverse effects on financial reporting, litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations, fines or penalties, remediation costs, damage to our reputation or have a negative impact on employee morale, all of which can adversely affect our business. In addition, we continue on our multi-year phased business transformation initiative to migrate certain of our systems, including our financial processing systems, to enterprise-wide systems solutions and have begun to roll out these systems in certain countries and divisions. We have experienced and could continue to experience systems outages and operating inefficiencies following these planned implementations. In addition, if we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper information technology infrastructure, or if we fail to achieve the expected benefits from this initiative, our business could be adversely affected. 18 Table of Contents Climate change or measures to address climate change can negatively affect our business or damage our reputation. Climate change may increase the frequency or severity of natural disasters and other extreme weather conditions (including rising temperatures and drought), which could pose physical risks to our facilities, impair our production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products. Climate change may also have a negative effect on agricultural production resulting in decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as potatoes, sugar cane, corn, wheat, rice, oats, oranges and other commodities. Also, there is an increased focus in many jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold regarding environmental policies relating to climate change, regulating greenhouse gas emissions, energy policies and sustainability, including single-use plastics. This increased focus may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements, such as potential carbon pricing programs or revised product labeling requirements or other regulatory measures, which could, along with initiatives to meet our sustainability goals, continue to result in significant increased costs and require additional investments in facilities and equipment. As a result, the effects of climate change can negatively affect our business and operations. In addition, any failure to achieve or properly report on our goals with respect to reducing our impact on the environment or perception of a failure to act responsibly with respect to the environment or to effectively respond to regulatory requirements concerning climate change can lead to adverse publicity, which could result in reduced demand for our products, damage to our reputation or increase the risk of litigation. Any of the foregoing can adversely affect our business. Strikes or work stoppages can cause our business to suffer. Many of our employees and employees of third parties that are involved in the manufacturing, production or distribution of our products are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and other employees may seek to be covered by collective bargaining agreements. Strikes or work stoppages or other business interruptions have occurred and may occur in the future if we or the third parties that are involved in the manufacturing, production and distribution of our products are unable to renew, or enter into new, collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms and can impair manufacturing and distribution of our products, interrupt product supply, lead to a loss of sales, increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully implement future operational changes to enhance our efficiency or to adapt to changing business needs or strategy, all of which can adversely affect our business. Financial Risks Failure to realize benefits from our productivity initiatives can adversely affect our financial performance. Our future growth depends, in part, on our ability to continue to reduce costs and improve efficiencies, including our multi-year phased implementation of shared business service organizational models. We continue to identify and implement productivity initiatives that we believe will position our business for long-term sustainable growth by allowing us to achieve a lower cost structure, improve decision-making and operate more efficiently. Some of these measures result in unintended consequences, such as business disruptions, distraction of management and employees, reduced morale and productivity, unexpected employee attrition, an inability to attract or retain key personnel and negative publicity. If we are unable to successfully implement our productivity initiatives as planned or do not achieve expected savings as a result of these initiatives, we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits, resulting in adverse effects on our financial performance. A deterioration in our estimates and underlying assumptions regarding the future performance of our business can result in an impairment charge that can adversely affect our results of operations. We conduct impairment tests on our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. In addition, amortizable 19 Table of Contents intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. A deterioration in our underlying assumptions regarding the impact of competitive operating conditions, macroeconomic conditions, including the interest rate environment, or other factors used to estimate the future performance of any of our reporting units or assets, including any deterioration in the weighted-average cost of capital based on market data available at the time, have resulted and could in the future result in an impairment charge, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations. Fluctuations in exchange rates impact our financial performance. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the United States, where the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar, are translated into U.S. dollars. Given our global operations, we also pay for the ingredients, raw materials and commodities used in our business in numerous currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates, including as a result of inflation, central bank monetary policies, currency controls or other currency exchange restrictions have had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on our financial performance. Our borrowing costs and access to capital and credit markets can be adversely affected by a downgrade or potential downgrade of our credit ratings. Rating agencies routinely evaluate us and their ratings are based on a number of factors, including our cash generating capability, levels of indebtedness, policies with respect to shareholder distributions and our financial strength generally, as well as factors beyond our control, such as the state of the economy and our industry. We expect to maintain Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global credit markets at favorable interest rates. Any downgrade or announcement that we are under review for a potential downgrade of our credit ratings, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, can increase our future borrowing costs, impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all, result in a reduction in our liquidity, or impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically (and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing), all of which can adversely affect our financial performance. Legal, Tax and Regulatory Risks Taxes aimed at our products can adversely affect our business or financial performance. Certain jurisdictions in which our products are sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes on the manufacture, distribution or sale of certain of our products, particularly our beverages, as a result of ingredients contained in our products. These taxes vary in scope and form: some apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). Similarly, some measures apply a single tax rate per ounce/liter on beverages containing over a certain amount of added sugar (or other sweetener), some apply a graduated tax rate depending upon the amount of added sugar (or other sweetener) in the beverage and others apply a flat tax rate on beverages containing any amount of added sugar (or other sweetener). For example, Italy enacted a flat tax on all beverages, including zero calorie beverages, effective January 1, 2023, at a rate of EUR 10 cent (0.11 U.S. dollars) per liter . These tax measures, whatever their scope or form, have in the past and could continue to increase the cost of certain of our products, reduce overall consumption of our products or lead to negative publicity, resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial performance. 20 Table of Contents Limitations on the marketing or sale of our products can adversely affect our business and financial performance. Certain jurisdictions in which our products are sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, limitations on the marketing or sale of our products as a result of ingredients or substances in our products. These limitations require that we highlight perceived concerns about a product, warn consumers to avoid consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in our products, restrict the age of consumers to whom products are marketed or sold or limit the location in which our products may be available. For example, Brazil and Canada enacted warning labeling requirements in 2022 to indicate whether a particular pre-packaged food or beverage product is considered to be high in sugar, sodium or saturated fat. Certain jurisdictions have imposed or are considering imposing color-coded labeling requirements where colors such as red, yellow and green are used to indicate various levels of a particular ingredient, such as sugar, sodium or saturated fat, in products. The imposition or proposed imposition of additional limitations on the marketing or sale of our products has in the past and could continue to reduce overall consumption of our products, lead to negative publicity or leave consumers with the perception that our products do not meet their health and wellness needs, resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial performance. Laws and regulations related to the use or disposal of plastics or other packaging materials can adversely affect our business and financial performance. We rely on diverse packaging solutions to safely deliver products to our customers and consumers. Certain of our products are sold in packaging designed to be recyclable, commercially compostable, biodegradable or reusable. However, not all packaging is recovered, whether due to lack of infrastructure or otherwise, and certain of our packaging is not currently recyclable, commercially compostable, biodegradable or reusable. Packaging waste not properly disposed of that displays one or more of our brands has in the past resulted in and could continue to result in negative publicity, litigation, government action or reduced consumer demand for our products, adversely affecting our financial performance. Many jurisdictions in which our products are sold have imposed or are considering imposing laws, regulations or policies intended to encourage the use of sustainable packaging, waste reduction or increased recycling rates or to restrict the sale of products utilizing certain packaging. These laws, regulations and policies vary in form and scope and include extended producer responsibility policies, plastic or packaging taxes, restrictions on certain products and materials, requirements for bottle caps to be tethered to bottles, restrictions or bans on the use of certain types of packaging, including single-use plastics and packaging containing PFAS, restrictions on labeling related to recyclability and requirements to charge deposit fees. For example, the European Union, Peru and certain states in the United States, among other jurisdictions, have imposed a minimum recycled content requirement for beverage bottle packaging and similar legislation is under consideration in other jurisdictions. These laws and regulations have in the past and could continue to increase the cost of our products, impact demand for our products, result in negative publicity and require us and our business partners, including our independent bottlers, to increase capital expenditures to invest in reducing the amount of virgin plastic or other materials used in our packaging, to develop alternative packaging or to revise product labeling, all of which can adversely affect our business and financial performance. Failure to comply with personal data protection and privacy laws can adversely affect our business. We are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions regarding personal data protection and privacy laws. These laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country or, within the United States, from state to state, and can create inconsistent or conflicting requirements. Our efforts to comply with these laws and regulations, including the California Consumer Privacy Act, which was significantly modified by the California Privacy Rights Act, as well as new comprehensive privacy legislation passed in Virginia, Colorado, Utah and Connecticut, as well as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation and China's Personal Information Protection Act, impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to 21 Table of Contents continue to increase over time, particularly as additional jurisdictions continue to adopt similar regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations or to otherwise protect personal data from unauthorized access, use or other processing, have in the past and could in the future result in litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations, damage to our reputation, fines or penalties, all of which can adversely affect our business. Increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or disagreements with tax authorities can adversely affect our financial performance. Increases in income tax rates or other changes in tax laws, including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, can adversely affect our financial performance. For example, economic and political conditions in countries where we are subject to taxes, including the United States, have in the past and could continue to result in significant changes in tax legislation or regulation. For example, numerous countries have agreed to a statement in support of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development model rules that propose a partial global profit reallocation and a global minimum tax rate of 15% and European Union member states have recently agreed to implement the global minimum tax. There can be no assurance that other individual countries will adopt these changes, or that once adopted by any country, that these changes will not have adverse effects on our financial performance. This increasingly complex global tax environment has in the past and could continue to increase tax uncertainty, resulting in higher compliance costs and adverse effects on our financial performance. We are also subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by numerous taxing authorities with respect to income and non-income based taxes. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in jurisdictions in which we operate, or the adoption of new or reformed tax legislation or regulation, has made and could continue to make resolving tax disputes more difficult and the final resolution of tax audits and any related litigation can differ from our historical provisions and accruals, resulting in an adverse effect on our financial performance. If we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, or if we are found to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, our business can be adversely affected. We possess intellectual property rights that are important to our business, including ingredient formulas, trademarks, copyrights, patents, business processes and other trade secrets. The laws of various jurisdictions in which we operate have differing levels of protection of intellectual property. Our competitive position and the value of our products and brands can be reduced and our business adversely affected if we fail to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property, including our ingredient formulas, or if there is a change in law that limits or removes the current legal protections afforded our intellectual property. Also, in the course of developing new products or improving the quality of existing products, we have in the past been alleged to have infringed, and could in the future infringe or be alleged to infringe, on the intellectual property rights of others. Such infringement or allegations of infringement could result in expensive litigation and damages, damage to our reputation, disruption to our operations, injunctions against development, manufacturing, use and/or sale of certain products, inventory write-offs or other limitations on our ability to introduce new products or improve the quality of existing products, resulting in an adverse effect on our business. Failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our business can adversely affect our business. The conduct of our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the production, storage, distribution, sale, display, advertising, marketing, labeling, content (including whether a product contains genetically engineered ingredients), quality, safety, transportation, traceability, sourcing (including pesticide use), packaging, disposal, recycling and use of our products or raw materials, employment and occupational health and safety, environmental, social and governance matters and reporting (including climate change) and data privacy and protection. In addition, in many jurisdictions, 22 Table of Contents compliance with competition and antitrust laws is of special importance to us due to our competitive position, as is compliance with anti-corruption laws. The imposition of new laws, changes in laws or regulatory requirements or changing interpretations thereof, changes in the enforcement priorities of regulators, and differing or competing regulations and standards across the markets where our products or raw materials are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, have in the past and could continue to result in higher compliance costs, capital expenditures and higher production costs, or make it necessary for us to reformulate certain of our products, resulting in adverse effects on our business. For example, increasing governmental and societal attention to environmental, social and governance matters has resulted and could continue to result in new laws or regulatory requirements, including expanded disclosure requirements that are expected to continue to expand the nature, scope and complexity of matters on which we are required to report. In addition, the entry into new markets or categories, including our recent entry into the alcoholic beverage industry as a distributor, has resulted in and could continue to result in our business being subject to additional regulations resulting in higher compliance costs. If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new laws or regulations that impact the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products, other jurisdictions may follow. Failure to comply with such laws or regulations (or allegations thereof) can subject us to criminal or civil investigations or enforcement actions, including voluntary and involuntary document requests, fines, injunctions, product recalls, penalties, disgorgement of profits or activity restrictions, all of which can adversely affect our business. In addition, the results of third-party studies (whether or not scientifically valid) purporting to assess the health implications of consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in certain of our products or packaging materials have resulted in and could continue to result in our being subject to new taxes and regulations or lawsuits that can adversely affect our business. Potential liabilities and costs from litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations can have an adverse impact on our business. We and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations, including but not limited to matters related to our advertising, marketing or commercial practices, product labels, claims and ingredients, personal injury and property damage, intellectual property rights, privacy, employment, tax and insurance matters, environmental, social and governance matters and matters relating to our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. These matters are inherently uncertain and there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves or that our assessment of the materiality of these matters and the likely outcome or potential losses and established reserves will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such matters. Responding to these matters, even those that are ultimately non-meritorious, requires us to incur significant expense and devote significant resources, and may generate adverse publicity that damages our reputation or brand image. Any of the foregoing can adversely affect our business. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. We have received no written comments regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff of the SEC that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of our 2022 year and that remain unresolved. 23 Table of Contents Item 2. Properties. Our principal executive office located in Purchase, New York and our facilities located in Plano, Texas, all of which we own, are our most significant corporate properties. In connection with making, marketing, distributing and selling our products, each division utilizes manufacturing, processing, bottling and production plants, warehouses, distribution centers, storage facilities, offices, including division headquarters, research and development facilities and other facilities, all of which are either owned or leased. Significant properties by division are as follows: Property Type Location Owned/ Leased FLNA Research and development facility Plano, Texas Owned QFNA Convenient food plant Cedar Rapids, Iowa Owned PBNA Research and development facility Valhalla, New York Owned PBNA Concentrate plant Arlington, Texas Owned LatAm Convenient food plant Celaya, Mexico Owned LatAm Two convenient food plants Vallejo, Mexico Owned Europe Convenient food plant Leicester, United Kingdom Leased Europe Convenient food plant Kashira, Russia Owned Europe Manufacturing plant Lehavim, Israel Owned Europe Dairy plant Moscow, Russia Owned (a) AMESA Convenient food plant Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Owned (a) APAC Convenient food plant Wuhan, China Owned (a) FLNA, QFNA, PBNA Shared service center Winston Salem, North Carolina Leased PBNA, LatAm Concentrate plant Colonia, Uruguay Owned (a) PBNA, Europe, AMESA Two concentrate plants Cork, Ireland Owned PBNA, AMESA, APAC Concentrate plant Singapore Owned (a) All divisions Shared service center Hyderabad, India Leased (a) The land on which these properties are located is leased. Most of our plants are owned or leased on a long-term basis. In addition to company-owned or leased properties described above, we also utilize a highly distributed network of plants, warehouses and distribution centers that are owned or leased by our contract manufacturers, co-packers, strategic alliances or joint ventures in which we have an equity interest. We believe that our properties generally are in good operating condition and, taken as a whole, are suitable, adequate and of sufficient capacity for our current operations. Item 3. Legal Proceedings. We and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations. While the results of such litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the final outcome of the foregoing will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. See also “Item 1. Business – Regulatory Matters” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. Not applicable. 24 Table of Contents Information About Our Executive Officers The following is a list of names, ages and backgrounds of our current executive officers: Name Age Title David J.

OUR BUSINESS Executive Overview PepsiCo is a leading global beverage and convenient food company with a complementary portfolio of brands, including Lay’s, Doritos, Cheetos, Gatorade, Pepsi-Cola, Mountain Dew, Quaker and SodaStream. Through our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a wide variety of beverages and convenient foods, serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories. As a global company with deep local ties, we faced many of the same challenges in 2022 as our consumers, customers, and competitors across the world, including supply chain disruptions; inflationary pressures; shifting consumer preferences and behaviors; another year of the COVID-19 pandemic; a worsening climate crisis; a highly competitive operating environment; a rapidly changing retail landscape, including the growth in e-commerce; continued macroeconomic and political volatility, including the deadly conflict in Ukraine; and an evolving regulatory landscape. To meet the challenges of today – and those of tomorrow – we are driven by an approach called pep+ (PepsiCo Positive). pep+ is a strategic end-to-end transformation of our business, with sustainability and human capital at the center of how the company will strive to create growth and value by operating within planetary boundaries and inspiring positive change for the planet and people. pep+ guides how we are working to transform our business operations, from sourcing ingredients and making and selling products in a more sustainable way, to leveraging our more than one billion connections with consumers each day to take sustainability mainstream and engage people to make choices that are better for themselves and the planet. pep+ drives action and progress across three key pillars, bringing together a number of industry-leading 2030 sustainability goals under a comprehensive framework: • Positive Agriculture : We are working to spread regenerative practices to restore the earth across seven million acres of land, an area approximately equal to our entire agricultural footprint, sustainably source key crops and ingredients, and improve the livelihoods of more people in our agricultural supply chain. In 2022, we elevated a number of external strategic partnerships and key engagements with this focus, including a partnership with Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM) to scale regenerative agriculture across our shared supply chains, up to 2 million acres; a research agreement with MIT to develop a more precise measurement of the greenhouse gas impact of regenerative agriculture practices; a strategic engagement with Corteva focused on agriculture sustainability, new substrates, and affordability in food corn and vegetable oils; and a joint effort with a start-up called N-Drip to scale advantaged micro irrigation technology that can provide water-saving, crop-enhancing benefits to farmers around the world. 30 Table of Contents • Positive Value Chain : We are working to build a circular and inclusive value chain through actions to: achieve net-zero emissions by 2040; become net water positive by 2030; and introduce more sustainable packaging into the value chain. Our packaging goals include cutting virgin plastic per serving, using more recycled content in our plastic packaging, and scaling our SodaStream business globally, potentially eliminating the need for more than 200 billion plastic bottles by 2030. In 2022, we also announced a new global packaging goal intended to double the percentage of all beverage servings delivered through reusable models from 10% to 20% by 2030. Additionally, we are making progress on our diversity, equity and inclusion journey around the world. And we continue to empower each one of our approximately 315,000 employees to make a positive impact in their communities through our global workforce volunteering program, One Smile at a Time. • Positive Choices : We continue working to evolve our portfolio of convenient food & beverage products so that they are better for the planet and people, including by incorporating more diverse ingredients in both new and existing products, prioritizing chickpeas, plant-based proteins and whole grains; expanding our position in the nuts & seeds category; accelerating our reduction of added sugars and sodium through the use of science-based targets across our portfolio; and offering more products with healthier oils. We are also continuing to scale new business models that require little or no single-use packaging, including the iconic SodaStream, already sold in more than 45 countries, and the new SodaStream Professional platform, allowing users to personalize their choices in reusable containers at home or on the go. We believe these priorities will position our Company for long-term sustainable growth. See also “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further information about risks and uncertainties that the Company faces. Our Operations See “Item 1. Business” for information on our divisions and a description of our distribution network, ingredients and other supplies, brands and intellectual property rights, seasonality, customers, competition, research and development, regulatory matters and human capital. In addition, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for financial information about our divisions and geographic areas. Other Relationships Certain members of our Board also serve on the boards of certain vendors and customers. These Board members do not participate in our vendor selection and negotiations nor in our customer negotiations. Our transactions with these vendors and customers are in the normal course of business and are consistent with terms negotiated with other vendors and customers. In addition, certain of our employees serve on the boards of Pepsi Bottling Ventures LLC and other affiliated companies of PepsiCo and do not receive incremental compensation for such services. Our Business Risks Risks Associated with Commodities and Our Supply Chain During 2022, we continued to experience significantly higher operating costs, including on transportation, labor and commodity (including energy) costs, which we expect to continue in 2023. Many of the commodities used in the production and transportation of our products are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and futures. A number of external factors, including the deadly conflict in Ukraine, the COVID-19 pandemic, the inflationary cost environment, adverse weather conditions, supply chain disruptions 31 Table of Contents (including raw material shortages) and labor shortages, have impacted and may continue to impact transportation, labor and commodity availability and costs. When prices increase, we may or may not pass on such increases to our customers without suffering reduced volume, revenue, margins and operating results. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on how we manage our exposure to commodity prices. Risks Associated with Climate Change Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the potential effects of climate change, including regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and potential carbon pricing programs. These new or increased legal or regulatory requirements, along with initiatives to meet our sustainability goals, could result in significant increased costs and additional investments in facilities and equipment. However, we are unable to predict the scope, nature and timing of any new or increased environmental laws and regulations and therefore cannot predict the ultimate impact of such laws and regulations on our business or financial results. We continue to monitor existing and proposed laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such laws or regulations. Risks Associated with International Operations We are subject to risks in the normal course of business that are inherent to international operations. During the periods presented in this report, certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, including in certain developing and emerging markets, operated in a challenging environment, experiencing unstable economic, political and social conditions, civil unrest, natural disasters, debt and credit issues and currency controls or fluctuations. We continue to monitor the economic, operating and political environment in these markets closely, including risks of additional impairments or write-offs, and to identify actions to potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results. See Notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of impairment charges recognized in the year ended December 31, 2022 . Risks Associated with the Deadly Conflict in Ukraine In addition to the risks associated with international operations discussed above, we continue to face risks associated with the deadly conflict in Ukraine. The conflict has continued to result in worldwide geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty, and certain of our operations in Ukraine remain suspended. We have suspended sales to our customers of Pepsi-Cola and certain of our other global beverage brands, our discretionary capital investments and advertising and promotional activities in Russia, which has negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact our business. We continue to offer our other products in Russia. Our operations in Russia accounted for 5% and 4% of our consolidated net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, respectively. Russia accounted for 4% and 5% of our consolidated assets, including 9% and 1% of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents, and 32% and 35% of our accumulated currency translation adjustment loss as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, respectively. Our operations in Ukraine accounted for 0.2% and 0.5% of our consolidated net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, respectively. Ukraine accounted for 0.1% and 0.3% of our consolidated assets as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, respectively. 32 Table of Contents The conflict has resulted and could continue to result in volatile commodity markets, supply chain disruptions, increased risk of cyber incidents or other disruptions to our information systems, reputational risks, heightened risks to employee safety, business disruptions (including labor shortages), significant volatility of the Russian ruble, limitations on access to credit markets and other corporate banking services, including working capital facilities, reduced availability and increased costs for transportation, energy, packaging, raw materials and other input costs, environmental, health and safety risks related to securing and maintaining facilities, additional sanctions, export controls and other legislation or regulations (including restrictions on the transfer of funds to and from Russia). The ongoing conflict could result in the temporary or permanent loss of assets or additional impairment charges. We cannot predict how and the extent to which the conflict will continue to affect our employees, customers, operations or business partners or our ability to achieve certain of our sustainability goals. The conflict has adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect demand for our products and our global business. See Notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Russia-Ukraine conflict charges, including i mpairment charges, recognized in the year ended December 31, 2022 . The extent of the impact of these tragic events on our business remains uncertain and will continue to depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict, including the duration and scope of the conflic t, regional instability and ongoing and additional financial and economic sanctions, export controls and other legislation imposed by governments. We will continue to monitor and assess the situation as circumstances evolve and to identify actions to potentially m itigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results. Imposition of Taxes and Regulations on our Products Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes or regulations on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products or their packaging, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or their packaging, commodities used in the production of our products or their packaging or the recyclability or recoverability of our packaging. These taxes and regulations vary in scope and form. For example, some taxes apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). Further, some regulations apply to all products using certain types of packaging (e.g., plastic), while others are designed to increase the sustainability of packaging, encourage waste reduction and increased recycling rates or facilitate the waste management process or restrict the sale of products in certain packaging. We sell a wide variety of beverages and convenient foods in more than 200 countries and territories and the profile of the products we sell, the amount of revenue attributable to such products and the type of packaging used vary by jurisdiction. Because of this, we cannot predict the scope or form potential taxes, regulations or other limitations on our products or their packaging may take, and therefore cannot predict the impact of such taxes, regulations or limitations on our financial results. In addition, taxes, regulations and limitations may impact us and our competitors differently. We continue to monitor existing and proposed taxes and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such taxes, regulations or limitations, including advocating alternative measures with respect to the imposition, form and scope of any such taxes, regulations or limitations. Retail Landscape Our industry continues to be affected by disruption of the retail landscape, including the continued growth in sales through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription services, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers and the international expansion of hard discounters. We have seen and expect to continue to see a further shift to e-commerce, online-to- 33 Table of Contents offline and other online purchasing by consumers, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to monitor changes in the retail landscape and seek to identify actions we may take to build our global e-commerce and digital capabilities, such as expanding our direct-to-consumer business, and distribute our products effectively through all existing and emerging channels of trade and potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results. See also “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Executive Overview” above and “Market Risks” below for more information about these risks and the actions we have taken to address key challenges. Risk Management Framework The achievement of our strategic and operating objectives involves risks, many of which evolve over time. To identify, assess, prioritize, address, manage, monitor and communicate these risks across the Company’s operations and foster a corporate culture of integrity and risk awareness, we leverage an integrated risk management framework. This framework includes the following: • PepsiCo’s Board has oversight responsibility for PepsiCo’s integrated risk management framework. One of the Board’s primary responsibilities is overseeing and interacting with senior management with respect to key aspects of the Company’s business, including risk assessment and risk mitigation of the Company’s top risks. Throughout the year, the Board and relevant Committees of the Board receive updates from management with respect to various enterprise risk management issues and dedicate a portion of their meetings to reviewing and discussing specific risk topics in greater detail, including risks related to cybersecurity, food safety, sustainability, human capital management (including diversity, equity and inclusion) and supply chain and commodity inflation. The Board receives and provides feedback on regular updates from management regarding the Company’s top risks, including updates from members of management responsible for overseeing impacted areas (for example, the Global Chief Information Officer and Chief Information Security Officer), governance processes associated with managing these risks, the status of projects to strengthen the Company’s risk mitigation efforts and recent incidents impacting the industry and threat landscape. Given that cybersecurity risks can impact various areas of responsibility of the Committees of the Board, the Board believes it is useful and effective for the full Board to maintain direct oversight over cybersecurity matters. In evaluating top risks, the Board and management consider short-, medium- and long-term potential impacts on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations, including looking at the internal and external environment when evaluating risks, risk amplifiers and emerging trends, and considers the risk horizon as part of prioritizing the Company’s risk mitigation efforts. The Board receives updates through presentations, memos and other written materials, teleconferences and other appropriate means of communication, with numerous opportunities for discussion and feedback, and continuously evaluates its approach in addressing top risks as circumstances evolve. For example, as part of risk updates to the Board and relevant Committees during 2022, the Board or its relevant Committee were provided updates on the impact of disruptive events, such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict, COVID-19 and supply chain disruption and commodity inflation. The Board also receives periodic updates from external experts and advisers on global macroeconomic trends and conditions that may impact the Company’s strategy and financial performance, including geopolitical conflicts, economic instability, labor market trends, changing consumer behavior, retail disruption and digitalization. The Board has tasked designated Committees of the Board with oversight of certain categories of risk management, and the Committees report to the Board regularly on these matters. ◦ The Audit Committee of the Board reviews and assesses the guidelines and policies governing PepsiCo’s risk management and oversight processes, and assists the Board’s 34 Table of Contents oversight of financial, compliance and employee safety risks facing PepsiCo. The Audit Committee also assists the Board’s oversight of the Company’s compliance with legal and regulatory requirements and the Chief Compliance & Ethics Officer, who reports to the General Counsel, meets regularly with the Audit Committee, including in executive session without management present; ◦ The Compensation Committee of the Board reviews PepsiCo’s employee compensation policies and practices to assess whether such policies and practices could lead to unnecessary risk-taking behavior; ◦ The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee assists the Board in its oversight of the Company’s governance structure and other corporate governance matters, including succession planning; and ◦ The Sustainability, Diversity and Public Policy Committee of the Board assists the Board in its oversight of PepsiCo’s policies, programs and related risks that concern key sustainability (including climate change), diversity, equity and inclusion, and public policy matters. • The PepsiCo Risk Committee (PRC) meets regularly to identify, assess, prioritize and address top strategic, financial, operating, compliance, safety, reputational and other risks. The PRC is also responsible for reporting progress on our risk mitigation efforts to the Board. The PRC is comprised of a cross-functional, geographically diverse, senior management group, including PepsiCo’s Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel, Sector Chief Executive Officers and the heads of Corporate Affairs, Human Resources, Research & Development, Information Technology, Sustainability, Strategy, Transformation, International Beverages, Commercial, Global Operations, Marketing and Financial Planning & Analysis; • Division and key market risk committees, comprised of cross-functional senior management teams, meet regularly to identify, assess, prioritize and address division and country-specific business risks; • PepsiCo’s Risk Management Office, which manages the overall risk management process, provides ongoing guidance, tools and analytical support to the PRC and the division and key country risk committees, identifies and assesses potential risks and facilitates ongoing communication between the parties, as well as with PepsiCo’s Board, the Audit Committee of the Board and other Committees of the Board; • PepsiCo’s Internal Audit Department evaluates the ongoing effectiveness of our key internal controls through periodic audit and review procedures; and • PepsiCo’s Compliance & Ethics and Law Departments lead and coordinate our compliance policies and practices. • PepsiCo’s Disclosure Committee, comprised of the General Counsel, Controller and heads of Internal Audit, Financial Planning & Analysis and Investor Relations, evaluates information from PepsiCo’s integrated risk management framework as part of the Disclosure Committee’s monitoring of the integrity and effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. PepsiCo’s risk oversight processes and disclosure controls and procedures are designed to appropriately escalate key risks to the Board as well as to analyze potential risks for disclosure. 35 Table of Contents Market Risks We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in: • commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy; • foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and • interest rates. In the normal course of business, we manage commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of strategies, including productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs and hedging. Ongoing productivity initiatives involve the identification and effective implementation of meaningful cost-saving opportunities or efficiencies, including the use of derivatives. Our global purchasing programs include fixed-price contracts and purchase orders and pricing agreements. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion of our market risks. The fair value of our derivatives fluctuates based on market rates and prices. The sensitivity of our derivatives to these market fluctuations is discussed below. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these derivatives and our hedging policies. The fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets is impacted by changes in market conditions, including interest rates and inflationary, deflationary and recessionary conditions. See “Our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” for a discussion of the exposure of our goodwill and other intangible assets and pension and retiree medical plan assets and liabilities to risks related to market fluctuations. Inflationary, deflationary and recessionary conditions impacting these market risks also impact the demand for and pricing of our products. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion. Commodity Prices Our commodity derivatives had a total notional value of $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2022 and $1.6 billion as of December 25, 2021. At the end of 2022, the potential change in fair value of commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10% decrease in the underlying commodity price, would have decreased our net unrealized gains in 2022 by $176 million, which would generally be offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases. Foreign Exchange Our operations outside of the United States generated 43% of our consolidated net revenue in 2022, with Mexico, Russia, Canada, China, the United Kingdom and South Africa, collectively, comprising approximately 23% of our consolidated net revenue in 2022. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risks in the international markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. Additionally, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency purchases, foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. During 2022, unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net revenue growth by 3 percentage points, primarily due to declines in the Turkish lira, euro, Egyptian pound, British pound sterling and South African rand, partially offset by an appreciation of the Russian ruble. Currency declines against the U.S. dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our future financial results. In addition, volatile economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, including in Argentina, Brazil, China, Mexico, the Middle East, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine, and currency controls or fluctuations in certain of these international markets, continue to, and the threat or imposition of new or increased tariffs or sanctions or other impositions in or related to these international markets may, result in challenging operating environments. 36 Table of Contents Our foreign currency derivatives had a total notional value of $3.0 billion as of December 31, 2022 and $2.8 billion as of December 25, 2021. At the end of 2022, we estimate that an unfavorable 10% change in the underlying exchange rates would have decreased our net unrealized gains in 2022 by $298 million, which would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the fair value of the underlying exposure. The total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was $2.9 billion as of December 31, 2022 and $2.1 billion as of December 25, 2021. Interest Rates Our interest rate derivatives had a total notional value of $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2022 and $2.1 billion as of December 25, 2021. Assuming year-end 2022 investment levels and variable rate debt, a 1-percentage-point increase in interest rates would have decreased our net interest expense in 2022 by $48 million due to higher cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments levels, as compared with our variable rate debt. OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS Results of Operations — Consolidated Review Volume Physical or unit volume is one of the key metrics management uses internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan and the evaluation of our business performance. We believe volume provides additional information to facilitate the comparison of our historical operating performance and underlying trends, and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. Beginning in 2022, unit volume growth adjusts for the impacts of acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes. Further, our fiscal 2022 results include an additional week (53 rd reporting week). Unit volume growth excludes the impact of the 53 rd reporting week. Beverage volume includes volume of concentrate sold to independent bottlers and volume of finished products bearing company-owned or licensed trademarks and allied brand products and joint venture trademarks sold by company-owned bottling operations. Beverage volume also includes volume of finished products bearing company-owned or licensed trademarks sold by our noncontrolled affiliates. Concentrate volume sold to independent bottlers is reported in concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE), whereas finished beverage product volume is reported in bottler case sales (BCS). Both CSE and BCS convert all beverage volume to an 8-ounce-case metric. Typically, CSE and BCS are not equal in any given period due to seasonality, timing of product launches, product mix, bottler inventory practices and other factors. While our net revenue is not entirely based on BCS volume due to the independent bottlers in our supply chain, we believe that BCS is a better measure of the consumption of our beverage products. PBNA, LatAm, Europe, AMESA and APAC, either independently or in conjunction with third parties, make, market, distribute and sell ready-to-drink tea products through a joint venture with Unilever (under the Lipton brand name), and PBNA, either independently or in conjunction with third parties, makes, markets, distributes and sells ready-to-drink coffee products through a joint venture with Starbucks. Convenient food volume includes volume sold by us and our noncontrolled affiliates of convenient food products bearing company-owned or licensed trademarks. Internationally, we measure convenient food product volume in kilograms, while in North America we measure convenient food product volume in pounds. FLNA makes, markets, distributes and sells Sabra refrigerated dips and spreads through a joint venture with Strauss Group. 37 Table of Contents Consolidated Net Revenue and Operating Profit 2022 2021 Change Net revenue $ 86,392 $ 79,474 9 % Operating profit $ 11,512 $ 11,162 3 % Operating margin 13.3 % 14.0 % (0.7) See “Results of Operations – Division Review” for a tabular presentation and discussion of key drivers of net revenue. Operating profit grew 3% while operating margin declined 0.7 percentage points. Operating profit growth was primarily driven by net revenue growth and productivity savings, partially offset by certain operating cost increases and a 42-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs. The loss of net revenue due to the Juice Transaction reduced operating profit growth by 3 percentage points and was partially offset by a 1-percentage-point contribution from the 53 rd reporting week. Operating profit growth also reflects a 13-percentage-point unfavorable impact of impairment charges related to certain indefinite-lived intangible assets due to an increase in the weighted-average cost of capital as well as our most current estimates of future financial performance (other impairment charges), a 12-percentage-point unfavorable impact of the charges associated with the Russia-Ukraine conflict and a 6-percentage-point unfavorable impact of impairment on intangible assets, investment and property, plant and equipment and other charges as a result of management’s decision to reposition or discontinue the sale/distribution of certain brands and to sell an investment (brand portfolio impairment charges). These impacts were partially offset by a 29-percentage-point contribution from the gain associated with the Juice Transaction. The operating margin decline primarily reflects the unfavorable impacts of other impairment charges, the charges associated with the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the brand portfolio impairment charges, partially offset by the gain associated with the Juice Transaction. Juice Transaction In the first quarter of 2022, we sold our Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands to PAI Partners, while retaining a 39% noncontrolling interest in TBG, operating across North America and Europe. These juice businesses delivered approximately $3 billion in net revenue in 2021. In the United States, PepsiCo acts as the exclusive distributor for TBG’s portfolio of brands for small-format and foodservice customers with chilled DSD. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Other Consolidated Results 2022 2021 Change Other pension and retiree medical benefits income $ 132 $ 522 $ (390) Net interest expense and other $ (939) $ (1,863) $ 924 Annual tax rate 16.1 % 21.8 % Net income attributable to PepsiCo $ 8,910 $ 7,618 17 % Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted $ 6.42 $ 5.49 17 % Other pension and retiree medical benefits income decreased $390 million, primarily due to higher settlement losses compared to the prior year. Net interest expense and other decreased $924 million, reflecting the prior-year charge of $842 million related to our cash tender offers, higher interest rates on average cash balances and lower average debt balances, partially offset by losses on the market value of investments used to economically hedge a portion of our deferred compensation liability and higher interest rates on debt. 38 Table of Contents The reported tax rate decreased 5.7 percentage points, primarily reflecting the impact of the Juice Transaction and adjustments to reserves for uncertain tax positions as a result of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audit. Results of Operations — Division Review See “Our Business Risks,” “Non-GAAP Measures” and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a discussion of items to consider when evaluating our results and related information regarding measures not in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). In the discussions of net revenue and operating profit below, “effective net pricing” reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries. Additionally, “acquisitions and divestitures” reflect mergers and acquisitions activity, as well as divestitures and other structural changes, including changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees. Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth Organic revenue growth is a non-GAAP financial measure.

In certain instances, the impact of organic volume growth on net revenue growth differs from the unit volume growth disclosed in the following divisional discussions due to the impacts of product mix, nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our franchise-owned beverage businesses, temporary timing differences between BCS and CSE. We report net revenue from our franchise-owned beverage businesses based on CSE. The volume sold by our nonconsolidated joint ventures has no direct impact on our net revenue. 39 Table of Contents Operating Profit/(Loss), Operating Profit/(Loss) Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability and Operating Profit/(Loss) Performance Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability on a Constant Currency Basis Operating profit/(loss) adjusted for items affecting comparability and operating profit/(loss) performance adjusted for items affecting comparability on a constant currency basis are both non-GAAP financial measures.

FLNA Net revenue grew 19%, primarily driven by effective net pricing and a 2-percentage-point contribution from the 53 rd reporting week. Unit volume decreased 1%, primarily reflecting a double-digit decline in our Sabra joint venture products and a low-single-digit decline in variety packs, partially offset by low-single-digit growth in trademark Doritos and double-digit growth in trademark Popcorners. Operating profit increased 9%, primarily reflecting the effective net pricing and productivity savings. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, including strategic initiatives, a 17-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily cooking oil, potatoes and seasoning, and higher advertising and marketing expenses. Additionally, impairment charges associated with a baked fruit convenient food brand reduced operating profit growth by 1.5 percentage points (other impairment charges). The 53 rd reporting week contributed 2 percentage points to operating profit growth. QFNA Net revenue grew 15%, primarily driven by effective net pricing and a 2-percentage-point contribution from the 53 rd reporting week, partially offset by a decrease in organic volume. Unit volume declined 3%, primarily reflecting mid-single-digit declines in oatmeal and ready-to-eat cereals and a high-single-digit decline in pancake syrups and mixes, partially offset by mid-single-digit growth in rice/pasta sides and low-single-digit growth in bars. Operating profit grew 4.5%, primarily reflecting the effective net pricing and productivity savings. These impacts were partially offset by a 37-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily grains and packaging materials, certain operating cost increases, including incremental transportation costs, the decrease in organic volume and higher advertising and marketing expenses. The 53 rd reporting week contributed 2 percentage points to operating profit growth. 41 Table of Contents PBNA Net revenue increased 4%, primarily driven by effective net pricing and an increase in organic volume. The 53 rd reporting week contributed 2 percentage points to net revenue growth offset by a 9-percentage-point unfavorable impact of lower net revenue due to the Juice Transaction. Unit volume grew slightly, driven by a 1% increase in our NCB volume, offset by a 1% decrease in CSD volume. The NCB volume increase primarily reflected a mid-single-digit increase in Gatorade sports drinks, partially offset by a double-digit decrease in our energy portfolio. Operating profit increased 122%, primarily reflecting a 124-percentage-point impact of the gain of $3.0 billion associated with the Juice Transaction, partially offset by a 2-percentage-point impact of related transaction costs. Operating profit growth was also driven by the net revenue growth and productivity savings, partially offset by certain operating cost increases, including incremental transportation and information technology costs, and a 42-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily aluminum and resin. A current-year gain associated with the sale of an asset and the 53 rd reporting week contributed 6 percentage points and 2 percentage points, respectively, to operating profit growth. Additionally, operating profit growth was reduced by a 15-percentage-point impact of the lower net revenue due to the Juice Transaction. As a result of our decision to terminate the agreement with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to distribute Bang energy drin ks, we recorded impairment and other related charges which reduced operating profit growth by 7 percentage points (brand portfolio impairment charges). LatAm Net revenue increased 21%, primarily reflecting effective net pricing and organic volume growth. Convenient foods unit volume grew 3.5%, primarily reflecting mid-single-digit growth in Mexico, partially offset by a low-single-digit decline in Brazil. Beverage unit volume grew 6%, primarily reflecting double-digit growth in Argentina. Additionally, Brazil, Guatemala, Chile and Mexico each experienced mid-single-digit growth. Operating profit increased 19%, primarily reflecting the net revenue growth, productivity savings and a 3-percentage-point favorable impact of lower charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, a 41-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily cooking oil, packaging materials and grains, and higher advertising and marketing expenses. Additionally, impairment and other charges associated with the sale of certain non-strategic brands reduced operating profit growth by 4.5 percentage points (brand portfolio impairment charges). Europe Net revenue decreased 2%, reflecting a 9-percentage-point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange, an organic volume decline and a 4.5-percentage-point unfavorable impact of the Juice Transaction, partially offset by effective net pricing. Convenient foods unit volume declined 4%, primarily reflecting double-digit declines in Russia and Ukraine and a mid-single-digit decline in Poland, partially offset by low-single-digit growth in the United Kingdom and France and mid-single-digit growth in Turkey. Additionally, the Netherlands experienced a low-single-digit decline. Beverage unit volume declined 7%, primarily reflecting double-digit declines in Russia, Ukraine and Germany, partially offset by low-single-digit growth in France.

Operating profit performance was also negatively impacted by a 91-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily packaging materials, raw milk and potatoes, certain operating cost increases, the organic volume decline, a 4-percentage-point impact of less favorable settlements of promotional spending accruals compared to the prior year and a 4-percentage-point impact of payments to employees for a change in pension benefits. These impacts were partially offset by the effective net pricing, productivity savings and lower advertising and marketing expenses. Unfavorable foreign exchange negatively impacted operating profit performance by 7 percentage points. AMESA Net revenue increased 6%, primarily reflecting effective net pricing and organic volume growth, partially offset by a 3-percentage-point unfavorable impact of an extra month of net revenue in 2021 as we aligned Pioneer Food Group Ltd.’s (Pioneer Foods) reporting calendar with that of our AMESA division. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net revenue growth by 12 percentage points. Convenient foods unit volume grew 2%, primarily reflecting double-digit growth in the Middle East and Pakistan and high-single-digit growth in India, partially offset by a low-single-digit decline in South Africa. Beverage unit volume grew 14%, primarily reflecting double-digit growth in India. Additionally, the Middle East experienced high-single-digit growth, Nigeria experienced low-single-digit growth and Pakistan experienced double-digit growth.

APAC Net revenue increased 4%, primarily reflecting effective net pricing and organic volume growth, partially offset by a 2-percentage-point unfavorable impact of an extra month of net revenue in 2021 as we aligned Hangzhou Haomusi Food Co., Ltd.’s (Be & Cheery) reporting calendar with that of our APAC division. Unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net revenue growth by 5 percentage points. Convenient foods unit volume grew 3%, primarily reflecting low-single-digit growth in China and Australia and mid-single-digit growth in Thailand, partially offset by a low-single-digit decline in Taiwan. Beverage unit volume grew 8%, primarily reflecting double-digit growth in Vietnam. Additionally, China experienced mid-single-digit growth, Thailand experienced low-single-digit growth and the Philippines experienced high-single-digit growth. Operating profit decreased 20%, primarily reflecting a 25-percentage-point impact of impairment charges related to the Be & Cheery brand (other impairment charges). Operating profit performance was also 43 Table of Contents negatively impacted by a 25-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily cooking oil and potatoes, certain operating cost increases and higher advertising and marketing expenses, partially offset by the net revenue growth and productivity savings. Additionally, prior-year impairment charges associated with an equity method investment positively contributed 3 percentage points to operating profit performance. Unfavorable foreign exchange negatively impacted operating profit performance by 4 percentage points. Non-GAAP Measures Certain financial measures contained in this Form 10-K adjust for the impact of specified items and are not in accordance with GAAP. We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures in this Form 10-K allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends. We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring plans; charges associated with mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes; gains associated with divestitures; asset impairment charges (non-cash); pension and retiree medical-related amounts (including all settlement and curtailment gains and losses); charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; and remeasurements of net monetary assets. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2021, certain immaterial pension and retiree medical-related settlement and curtailment gains and losses were not considered items affecting comparability. Pension and retiree medical-related service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and other net periodic pension costs continue to be reflected in our core results. See below and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a description of adjustments to our GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K. Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. The following non-GAAP financial measures contained in this Form 10-K are discussed below: Cost of sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, gain associated with the Juice Transaction, impairment of intangible assets, other pension and retiree medical benefits income, net interest expense and other, provision for income taxes, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and net income attributable to PepsiCo, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, operating profit and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, and the corresponding constant currency growth rates These measures exclude the net impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on centrally managed commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, restructuring and impairment charges related to our 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan (2019 Productivity Plan), charges associated with our acquisitions and divestitures, the gain associated with the Juice Transaction, impairment and other charges 44 Table of Contents comprised of Russia-Ukraine conflict charges, brand portfolio impairment charges and other impairment charges, the impact of settlement and curtailment gains and losses related to pension and retiree medical plans, a charge related to cash tender offers, tax benefit related to the IRS audit and tax expense related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJ Act) (see “Items Affecting Comparability” for a detailed description of each of these items). We also evaluate performance on operating profit and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, on a constant currency basis, which measure our financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. We believe these measures provide useful information in evaluating the results of our business because they exclude items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year. Organic revenue growth We define organic revenue growth as a measure that adjusts for the impacts of foreign exchange translation, acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes, and every five or six years, the impact of the 53 rd reporting week, including in our 2022 financial results. Adjusting for acquisitions and divestitures reflects mergers and acquisitions activity, including the impact in 2021 of an extra month of net revenue for our acquisitions of Pioneer Foods in our AMESA division and Be & Cheery in our APAC division as we aligned the reporting calendars of these acquisitions with those of our divisions, as well as divestitures and other structural changes, including changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees. We believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year. See “Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth” in “Results of Operations – Division Review” for further information. Free cash flow We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital spending, plus sales of property, plant and equipment. Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities. Free cash flow is used by us primarily for acquisitions and financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure. See “Free Cash Flow” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information. Return on invested capital (ROIC) and net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability We define ROIC as net income attributable to PepsiCo plus interest expense after-tax divided by the sum of quarterly average debt obligations and quarterly average common shareholders’ equity. Although ROIC is a common financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating ROIC. Accordingly, the method used by management to calculate ROIC may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their ROIC. We believe this metric serves as a measure of how well we use our capital to generate returns. In addition, we use net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability, to compare our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis because it removes from our operating results the impact of items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance and reflects how management evaluates our 45 Table of Contents operating results and trends. We define net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability, as ROIC, adjusted for quarterly average cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, after-tax interest income and items affecting comparability. We believe the calculation of ROIC and net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability, provides useful information to investors and is an additional relevant comparison of our performance to consider when evaluating our capital allocation efficiency. See “Return on Invested Capital” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information. Items Affecting Comparability Our reported financial results in this Form 10-K are impacted by the following items in each of the following years: 2022 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Gain associated with the Juice Transaction Impairment of intangible assets Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 40,576 $ 45,816 $ 34,459 $ (3,321) $ 3,166 $ 11,512 $ 132 $ 1,727 $ 68 $ 8,910 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact (52) 52 (10) — — 62 — 14 — 48 Restructuring and impairment charges (33) 33 (347) — — 380 31 77 1 333 Acquisition and divestiture-related charges — — (74) — — 74 6 14 — 66 Gain associated with the Juice Transaction — — — 3,321 — (3,321) — (433) — (2,888) Impairment and other charges (201) 201 (251) — (3,166) 3,618 — 671 — 2,947 Pension and retiree medical-related impact — — — — — — 307 69 — 238 Tax benefit related to the IRS audit — — — — — — — 319 — (319) Tax expense related to the TCJ Act — — — — — — — (86) — 86 Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 40,290 $ 46,102 $ 33,777 $ — $ — $ 12,325 $ 476 $ 2,372 $ 69 $ 9,421 46 Table of Contents 2021 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Net interest expense and other Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 37,075 $ 42,399 $ 31,237 $ 11,162 $ 522 $ (1,863) $ 2,142 $ 61 $ 7,618 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact (39) 39 20 19 — — 5 — 14 Restructuring and impairment charges (29) 29 (208) 237 10 — 41 1 205 Acquisition and divestiture-related charges (1) 1 5 (4) — — 23 — (27) Pension and retiree medical-related impact — — — — 12 — 1 — 11 Charge related to cash tender offers — — — — — 842 165 — 677 Tax expense related to the TCJ Act — — — — — — (190) — 190 Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 37,006 $ 42,468 $ 31,054 $ 11,414 $ 544 $ (1,021) $ 2,187 $ 62 $ 8,688 (a) Provision for income taxes is the expected tax charge/benefit on the underlying item based on the tax laws and income tax rates applicable to the underlying item in its corresponding tax jurisdiction. 2022 2021 Change Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, GAAP measure $ 6.42 $ 5.49 17 % Mark-to-market net impact 0.03 0.01 Restructuring and impairment charges 0.24 0.15 Acquisition and divestiture-related charges 0.05 (0.02) Gain associated with the Juice Transaction (2.08) — Impairment and other charges 2.12 — Pension and retiree medical-related impact 0.17 0.01 Charge related to cash tender offers — 0.49 Tax benefit related to the IRS audit (0.23) — Tax expense related to the TCJ Act 0.06 0.14 Core net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, non-GAAP measure $ 6.79 (a) $ 6.26 (a) 9 % Impact of foreign exchange translation 2 Growth in core net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP measure 11 % (a) Does not sum due to rounding. Mark-to-Market Net Impact We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include agricultural products, energy and metals. Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in corporate unallocated expenses. Restructuring and Impairment Charges 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan The 2019 Productivity Plan, publicly announced on February 15, 2019, will leverage new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. To build on the successful 47 Table of Contents implementation of the 2019 Productivity Plan, in the fourth quarter of 2022, we expanded and extended the plan through the end of 2028 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives described above. As a result, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $3.65 billion, including cash expenditures of approximately $2.9 billion. Plan to date through December 31, 2022, we have incurred pre-tax charges of $1.5 billion, including cash expenditures of $1.0 billion. In our 2023 financial results, we expect to incur pre-tax charges and cash expenditures of approximately $600 million each. These charges will be funded primarily through cash from operations. We expect to incur the majority of the remaining pre-tax charges and cash expenditures in our 2023 through 2024 financial results, with the balance to be incurred through 2028. Charges include severance and other employee costs, asset impairments and other costs. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further information related to our 2019 Productivity Plan. We regularly evaluate productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plan and other initiatives discussed above and in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. Acquisition and Divestiture-Related Charges Acquisition and divestiture-related charges primarily include fair value adjustments to the acquired inventory included in the acquisition-date balance sheets (recorded in cost of sales), merger and integration charges and costs associated with divestitures (recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses). Merger and integration charges include liabilities to support socioeconomic programs in South Africa, gains associated with contingent consideration, employee-related costs, contract termination costs, closing costs and other integration costs. Divestiture-related charges reflect transaction expenses, including consulting, advisory and other professional fees. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Gain Associated with the Juice Transaction We recognized a gain associated with the Juice Transaction in our PBNA and Europe divisions. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Impairment and Other Charges We recognized Russia-Ukraine conflict charges, brand portfolio impairment charges and other impairment charges as described below. Russia-Ukraine Conflict Charges In connection with the deadly conflict in Ukraine, we recognized charges related to indefinite-lived intangible assets and property, plant and equipment impairment, allowance for expected credit losses, inventory write-downs and other costs. See Notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Brand Portfolio Impairment Charges We recognized intangible asset, investment and property, plant and equipment impairments and other charges as a result of management’s decision to reposition or discontinue the sale/distribution of certain brands and to sell an investment. See Notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. 48 Table of Contents Other Impairment Charges We recognized impairment charges related to certain of our indefinite-lived intangible assets which reflect an increase in the weighted-average cost of capital as well as our most current estimates of future financial performance. See Notes 1 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Pension and Retiree Medical-Related Impact Pension and retiree medical-related impact primarily includes settlement charges related to lump sum distributions exceeding the total of annual service and interest costs, as well as curtailment gains. See Notes 7 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Charge Related to Cash Tender Offers As a result of the cash tender offers for some of our long-term debt, we recorded a charge primarily representing the tender price paid over the carrying value of the tendered notes and loss on treasury rate locks used to mitigate the interest rate risk on the cash tender offers. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Tax Benefit Related to the IRS Audit We recognized a non-cash tax benefit resulting from our agreement with the IRS to settle one of the issues assessed in the 2014 through 2016 tax audit. The agreement covers tax years 2014 through 2019. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Tax Expense Related to the TCJ Act Tax expense related to the TCJ Act reflects adjustments to the mandatory transition tax liability under the TCJ Act. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Our Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our cash generating capability and financial condition, together with our revolving credit facilities, working capital lines and other available methods of debt financing, such as commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs, including with respect to our net capital spending plans. Our primary sources of liquidity include cash from operations, pre-tax cash proceeds of approximately $3.5 billion from the Juice Transaction, proceeds obtained from issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt, and cash and cash equivalents. These sources of cash are available to fund cash outflows that have both a short- and long-term component, including debt repayments and related interest payments; payments for acquisitions; operating leases; purchase, marketing, and other contractual commitments, including capital expenditures and the transition tax liability under the TCJ Act. In addition, these sources of cash fund other cash outflows including anticipated dividend payments and share repurchases. We do not have guarantees or off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, that we believe could have a material impact on our liquidity. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Our Business Risks” and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. 49 Table of Contents Our sources and uses of cash were not materially adversely impacted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict and, to date, we have not identified any material liquidity deficiencies as a result of the conflict. Based on the information currently available to us, we do not expect the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict to have a material impact on our future liquidity. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact the Russia-Ukraine conflict may have on our business and financial results. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Our Business Risks” and Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further information related to the impact of the Russia-Ukraine conflict on our business and financial results. As of December 31, 2022, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in our consolidated subsidiaries subject to currency controls or currency exchange restrictions were not material. The TCJ Act imposed a one-time mandatory transition tax on undistributed international earnings. As of December 31, 2022, our mandatory transition tax liability was $2.6 billion, which must be paid through 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act; we currently expect to pay approximately $309 million of this liability in 2023. Any additional guidance issued by the IRS may impact our recorded amounts for this transition tax liability. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the TCJ Act. As part of our evolving market practices, we work with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions, which include the extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with a majority of our suppliers generally range from 60 to 90 days, which we deem to be commercially reasonable. We will continue to monitor economic conditions and market practice working with our suppliers to adjust as necessary. We also maintain voluntary supply chain finance agreements with several participating global financial institutions. Under these agreements, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, may elect to sell their accounts receivable with PepsiCo to these participating global financial institutions. Supplier participation in these financing arrangements is voluntary. Our suppliers negotiate their financing agreements directly with the respective global financial institutions and we are not a party to these agreements. These financing arrangements allow participating suppliers to leverage PepsiCo’s creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs, which generally provides our suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own. Neither PepsiCo nor any of its subsidiaries provide any guarantees to any third party in connection with these financing arrangements. We have no economic interest in our suppliers’ decision to participate in these agreements. Our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not impacted. All outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in such financing arrangements are recorded within accounts payable and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. We were informed by the participating financial institutions that as of both December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, $1.5 billion of our accounts payable to suppliers who participate in these financing arrangements are outstanding. These supply chain finance arrangements did not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources in the periods presented and we do not expect such arrangements to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality. Working capital needs are impacted by weekly sales, which are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related patterns and generally lowest in the first quarter. On a continuing basis, we consider various transactions to increase shareholder value and enhance our business results, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, dividends, share repurchases, productivity and other efficiency initiatives and other structural changes. These transactions may result in future cash proceeds or payments. 50 Table of Contents The table below summarizes our cash activity: 2022 2021 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 10,811 $ 11,616 Net cash used for investing activities $ (2,430) $ (3,269) Net cash used for financing activities $ (8,523) $ (10,780) Operating Activities In 2022, net cash provided by operating activities was $10.8 billion, compared to $11.6 billion in the prior year. The decrease in operating cash flow primarily reflects unfavorable working capital comparisons and higher net cash tax payments, partially offset by favorable operating profit performance and lower pre-tax pension and retiree medical plan contributions in the current year. Investing Activities In 2022, net cash used for investing activities was $2.4 billion, primarily reflecting net capital spending of $5.0 billion and our investment in Celsius Holdings, Inc. (Celsius) convertible preferred stock and agreement to distribute Celsius energy drinks of $0.8 billion, partially offset by proceeds associated with the Juice Transaction of $3.5 billion. In 2021, net cash used for investing activities was $3.3 billion, primarily reflecting net capital spending of $4.5 billion, partially offset by maturities of short-term investments with maturities greater than three months of $1.1 billion. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of capital spending by division; see Notes 4 and 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our agreement with and investment in Celsius; and see Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our acquisitions. We regularly review our plans with respect to net capital spending, including in light of the ongoing uncertainty caused by the Russia-Ukraine conflict on our business, and believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our net capital spending needs. Financing Activities In 2022, net cash used for financing activities was $8.5 billion, primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividend payments of $6.2 billion and share repurchases of $1.5 billion, payments of long-term debt borrowings of $2.5 billion and debt redemptions/cash tender offers of $1.7 billion, partially offset by proceeds from issuances of long-term debt of $3.4 billion. In 2021, net cash used for financing activities was $10.8 billion, primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders largely through dividend payments of $5.8 billion, cash tender offers/debt redemption of $4.8 billion, payments of long-term debt borrowings of $3.5 billion and payments of acquisition-related contingent consideration of $0.8 billion, partially offset by proceeds from issuances of long-term debt of $4.1 billion. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of debt obligations. We annually review our capital structure with our Board, including our dividend policy and share repurchase activity. On February 10, 2022, we announced a share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $10.0 billion of PepsiCo common stock which commenced on February 11, 2022 and will expire on February 28, 2026. In addition, on February 9, 2023, we announced a 10.0% increase in our annualized dividend to $5.06 per share from $4.60 per share, effective with the dividend expected to be paid in June 2023. We expect to return a total of approximately $7.7 billion to shareholders in 2023, comprising dividends of approximately $6.7 billion and share repurchases of approximately $1.0 billion. 51 Table of Contents Free Cash Flow The table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities, as reflected on our cash flow statement, to our free cash flow. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on free cash flow, see “Non-GAAP Measures.” 2022 2021 Change Net cash provided by operating activities, GAAP measure $ 10,811 $ 11,616 (7) % Capital spending (5,207) (4,625) Sales of property, plant and equipment 251 166 Free cash flow, non-GAAP measure $ 5,855 $ 7,157 (18) % We use free cash flow primarily for acquisitions and financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. We expect to continue to return free cash flow to our shareholders primarily through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global capital and credit markets at favorable interest rates. However, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Our Business Risks” for certain factors that may impact our credit ratings or our operating cash flows. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, whether or not as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Our Business Risks” and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.

These policies may require management to make difficult and subjective judgments regarding uncertainties, including the business and economic uncertainty resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the high interest rate and inflationary cost environment, and as a result, such estimates may significantly impact our financial results. The precision of these estimates and the likelihood of future changes depend on a number of underlying variables and a range of possible outcomes. We applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all material respects and for all periods presented. We have discussed our critical accounting policies and estimates with our Audit Committee. 54 Table of Contents Our critical accounting policies and estimates are: • revenue recognition; • goodwill and other intangible assets; • income tax expense and accruals; and • pension and retiree medical plans. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when our performance obligation is satisfied. Our primary performance obligation (the distribution and sales of beverage and convenient food products) is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to our customers, which is also when control is transferred. The transfer of control of products to our customers is typically based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return. However, our policy for DSD, including certain chilled products, is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect. Similarly, our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. As a result, we record reserves, based on estimates, for anticipated damaged and out-of-date produc ts. Our products are sold for cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry practices, typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the United States, and generally within 30 to 90 days internationally, and may allow discounts for early payment. We estimate and reserve for our expected credit loss exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility, write-off history, the aging of accounts receivable, our analysis of customer data, and forward-looking information (including the expected impact of a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment), leveraging estimates of creditworthiness and projections of default and recovery rates for certain of our customers. Our policy is to provide customers with product when needed. In fact, our commitment to freshness and product dating serves to regulate the quantity of product shipped or delivered. In addition, DSD products are placed on the shelf by our employees with customer shelf space and storerooms limiting the quantity of product. For product delivered through other distribution networks, we monitor customer inventory levels. As discussed in “Our Customers” in “Item 1. Business,” we offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to customers for performing activities on our behalf, such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new products, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices. Sales incentives and discounts also include support provided to our independent bottlers through funding of advertising and other marketing activities. A number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur after year-end once reconciled and settled. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred. 55 Table of Contents See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our revenue recognition and related policies, including total marketplace spending. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We sell products under a number of brand names, many of which were developed by us. Brand development costs are expensed as incurred. We also purchase brands and other intangible assets in acquisitions. In a business combination, the consideration is first assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities, including brands and other intangible assets, based on estimated fair values, with any excess recorded as goodwill. Determining fair value requires significant estimates and assumptions, including those related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment, based on an evaluation of a number of factors, such as marketplace participants, product life cycles, market share, consumer awareness, brand history and future expansion expectations, amount and timing of future cash flows and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. We believe that a brand has an indefinite life if it has a history of strong revenue and cash flow performance and we have the intent and ability to support the brand with marketplace spending for the foreseeable future. If these indefinite-lived brand criteria are not met, brands are amortized over their expected useful lives, which generally range from 20 to 40 years. Determining the expected life of a brand requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors, including market share, consumer awareness, brand history, future expansion expectations and regulatory restrictions, as well as the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brand is sold. In connection with previous acquisitions, we reacquired certain franchise rights which provided the exclusive and perpetual rights to manufacture and/or distribute beverages for sale in specified territories. In determining the useful life of these franchise rights, many factors were considered, including the pre-existing perpetual bottling arrangements, the indefinite period expected for these franchise rights to contribute to our future cash flows, as well as the lack of any factors that would limit the useful life of these franchise rights to us, including legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors. Therefore, certain of these franchise rights are considered as indefinite-lived. Franchise rights that are not considered indefinite-lived are amortized over the remaining contractual period of the contract in which the right was granted. Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and, as a result, are assessed for impairment at least annually, using either a qualitative or quantitative approach. We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Where we use the qualitative assessment, first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered include macroeconomic conditions (including those related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment), industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environment, historical financial performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed. In the quantitative assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, an assessment is performed to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and the reporting unit, respectively. Estimated fair value is determined using discounted cash flows and requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with management’s strategic business plans, annual sales growth rates, perpetuity growth assumptions and the selection of assumptions underlying a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. Significant management judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeconomic and other factors (including those related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and a high 56 Table of Contents interest rate and inflationary cost environment) to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, such as forecasted growth rates (including perpetuity growth assumptions) and weighted-average cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. A deterioration in these assumptions could adversely impact our results. These assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain of the risks described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Our Business Risks.” In 2022, we recorded $1.3 billion ($1.1 billion after-tax or $0.78 per share) of indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges related to the SodaStream brand in Europe. As a result, its carrying value as of December 31, 2022 is equal to its fair value and the brand is at a heightened risk of future impairment if certain assumptions and estimates were to change. For example, a mutually exclusive 100-basis-point increase in the discount rate and a 100-basis-point decrease in the perpetuity growth rate used to estimate the fair value of the SodaStream brand would result in an additional estimated impairment charge of approximately $0.2 billion and $0.1 billion, respectively. We will continue to monitor the performance of the SodaStream brand and goodwill, as well as all of our indefinite-lived intangible assets. Amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows. See Notes 2 and 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Income Tax Expense and Accruals Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax structure and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we likely will not succeed. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit, new tax laws, relevant court cases or tax authority settlements. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion. An estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to our quarterly operating results. In the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the same time as that item. We consider the tax adjustments from the resolution of prior-year tax matters to be among such items. Tax law requires items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our consolidated financial statements. As a result, our annual tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different than that reported in our tax returns (our cash tax rate). Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit on our consolidated financial statements. We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is not more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our consolidated financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but have not yet recognized as expense in our consolidated financial statements. 57 Table of Contents In 2022, our annual tax rate was 16.1% compared to 21.8% in 2021. See “Other Consolidated Results” for further information. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Pension and Retiree Medical Plans Our pension plans cover certain employees in the United States and certain international employees. Benefits are determined based on either years of service or a combination of years of service and earnings. Certain U.S. and Canada retirees are also eligible for medical and life insurance benefits (retiree medical) if they meet age and service requirements. Generally, our share of retiree medical costs is capped at specified dollar amounts, which vary based upon years of service, with retirees contributing the remainder of the cost. In addition, we have been phasing out certain subsidies of retiree medical benefits. See “Items Affecting Comparability” and Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for information about changes and settlements within our pension plans. Our Assumptions The determination of pension and retiree medical expenses and obligations requires the use of assumptions to estimate the amount of benefits that employees earn while working, as well as the present value of those benefits. Annual pension and retiree medical expense amounts are principally based on four components: (1) the value of benefits earned by employees for working during the year (service cost), (2) the increase in the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time (interest cost), and (3) other gains and losses as discussed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, reduced by (4) the expected return on assets for our funded plans. Significant assumptions used to measure our annual pension and retiree medical expenses include: • certain employee-related demographic factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; • the expected rate of return on assets in our funded plans; • the spot rates along the yield curve used to determine service and interest costs and the present value of liabilities; • for pension expense, the rate of salary increases for plans where benefits are based on earnings; and • for retiree medical expense, health care cost trend rates. Certain assumptions reflect our historical experience and management’s best judgment regarding future expectations. All actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually, except in the case of an interim remeasurement due to a significant event such as a curtailment or settlement. Due to the significant management judgment involved, these assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension and retiree medical expenses and obligations. At each measurement date, the discount rates are based on interest rates for high-quality, long-term corporate debt securities with maturities comparable to those of our liabilities. Our U.S. obligation and pension and retiree medical expense is based on the discount rates determined using the Mercer Above Mean Curve. This curve includes bonds that closely match the timing and amount of our expected benefit payments and reflects the portfolio of investments we would consider to settle our liabilities. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for information about the expected rate of return on plan assets and our plans’ investment strategy. Although we review our expected long-term rates of return on an annual basis, our asset returns in a given year do not significantly influence our evaluation of long-term rates of return. 58 Table of Contents The health care trend rate used to determine our retiree medical plans’ obligation and expense is reviewed annually. Our review is based on our claims experience, information provided by our health plans and actuaries, and our knowledge of the health care industry. Our review of the trend rate considers factors such as demographics, plan design, new medical technologies and changes in medical carriers. Weighted-average assumptions for pension and retiree medical expense are as follows: 2023 2022 2021 Pension Service cost discount rate (a) 5.5 % 3.2 % 2.6 % Interest cost discount rate (a) 5.4 % 2.9 % 1.9 % Expected rate of return on plan assets (a) 7.0 % 6.3 % 6.2 % Expected rate of salary increases 3.3 % 3.1 % 3.1 % Retiree medical Service cost discount rate 5.4 % 2.8 % 2.3 % Interest cost discount rate 5.3 % 2.1 % 1.6 % Expected rate of return on plan assets 7.1 % 5.7 % 5.4 % Current health care cost trend rate 5.5 % 5.8 % 5.5 % (a) 2022 rates reflect remeasurement of a U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan in the second quarter of 2022. In 2022, lump sum distributions exceeded the total of annual service and interest cost and triggered pre-tax settlement charges for certain U.S defined pension plans. In addition, we expect the recognition of fixed income losses on plan assets, partially offset by higher discount rates, to increase our pension and retiree medical expense in 2023. Sensitivity of Assumptions A decrease in each of the collective discount rates or in the expected rate of return assumptions would increase expense for our benefit plans. A 25-basis-point decrease in each of the above discount rates and expected rate of return assumptions would individually increase 2023 pre-tax pension and retiree medical expense as follows: Assumption Amount Discount rates used in the calculation of expense $ 13 Expected rate of return $ 38 Funding We make contributions to pension trusts that provide plan benefits for certain pension plans. These contributions are made in accordance with applicable tax regulations that provide for current tax deductions for our contributions and taxation to the employee only upon receipt of plan benefits. Generally, we do not fund our pension plans when our contributions would not be currently tax deductible. As our retiree medical plans are not subject to regulatory funding requirements, we generally fund these plans on a pay-as-you-go basis, although we periodically review available options to make additional contributions toward these benefits. We made a discretionary contribution of $125 million to a U.S. qualified defined benefit plan in January 2023 and expect to make an additional $125 million in the third quarter of 2023. Our pension and retiree medical plan contributions are subject to change as a result of many factors, such as changes in interest rates, deviations between actual and expected asset returns and changes in tax or other benefit laws. We regularly evaluate different opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for our past and expected contributions and estimated future benefit payments. 59 Table of Contents Consolidated Statement of Income PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries Fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020 (in millions except per share amounts) 2022 2021 2020 Net Revenue $ 86,392 $ 79,474 $ 70,372 Cost of sales 40,576 37,075 31,797 Gross profit 45,816 42,399 38,575 Selling, general and administrative expenses 34,459 31,237 28,453 Gain associated with the Juice Transaction (see Note 13) ( 3,321 ) — — Impairment of intangible assets (see Notes 1 and 4) 3,166 — 42 Operating Profit 11,512 11,162 10,080 Other pension and retiree medical benefits income 132 522 117 Net interest expense and other ( 939 ) ( 1,863 ) ( 1,128 ) Income before income taxes 10,705 9,821 9,069 Provision for income taxes 1,727 2,142 1,894 Net income 8,978 7,679 7,175 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 68 61 55 Net Income Attributable to PepsiCo $ 8,910 $ 7,618 $ 7,120 Net Income Attributable to PepsiCo per Common Share Basic $ 6.45 $ 5.51 $ 5.14 Diluted $ 6.42 $ 5.49 $ 5.12 Weighted-average common shares outstanding Basic 1,380 1,382 1,385 Diluted 1,387 1,389 1,392 See accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. 60 Table of Contents Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries Fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020 (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Net income $ 8,978 $ 7,679 $ 7,175 Other comprehensive (loss)/income, net of taxes: Net currency translation adjustment ( 643 ) ( 369 ) ( 650 ) Net change on cash flow hedges ( 158 ) 155 7 Net pension and retiree medical adjustments 389 770 ( 532 ) Other 4 22 ( 1 ) ( 408 ) 578 ( 1,176 ) Comprehensive income 8,570 8,257 5,999 Less: Comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests 64 61 55 Comprehensive Income Attributable to PepsiCo $ 8,506 $ 8,196 $ 5,944 See accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. 61 Table of Contents Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries Fiscal years ended December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020 (in millions) 2022 2021 2020 Operating Activities Net income $ 8,978 $ 7,679 $ 7,175 Depreciation and amortization 2,763 2,710 2,548 Gain associated with the Juice Transaction ( 3,321 ) — — Impairment and other charges 3,618 — — Operating lease right-of-use asset amortization 517 505 478 Share-based compensation expense 343 301 264 Restructuring and impairment charges 411 247 289 Cash payments for restructuring charges ( 224 ) ( 256 ) ( 255 ) Acquisition and divestiture-related charges 80 ( 4 ) 255 Cash payments for acquisition and divestiture-related charges ( 46 ) ( 176 ) ( 131 ) Pension and retiree medical plan expenses 419 123 408 Pension and retiree medical plan contributions ( 384 ) ( 785 ) ( 562 ) Deferred income taxes and other tax charges and credits ( 873 ) 298 361 Tax expense related to the TCJ Act 86 190 — Tax payments related to the TCJ Act ( 309 ) ( 309 ) ( 78 ) Change in assets and liabilities: Accounts and notes receivable ( 1,763 ) ( 651 ) ( 420 ) Inventories ( 1,142 ) ( 582 ) ( 516 ) Prepaid expenses and other current assets 118 159 26 Accounts payable and other current liabilities 1,842 1,762 766 Income taxes payable 57 30 ( 159 ) Other, net ( 359 ) 375 164 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 10,811 11,616 10,613 Investing Activities Capital spending ( 5,207 ) ( 4,625 ) ( 4,240 ) Sales of property, plant and equipment 251 166 55 Acquisitions, net of cash acquired, investments in noncontrolled affiliates and purchases of intangible and other assets ( 873 ) ( 61 ) ( 6,372 ) Proceeds associated with the Juice Transaction 3,456 — — Other divestitures, sales of investments in noncontrolled affiliates and other assets 49 169 6 Short-term investments, by original maturity: More than three months -

See accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. 65 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 — Basis of Presentation and Our Divisions Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and include the consolidated accounts of PepsiCo, Inc. and the affiliates that we control. In addition, we include our share of the results of certain other affiliates using the equity method based on our economic ownership interest, our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating or financial decisions of these affiliates or our ability to direct their economic resources. We do not control these other affiliates, as our ownership in these other affiliates is generally 50 % or less. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. As a result of exchange restrictions and other operating restrictions, we do not have control over our Venezuelan subsidiaries. As such, our Venezuelan subsidiaries are not included within our consolidated financial results for any period presented. Raw materials, direct labor and plant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, costs directly related to production planning, inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities, are included in cost of sales. The costs of moving, storing and delivering finished product, including merchandising activities, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are used in determining, among other items, sales incentives accruals, tax reserves, share-based compensation, pension and retiree medical accruals, amounts and useful lives for intangible assets and future cash flows associated with impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets, goodwill and other long-lived assets. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience, as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances, such as current economic conditions, and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change. Additionally, the business and economic uncertainty resulting from the Russia - Ukraine conflict and the high interest rate and inflationary cost environment has made such estimates and assumptions more difficult to calculate. As future events and their effect cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of each December, resulting in a 53 rd reporting week every five or six years, including in our 2022 financial results. While our North America financial results are reported on a weekly calendar basis, substantially all of our international operations reported on a monthly calendar basis prior to the fourth quarter of 2021. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, all of our international operations reported on a monthly calendar basis. This change did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The following chart details our quarterly reporting schedule for 2022, reflecting the additional week in the fourth quarter: Quarter United States and Canada International First Quarter 12 weeks January, February Second Quarter 12 weeks March, April and May Third Quarter 12 weeks June, July and August Fourth Quarter 17 weeks September, October, November and December Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Certain reclassifications were made to the prior year’s consolidated financial statements to conform to the current year presentation. 66 Table of Contents Our Divisions We are organized into seven reportable segments (also referred to as divisions), as follows: 1) Frito-Lay North America (FLNA), which includes our branded convenient food businesses in the United States and Canada; 2) Quaker Foods North America (QFNA), which includes our branded convenient food businesses, such as cereal, rice, pasta and other branded food, in the United States and Canada; 3) PepsiCo Beverages North America (PBNA), which includes our beverage businesses in the United States and Canada; 4) Latin America (LatAm), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Latin America; 5) Europe, which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Europe; 6) Africa, Middle East and South Asia (AMESA), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia; and 7) Asia Pacific, Australia, and New Zealand and China region (APAC), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand, and China region. Through our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a wide variety of beverages and convenient foods, serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories with our largest operations in the United States, Mexico, Russia, Canada, China, the United Kingdom and South Africa. The accounting policies for the divisions are the same as those described in Note 2, except for the following allocation methodologies: • share-based compensation expense; • pension and retiree medical expense; and • derivatives. Share-Based Compensation Expense Our divisions are held accountable for share-based compensation expense and, therefore, this expense is allocated to our divisions as an incremental employee compensation cost. The allocation of share-based compensation expense of each division is as follows: 2022 2021 2020 FLNA 13 % 13 % 13 % QFNA 1 % 1 % 1 % PBNA 20 % 19 % 18 % LatAm 6 % 5 % 6 % Europe 11 % 13 % 16 % AMESA 5 % 6 % 6 % APAC 3 % 2 % 2 % Corporate unallocated expenses 41 % 41 % 38 % The expense allocated to our divisions excludes any impact of changes in our assumptions during the year which reflect market conditions over which division management has no control. Therefore, any variances between allocated expense and our actual expense are recognized in corporate unallocated expenses. 67 Table of Contents Pension and Retiree Medical Expense Pension and retiree medical service costs measured at fixed discount rates are reflected in division results. The variance between the fixed discount rate used to determine the service cost reflected in division results and the discount rate as disclosed in Note 7 is reflected in corporate unallocated expenses. Derivatives We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include agricultural products, energy and metals. Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in corporate unallocated expenses. These derivatives hedge underlying commodity price risk and were not entered into for trading or speculative purposes. Net Revenue and Operating Profit/(Loss) Net revenue and operating profit/(loss) of each division are as follows: Net Revenue Operating Profit/(Loss) 2022 2021 2020 2022 (a) 2021 2020 FLNA $ 23,291 $ 19,608 $ 18,189 $ 6,135 $ 5,633 $ 5,340 QFNA 3,160 2,751 2,742 604 578 669 PBNA (b) 26,213 25,276 22,559 5,426 2,442 1,937 LatAm 9,779 8,108 6,942 1,627 1,369 1,033 Europe (b) 12,724 13,038 11,922 ( 1,380 ) 1,292 1,353 AMESA (c) 6,438 6,078 4,573 666 858 600 APAC (c) 4,787 4,615 3,445 537 673 590 Total division 86,392 79,474 70,372 13,615 12,845 11,522 Corporate unallocated expenses — — — ( 2,103 ) ( 1,683 ) ( 1,442 ) Total $ 86,392 $ 79,474 $ 70,372 $ 11,512 $ 11,162 $ 10,080 (a) See below for impairment and other charges taken related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, brand portfolio impairment and other impairment. (b) In 2022, we recorded a gain of $ 3,029 million and $ 292 million in our PBNA and Europe divisions, respectively, associated with the Juice Transaction. The total after-tax amount was $ 2,888 million or $ 2.08 per share. See Note 13 for further information. (c) In 2021, the increase in net revenue in our AMESA and APAC divisions reflect our acquisitions of Pioneer Foods and Be & Cheery, respectively. See Note 13 for further information. 68 Table of Contents Disaggregation of Net Revenue Our primary performance obligation is the distribution and sales of beverage and convenient food products to our customers. The following table reflects the approximate percentage of net revenue generated between our beverage business and our convenient food business for each of our international divisions, as well as our consolidated net revenue: 2022 2021 2020 Beverages (a) Convenient Foods Beverages (a) Convenient Foods Beverages (a) Convenient Foods LatAm 10 % 90 % 10 % 90 % 10 % 90 % Europe 50 % 50 % 55 % 45 % 55 % 45 % AMESA 30 % 70 % 30 % 70 % 30 % 70 % APAC 25 % 75 % 20 % 80 % 25 % 75 % PepsiCo 40 % 60 % 45 % 55 % 45 % 55 % (a) Beverage revenue from company-owned bottlers, which primarily includes our consolidated bottling operations in our PBNA and Europe divisions, is approximately 35 % of our consolidated net revenue in 2022 and approximately 40 % of our consolidated net revenue in 2021 and 2020. Generally, our finished goods beverage operations produce higher net revenue, but lower operating margins as compared to concentrate sold to authorized bottling partners for the manufacture of finished goods beverages Impairment and Other Charges We recognized Russia-Ukraine conflict charges, brand portfolio impairment charges and other impairment charges as described below. A summary of pre-tax charges taken in 2022 in our Europe division as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict is as follows: Russia-Ukraine conflict charges Cost of sales Selling, general and administrative expenses Impairment of intangible assets (a) Total Impairment charges related to intangible assets $ — $ — $ 1,198 $ 1,198 Impairment charges related to property, plant and equipment 103 22 — 125 Allowance for expected credit losses — 12 — 12 Allowance for inventory write downs 28 1 — 29 Other 9 42 — 51 Total $ 140 $ 77 $ 1,198 $ 1,415 After-tax amount $ 1,124 Impact on net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share $ ( 0.81 ) (a) See Note 4 for further information.

These pre-tax charges by division are as follows: COVID-19 charges 2022 2021 2020 FLNA $ 25 $ 56 $ 229 QFNA 1 2 15 PBNA (a) 23 ( 11 ) 304 LatAm 15 64 102 Europe 5 21 88 AMESA 5 7 33 APAC 21 9 3 Total $ 95 $ 148 $ 774 (a) Income amount primarily relates to adjustments for changes in estimates of allowances for expected credit losses and upfront payments to customers, due to improved projected default rates and lower at-risk balances.

Note 2 — Our Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when our performance obligation is satisfied. Our primary performance obligation (the distribution and sales of beverage and convenient food products) is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to our customers, which is also when control is transferred. Merchandising activities are performed after a customer obtains control of the product, are accounted for as fulfillment of our performance obligation to ship or deliver product to our customers and are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Merchandising activities are immaterial in the context of our contracts. In addition, we exclude from net revenue all sales, use, value-added and certain excise taxes assessed by government authorities on revenue producing transactions. The transfer of control of products to our customers is typically based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return. However, our policy for DSD, including certain chilled products, is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect. Similarly, our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products 72 Table of Contents is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. As a result, we record reserves, based on estimates, for anticipated damaged and out-of-date produc ts. Our products are sold for cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry practices, typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the United States, and generally within 30 to 90 days internationally, and may allow discounts for early payment. We estimate and reserve for our expected credit loss exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility, write-off history, the aging of accounts receivable, our analysis of customer data, and forward-looking information (including the expected impact of a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment), leveraging estimates of creditworthiness and projections of default and recovery rates for certain of our customers. We are exposed to concentration of credit risk from our major customers, including Walmart. We have not experienced credit issues with these customers. In 2022, sales to Walmart and its affiliates (including Sam’s) represented approximately 14 % of our consolidated net revenue, including concentrate sales to our independent bottlers, which were used in finished goods sold by them to Walmart. Total Marketplace Spending We offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to customers for performing activities on our behalf, such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new products, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices. Sales incentives and discounts also include support provided to our independent bottlers through funding of advertising and other marketing activities. A number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur after year-end once reconciled and settled. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred. The terms of most of our incentive arrangements do not exceed one year and, therefore, do not require highly uncertain long-term estimates. Certain arrangements, such as fountain pouring rights, may extend beyond one year. Upfront payments to customers under these arrangements are recognized over the shorter of the economic or contractual life, primarily as a reduction of revenue, and the remaining balances of $ 242 million as of December 31, 2022 and $ 262 million as of December 25, 2021 are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on our balance sheet. For interim reporting, our policy is to allocate our forecasted full-year sales incentives for most of our programs to each of our interim reporting periods in the same year that benefits from the programs. The allocation methodology is based on our forecasted sales incentives for the full year and the proportion of each interim period’s actual gross revenue or volume, as applicable, to our forecasted annual gross revenue or volume, as applicable. Based on our review of the forecasts at each interim period, any changes in estimates and the related allocation of sales incentives are recognized beginning in the interim period that they are identified. In addition, we apply a similar allocation methodology for interim reporting purposes for certain advertising and other marketing activities. Our annual consolidated financial statements are not impacted by this interim allocation methodology. 73 Table of Contents Advertising and other marketing activities, reported as selling, general and administrative expenses, totaled $ 5.2 billion in 2022, $ 5.1 billion in 2021 and $ 4.6 billion in 2020, including advertising expenses of $ 3.5 billion in both 2022 and 2021, and $ 3.0 billion in 2020. Deferred advertising costs are not expensed until the year first used and consist of: • media and personal service prepayments; • promotional materials in inventory; and • production costs of future media advertising. Deferred advertising costs of $ 40 million and $ 53 million as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, respectively, are classified as prepaid expenses and other current assets on our balance sheet. Distribution Costs Distribution costs, including the costs of shipping and handling activities, which include certain merchandising activities, are reported as selling, general and administrative expenses. Shipping and handling expenses were $ 15.0 billion in 2022, $ 13.7 billion in 2021 and $ 11.9 billion in 2020. Software Costs We capitalize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use when both the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable that the software will be used as intended. Capitalized software costs include (1) external direct costs of materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining computer software, (2) compensation and related benefits for employees who are directly associated with the software projects and (3) interest costs incurred while developing internal-use computer software. Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and equipment on our balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis when placed into service over the estimated useful lives of the software, which approximate five to 10 years. Software amortization totaled $ 123 million in 2022, $ 135 million in 2021 and $ 152 million in 2020. Net capitalized software and development costs were $ 1.1 billion and $ 0.8 billion as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, respectively. Commitments and Contingencies We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, certain taxes and environmental matters, as well as commitments under contractual and other commercial obligations. We recognize liabilities for contingencies and commitments when a loss is probable and estimable. Research and Development We engage in a variety of research and development activities and continue to invest to accelerate growth and to drive innovation globally. Consumer research is excluded from research and development costs and included in other marketing costs. Research and development costs were $ 771 million, $ 752 million and $ 719 million in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are reported within selling, general and administrative expenses. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and, as a result, are assessed for impairment at least annually, using either a qualitative or quantitative approach. We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Where we use the qualitative assessment, first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered include macroeconomic conditions (including those related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment), industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environment, 74 Table of Contents historical financial performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed. In the quantitative assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, an assessment is performed to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and the reporting unit, respectively. Estimated fair value is determined using discounted cash flows and requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with management’s strategic business plans, annual sales growth rates, perpetuity growth assumptions and the selection of assumptions underlying a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. Significant management judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeconomic and other factors (including those related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment) to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, such as forecasted growth rates (including perpetuity growth assumptions) and weighted-average cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. A deterioration in these assumptions could adversely impact our results. Amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows. See Note 4 for further information. Other Significant Accounting Policies Our other significant accounting policies are disclosed as follows: • Basis of Presentation – Note 1 includes a description of our policies regarding use of estimates, basis of presentation and consolidation. • Income Taxes – Note 5. • Share-Based Compensation – Note 6. • Pension, Retiree Medical and Savings Plans – Note 7. • Financial Instruments – Note 9. • Cash Equivalents – Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. • Inventories – Note 14. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the average; first-in, first-out (FIFO); or, in limited instances, last-in, first-out (LIFO) methods. • Property, Plant and Equipment – Note 14. Property, plant and equipment is recorded at historical cost. Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis over an asset’s estimated useful life. Construction in progress is not depreciated until ready for service. • Translation of Financial Statements of Foreign Subsidiaries – Financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates for revenues and expenses. Adjustments resulting from translating net assets are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders’ equity as currency translation adjustment. 75 Table of Contents Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements - Not Yet Adopted In September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance to enhance the transparency of supplier finance programs to allow financial statement users to understand the effect on working capital, liquidity and cash flows. The new guidance requires disclosure of key terms of the program, including a description of the payment terms, payment timing and assets pledged as security or other forms of guarantees provided to the finance provider or intermediary. Other requirements include the disclosure of the amount that remains unpaid as of the end of the reporting period, a description of where these obligations are presented in the balance sheet and a rollforward of the obligation during the annual period. The guidance is effective in the first quarter of 2023, except for the rollforward, which is effective in 2024. Early adoption is permitted. We will adopt the guidance when effective. Note 3 — Restructuring and Impairment Charges 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan We publicly announced a multi-year productivity plan on February 15, 2019 (2019 Productivity Plan) that will leverage new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. To build on the successful implementation of the 2019 Productivity Plan, in the fourth quarter of 2022, we expanded and extended the plan through the end of 2028 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives described above. As a result, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $ 3.65 billion, including cash expenditures of approximately $ 2.9 billion. These pre-tax charges are expected to consist of approximately 55 % of severance and other employee-related costs, 10 % for asset impairments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related actions and 35 % for other co sts associated with the implementation of our initiatives. The total plan pre-tax charges are expected to be incurred by division approximately as follows: FLNA QFNA PBNA LatAm Europe AMESA APAC Corporate Expected pre-tax charges 15 % 1 % 25 % 10 % 25 % 5 % 4 % 15 % A summary of our 2019 Productivity Plan charges is as follows: 2022 2021 2020 Cost of sales $ 33 $ 29 $ 30 Selling, general and administrative expenses 347 208 239 Other pension and retiree medical benefits expense 31 10 20 Total restructuring and impairment charges $ 411 $ 247 $ 289 After-tax amount $ 334 $ 206 $ 231 Impact on net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share $ ( 0.24 ) $ ( 0.15 ) $ ( 0.17 ) 76 Table of Contents 2022 2021 2020 Plan to Date through 12/31/2022 FLNA $ 46 $ 28 $ 83 $ 210 QFNA 7 — 5 19 PBNA 68 20 47 226 LatAm 32 37 31 171 Europe 109 81 48 343 AMESA 12 15 14 82 APAC 16 7 5 77 Corporate 90 49 36 229 380 237 269 1,357 Other pension and retiree medical benefits income 31 10 20 98 Total $ 411 $ 247 $ 289 $ 1,455 Plan to Date through 12/31/2022 Severance and other employee costs $ 807 Asset impairments 190 Other costs 458 Total $ 1,455 Severance and other employee costs primarily include severance and other termination benefits, as well as voluntary separation arrangements.

Substantially all of the restructuring accrual at December 31, 2022 is expected to be paid by the end of 2023. Other Productivity Initiatives There were no material charges related to other productivity and efficiency initiatives outside the scope of the 2019 Productivity Plan. 77 Table of Contents We regularly evaluate different productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plan and other initiatives described above. For information on additional impairment charges, see Notes 1 and 4 for brand portfolio impairment charges, other impairment charges and Russia-Ukraine conflict charges. Note 4 — Intangible Assets A summary of our amortizable intangible assets is as follows: 2022 2021 2020 Average Useful Life (Years) Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Acquired franchise rights (a) 56 – 60 $ 837 $ ( 200 ) $ 637 $ 976 $ ( 187 ) $ 789 Customer relationships 10 – 24 571 ( 237 ) 334 623 ( 227 ) 396 Brands 20 – 40 1,097 ( 973 ) 124 1,151 ( 989 ) 162 Other identifiable intangibles 10 – 24 447 ( 265 ) 182 451 ( 260 ) 191 Total $ 2,952 $ ( 1,675 ) $ 1,277 $ 3,201 $ ( 1,663 ) $ 1,538 Amortization expense $ 78 $ 91 $ 90 (a) Decrease is primarily due to the write-off of our distribution rights for Bang energy drinks. See Note 1 for further information. Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis over an intangible asset’s estimated useful life. Amortization of intangible assets for each of the next five years, based on existing intangible assets as of December 31, 2022 and using average 2022 foreign exchange rates, is expected to be as follows: 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 Five-year projected amortization $ 77 $ 76 $ 74 $ 67 $ 64 Depreciable and amortizable assets are evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. In these circumstances, if an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on discounted future cash flows. Useful lives are periodically evaluated to determine whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate the need for revision. Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets In the first quarter of 2022, we discontinued or repositioned certain juice and dairy brands in Russia in our Europe division. As a result, we recognized pre-tax impairment charges (included in brand portfolio impairment charges) of $ 241 million ($ 193 million after-tax or $ 0.14 per share) in impairment of intangible assets, primarily related to indefinite-lived intangible assets in the year ended December 31, 2022. See Note 1 for further information. 78 Table of Contents In the second quarter of 2022, macroeconomic factors, sanctions and other regul ations as a result of the Russia-Ukraine conflict indicated a material deterioration of the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in Russia, primarily assumptions underlying the weighted-average cost of capital. These factors required us to perform a quantitative assessment, despite the absence of a material adverse impact on these assets’ financial performance (e.g., sales, operating profit, cash flows). The fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in Russia was estimated using discounted cash flows under the income approach, which we consider to be a Level 3 measurement. We determined that the carrying value exceeds the fair value, with the decrease in the fair value primarily attributable to a significant increase in the weighted-average cost of capital, which reflects the macroeconomic uncertainty in Russia. As a result of the quantitative assessment, we recorded pre-tax impairment charges of $ 1.2 billion ($ 958 million after-tax or $ 0.69 per share) in impairment of intangible assets, related to our juice and dairy brands in Russia in our Europe division, in the year ended December 31, 2022. See Note 1 for further information. As discussed in Note 2, we perform our annual impairment assessment on indefinite-lived intangible assets during our third quarter. The annual impairment assessment on indefinite-lived intangible assets performed in the third quarter of 2022, based on best available market information and our internal forecasts and operating plans at the time, resulted in no impairment. In the fourth quarter of 2022, macroeconomic conditions including a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment, coupled with recent business performance, indicated a deterioration of the significant inputs used to determine the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in various markets, primarily assumptions underlying the weighted-average cost of capital and the impact of economic uncertainty on current and future financial performance, and required us to perform a quantitative assessment on certain assets. The fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets was estimated using discounted cash flows under the income approach, which we consider to be a Level 3 measurement. We determined that the carrying value exceeded the fair value, which reflects the increase in the weighted-average cost of capital as well as our most current estimates of future sales and their contributions to operating profit and expected future cash flows (including perpetuity growth assumptions). As a result of the quantitative assessment, we recorded pre-tax impairment charges of $ 1.6 billion ($ 1.3 billion after-tax or $ 0.94 per share) in impairment of intangible assets, primarily related to the SodaStream brand in our Europe division, in the year ended December 31, 2022. See Note 1 for further information. As of December 31, 2022, the estimated fair values of our indefinite-lived reacquired and acquired franchise rights recorded at PBNA exceeded their carrying values. However, there could be an impairment of the carrying value of PBNA’s reacquired and acquired franchise rights, as well as further impairment to the carrying value of the SodaStream brand and goodwill, if future sales and their contributions to operating profit do not achieve our expected future cash flows (including perpetuity growth assumptions) or if macroeconomic conditions result in a future increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value. We did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in each of the years ended December 31, 2022, December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020. We did not recognize any impairment charges for indefinite-lived intangible assets in the year ended December 25, 2021. In 2020, we recognized pre-tax impairment charges of $ 42 million, primarily related to a coconut water brand in PBNA. For further information on our policies for indefinite-lived intangible assets, see Note 2. 79 Table of Contents The change in the book value of indefinite-lived intangible assets is as follows: Balance, Beginning 2021 Acquisitions/(Divestitures) Translation and Other Balance, End of 2021 Acquisitions/(Divestitures) Impairment Translation and Other Balance, End of 2022 FLNA (a) Goodwill $ 465 $ ( 8 ) $ 1 $ 458 $ — $ — $ ( 7 ) $ 451 Brands 340 — — 340 — ( 88 ) ( 1 ) 251 Total 805 ( 8 ) 1 798 — ( 88 ) ( 8 ) 702 QFNA Goodwill 189 — — 189 — — — 189 Brands — — — — — — — — Total 189 — — 189 — — — 189 PBNA (b) Goodwill 12,189 ( 216 ) 1 11,974 — — ( 27 ) 11,947 Reacquired franchise rights 7,107 — — 7,107 — — ( 46 ) 7,061 Acquired franchise rights 1,536 1 1 1,538 230 — ( 10 ) 1,758 Brands (c) 3,122 ( 290 ) ( 324 ) 2,508 — — — 2,508 Total 23,954 ( 505 ) ( 322 ) 23,127 230 — ( 83 ) 23,274 LatAm Goodwill 458 — ( 25 ) 433 — — 3 436 Brands (d) 108 ( 1 ) ( 7 ) 100 — ( 29 ) 4 75 Total 566 ( 1 ) ( 32 ) 533 — ( 29 ) 7 511 Europe (e) Goodwill (f) 3,806 ( 28 ) ( 78 ) 3,700 — — ( 54 ) 3,646 Reacquired franchise rights (f) 496 ( 23 ) ( 32 ) 441 — — ( 20 ) 421 Acquired franchise rights (f) 172 — ( 14 ) 158 — ( 1 ) ( 9 ) 148 Brands (g) (h) 4,072 — 182 4,254 — ( 2,684 ) 94 1,664 Total 8,546 ( 51 ) 58 8,553 — ( 2,685 ) 11 5,879 AMESA Goodwill 1,096 ( 2 ) ( 31 ) 1,063 14 — ( 62 ) 1,015 Brands (i) 214 — ( 9 ) 205 — ( 36 ) ( 13 ) 156 Total 1,310 ( 2 ) ( 40 ) 1,268 14 ( 36 ) ( 75 ) 1,171 APAC Goodwill 554 3 7 564 — — ( 46 ) 518 Brands (c) (j) 445 — 31 476 — ( 172 ) ( 37 ) 267 Total 999 3 38 1,040 — ( 172 ) ( 83 ) 785 Total goodwill 18,757 ( 251 ) ( 125 ) 18,381 14 — ( 193 ) 18,202 Total reacquired franchise rights 7,603 ( 23 ) ( 32 ) 7,548 — — ( 66 ) 7,482 Total acquired franchise rights 1,708 1 ( 13 ) 1,696 230 ( 1 ) ( 19 ) 1,906 Total brands 8,301 ( 291 ) ( 127 ) 7,883 — ( 3,009 ) 47 4,921 Total $ 36,369 $ ( 564 ) $ ( 297 ) $ 35,508 $ 244 $ ( 3,010 ) $ ( 231 ) $ 32,511 (a) Acquisitions/divestitures in 2021 primarily reflect purchase price allocation adjustments related to our acquisition of BFY Brands, Inc.

Note 5 — Income Taxes The components of income before income taxes are as follows: 2022 2021 2020 United States $ 7,305 $ 3,740 $ 4,070 Foreign 3,400 6,081 4,999 $ 10,705 $ 9,821 $ 9,069 The provision for income taxes consisted of the following: 2022 2021 2020 Current: U.S. Federal $ 1,137 $ 702 $ 715 Foreign 1,027 955 932 State 246 44 110 2,410 1,701 1,757 Deferred: U.S. Federal 22 375 273 Foreign ( 709 ) ( 14 ) ( 167 ) State 4 80 31 ( 683 ) 441 137 $ 1,727 $ 2,142 $ 1,894 A reconciliation of the U.S. Federal statutory tax rate to our annual tax rate is as follows: 2022 2021 2020 U.S. Federal statutory tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 % State income tax, net of U.S. Federal tax benefit 1.8 1.0 1.2 Lower taxes on foreign results ( 1.5 ) ( 1.6 ) ( 0.8 ) One-time mandatory transition tax - TCJ Act 0.8 1.9 — Juice Transaction ( 2.4 ) — — Tax settlements ( 3.0 ) — — Other, net ( 0.6 ) ( 0.5 ) ( 0.5 ) Annual tax rate 16.1 % 21.8 % 20.9 % Tax Cuts and Jobs Act In 2022, we recorded $ 86 million ($ 0.06 per share) of net tax expense related to the TCJ Act as a result of correlating adjustments related to a partial audit settlement with the IRS for tax years 2014 through 2019. In 2021, we recorded $ 190 million ($ 0.14 per share) of net tax expense related to the TCJ Act as a result of adjustments related to the final assessment of the 2014 through 2016 IRS audit . There were no tax amounts recognized in 2020 related to the TCJ Act. 81 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2022, our mandatory transition tax liability was $ 2.6 billion, which must be paid through 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act. We reduced our liability through cash payments and application of tax overpayments by $ 309 million in 2022, $ 309 million in 2021 and $ 78 million in 2020. We currently expect to pay approximately $ 309 million of this liability in 2023. The TCJ Act also created a requirement that certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries, known as global intangible low-tax income (GILTI), must be included in the gross income of their U.S. shareholder. The FASB allows an accounting policy election of either recognizing deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or recognizing such taxes as a current-period expense when incurred. We elected to treat the tax effect of GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred. Other Tax Matters In 2021, we received a final assessment from the IRS audit for the tax years 2014 through 2016. The assessment included both agreed and unagreed issues. On October 29, 2021, we filed a formal written protest of the assessment and requested an appeals conference. As a result of the analysis of the 2014 through 2016 final assessment, we remeasured all applicable reserves for uncertain tax positions for all years open under the statute of limitations, including any correlating adjustments impacting the mandatory transition tax liability under the TCJ Act, resulting in a net non-cash tax expense of $ 112 million ($ 0.08 per share) in 2021. In 2022 , we came to an agreement with the IRS to settle one of the issues assessed in the 2014 through 2016 tax audit. The agreement covers tax years 2014 through 2019. As a result, we reduced our reserves for uncertain tax positions, including any correlating adjustments impacting the mandatory transition tax liability under the TCJ Act, resulting in a net non-cash tax benefit of $ 233 million ($ 0.17 per share) in 2022 . Tax years 2014 through 2019 remain under audit for other issues. On August 16, 2022, the “Inflation Reduction Act” (H.R. 5376) was signed into law in the United States. We do not currently expect the Inflation Reduction Act to have a material impact on our financial results, including on our annual estimated effective tax rate or on our liquidity. On May 19, 2019, a public referendum held in Switzerland passed the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (TRAF), effective January 1, 2020. The enactment of certain provisions of the TRAF resulted in adjustments to our deferred taxes. During 2020, we recorded a net tax benefit of $ 72 million ($ 0.05 per share) related to the adoption of the TRAF in the Swiss Canton of Bern. 82 Table of Contents Deferred tax liabilities and assets are comprised of the following: 2022 2021 Deferred tax liabilities Debt guarantee of wholly-owned subsidiary $ 578 $ 578 Property, plant and equipment 2,126 2,036 Recapture of net operating losses 492 504 Pension liabilities 189 216 Right-of-use assets 534 450 Investment in TBG 186 — Other 232 254 Gross deferred tax liabilities 4,337 4,038 Deferred tax assets Net carryforwards 5,342 4,974 Intangible assets other than nondeductible goodwill 1,614 1,111 Share-based compensation 120 98 Retiree medical benefits 118 147 Other employee-related benefits 349 379 Deductible state tax and interest benefits 144 149 Lease liabilities 534 450 Capitalized research and development 150 — Other 1,050 842 Gross deferred tax assets 9,421 8,150 Valuation allowances ( 5,013 ) ( 4,628 ) Deferred tax assets, net 4,408 3,522 Net deferred tax (assets)/liabilities $ ( 71 ) $ 516 A summary of our valuation allowance activity is as follows: 2022 2021 2020 Balance, beginning of year $ 4,628 $ 4,686 $ 3,599 Provision 492 ( 9 ) 1,082 Other (deductions)/additions ( 107 ) ( 49 ) 5 Balance, end of year $ 5,013 $ 4,628 $ 4,686 83 Table of Contents Reserves A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. Our major taxing jurisdictions and the related open tax audits are as follows: Jurisdiction Years Open to Audit Years Currently Under Audit United States 2014-2021 2014-2019 Mexico 2014-2021 2014-2017 United Kingdom 2020-2021 None Canada (Domestic) 2016-2021 2016-2019 Canada (International) 2010-2021 2010-2019 Russia 2019-2021 None Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning strategies and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we likely will not succeed. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit, new tax laws, relevant court cases or tax authority settlements. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate in the year of resolution. As of December 31, 2022, the total gross amount of reserves for income taxes, reported in other liabilities, was $ 1.9 billion. We accrue interest related to reserves for income taxes in our provision for income taxes and any associated penalties are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. The gross amount of interest accrued, reported in other liabilities, was $ 292 million as of December 31, 2022, of which $ 4 million of tax benefit was recognized in 2022. The gross amount of interest accrued, reported in other liabilities, was $ 326 million as of December 25, 2021, of which $ 3 million of tax benefit was recognized in 2021. A reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: 2022 2021 Balance, beginning of year $ 1,900 $ 1,621 Additions for tax positions related to the current year 228 222 Additions for tax positions from prior years 206 681 Reductions for tax positions from prior years ( 357 ) ( 558 ) Settlement payments ( 53 ) ( 25 ) Statutes of limitations expiration ( 36 ) ( 39 ) Translation and other ( 21 ) ( 2 ) Balance, end of year $ 1,867 $ 1,900 Carryforwards and Allowances Operating loss carryforwards totaling $ 32.2 billion as of December 31, 2022 are being carried forward in a number of foreign and state jurisdictions where we are permitted to use tax operating losses from prior periods to reduce future taxable income. These operating losses will expire as follows: $ 0.2 billion in 2023, $ 27.6 billion between 2024 and 2041 and $ 4.4 billion may be carried forward indefinitely. We 84 Table of Contents establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is not more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. Undistributed International Earnings As of December 31, 2022, we had approximately $ 9 billion of undistributed international earnings. We intend to continue to reinvest $ 9 billion of earnings outside the United States for the foreseeable future and while future distribution of these earnings would not be subject to U.S. federal tax expense, no deferred tax liabilities with respect to items such as certain foreign exchange gains or losses, foreign withholding taxes or state taxes have been recognized. It is not practicable for us to determine the amount of unrecognized tax expense on these reinvested international earnings. Note 6 — Share-Based Compensation Our share-based compensation program is designed to attract and retain employees while also aligning employees’ interests with the interests of our shareholders. PepsiCo has granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs and long-term cash awards to employees under the shareholder-approved PepsiCo, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). Executives who are awarded long-term incentives based on their performance may generally elect to receive their grant in the form of stock options or RSUs, or a combination thereof. Executives who elect stock options receive four stock options for every one RSU that would have otherwise been granted. Certain executive officers and other senior executives do not have a choice and are granted 66 % PSUs and 34 % long-term cash, each of which are subject to pre-established performance targets. The Company may use authorized and unissued shares to meet share requirements resulting from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of RSUs and PSUs. As of December 31, 2022, 37 million shares were available for future share-based compensation grants under the LTIP. The following table summarizes our total share-based compensation expense, which is primarily recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, and excess tax benefits recognized: 2022 2021 2020 Share-based compensation expense - equity awards $ 343 $ 301 $ 264 Share-based compensation expense - liability awards 30 20 11 Acquisition and divestiture-related charges 3 — — Restructuring charges — 1 ( 1 ) Total $ 376 $ 322 $ 274 Income tax benefits recognized in earnings related to share-based compensation $ 62 $ 57 $ 48 Excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation $ 44 $ 38 $ 35 As of December 31, 2022, there was $ 396 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation grants. This unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of two years . Method of Accounting and Our Assumptions The fair value of share-based award grants is amortized to expense over the vesting period, primarily three years . Awards to employees eligible for retirement prior to the award becoming fully vested are amortized to expense over the period through the date that the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide service to earn the award. In addition, we use historical data to estimate 85 Table of Contents forfeiture rates and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. We do not backdate, reprice or grant share-based compensation awards retroactively. Repricing of awards would require shareholder approval under the LTIP. Stock Options A stock option permits the holder to purchase shares of PepsiCo common stock at a specified price. We account for our employee stock options under the fair value method of accounting using a Black-Scholes valuation model to measure stock option expense at the date of grant. All stock option grants have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and generally have a 10 -year term. Our weighted-average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions are as follows: 2022 2021 2020 Expected life 7 years 7 years 6 years Risk-free interest rate 1.9 % 1.1 % 0.9 % Expected volatility 16 % 14 % 14 % Expected dividend yield 2.5 % 3.1 % 3.4 % The expected life is the period over which our employee groups are expected to hold their options. It is based on our historical experience with similar grants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the expected U.S. Treasury rate over the expected life. Volatility reflects movements in our stock price over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life. Dividend yield is estimated over the expected life based on our stated dividend policy and forecasts of net income, share repurchases and stock price. A summary of our stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2022 is as follows: Options (a) Weighted-Average Exercise Price Weighted-Average Contractual Life Remaining (years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (a) Outstanding at December 25, 2021 10,142 $ 110.54 Granted 2,422 $ 163.54 Exercised ( 1,578 ) $ 87.33 Forfeited/expired ( 482 ) $ 146.13 Outstanding at December 31, 2022 10,504 $ 124.63 6.08 $ 588,549 Exercisable at December 31, 2022 4,892 $ 101.02 3.50 $ 389,547 Expected to vest as of December 31, 2022 5,267 $ 144.58 8.29 $ 190,040 (a) In thousands. 86 Table of Contents Restricted Stock Units and Performance Stock Units Each RSU represents our obligation to deliver to the holder one share of PepsiCo common stock when the award vests at the end of the service period. PSUs are awards pursuant to which a number of shares are delivered to the holder upon vesting at the end of the service period based on PepsiCo’s performance against specified financial performance metrics. The number of shares may be increased to the maximum or reduced to the minimum threshold based on the results of these performance metrics in accordance with the terms established at the time of the award. During the vesting period, RSUs and PSUs accrue dividend equivalents that pay out in cash (without interest) if and when the applicable RSU or PSU vests and becomes payable. The fair value of RSUs and PSUs are measured at the market price of the Company’s stock on the date of grant. A summary of our RSU and PSU activity for the year ended December 31, 2022 is as follows: RSUs/PSUs (a) Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value Weighted-Average Contractual Life Remaining (years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (a) Outstanding at December 25, 2021 5,977 $ 127.45 Granted 2,263 $ 163.02 Converted ( 2,051 ) $ 120.03 Forfeited ( 475 ) $ 141.64 Outstanding at December 31, 2022 (b) 5,714 $ 143.02 1.24 $ 1,032,222 Expected to vest as of December 31, 2022 (c) 5,979 $ 141.94 1.17 $ 1,080,138 (a) In thousands.

(b) The outstanding PSUs for which the vesting period has not ended as of December 31, 2022, at the threshold, target and maximum award levels were zero , 1 million and 2 million, respectively. (c) Represents the number of outstanding awards expected to vest, including estimated performance adjustments on all outstanding PSUs as of December 31, 2022. Long-Term Cash Certain executive officers and other senior executives were granted long-term cash awards for which final payout is based on PepsiCo’s Total Shareholder Return relative to a specific set of peer companies and achievement of a specified performance target over a three-year performance period. Long-term cash awards that qualify as liability awards under share-based compensation guidance are valued through the end of the performance period on a mark-to-market basis using the Monte Carlo simulation model. 87 Table of Contents A summary of our long-term cash activity for the year ended December 31, 2022 is as follows: Long-Term Cash Award (a) Balance Sheet Date Fair Value (b) Contractual Life Remaining (years) Outstanding at December 25, 2021 $ 45,792 Granted 18,182 Vested ( 11,364 ) Forfeited ( 2,356 ) Outstanding at December 31, 2022 (c) $ 50,254 $ 68,167 1.17 Expected to vest as of December 31, 2022 $ 46,841 $ 65,835 1.15 (a) In thousands, disclosed at target.

As of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, there were approximately 307,000 and 299,000 outstanding awards, respectively, consisting primarily of phantom stock units that were granted under the PepsiCo Director Deferral Program and will be settled in shares of PepsiCo common stock pursuant to the LTIP at the end of the applicable deferral period, not included in the tables above. Note 7 — Pension, Retiree Medical and Savings Plans Effective December 31, 2022, we merged two U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans, PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan I (Plan I), mostly inactive participants, and PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan A (Plan A), mostly active participants, with Plan I remaining. The accrued benefits offered to the plans’ participants were unchanged. The merger was made to provide additional flexibility in evaluating opportunities to reduce risk and volatility. Actuarial gains and losses of the merged plan will be amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of participants. There is no material impact to pre-tax pension benefits expense from this merger. In 2022, we transferred pension and retiree medical obligations of $ 145 million and related assets to TBG in connection with the Juice Transaction. See Note 13 for further information. 88 Table of Contents In 2021, we adopted a change to the Canadian defined benefit plans to freeze pension accruals for salaried participants, effective January 1, 2024, and to close the hourly plan to new non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2022. After the effective date, all salaried participants receive an employer contribution to the defined contribution plan based on age and years of service regardless of employee contribution and the opportunity to receive employer contributions to match employee contributions up to defined limits. We also adopted a change to the U.K. defined benefit plan to freeze pension accruals for all participants effective March 31, 2022. After the effective date, participants have the opportunity to receive employer contributions to match employee contributions up to defined limits. Pre-tax pension benefits expense will decrease after the effective dates, partially offset by contributions to defined contribution plans. In 2021, we adopted a change to the U.S. qualified defined benefit plans to transfer certain participants from Plan A to Plan I, effective January 1, 2022. The accrued benefits offered to the plans’ participants were unchanged. There was no material impact to pre-tax pension benefits expense from this transaction. In 2020, we adopted an amendment to the U.S. defined benefit pension plans to freeze benefit accruals for salaried participants, effective December 31, 2025. Since 2011, salaried new hires are not eligible to participate in the defined benefit plan. After the effective date, all salaried participants receive an employer contribution to the 401(k) savings plan based on age and years of service regardless of employee contribution and the opportunity to receive employer contributions to match employee contributions up to defined limits. As a result of this amendment, pre-tax pension benefits expense decreased $ 70 million in 2021, primarily impacting corporate unallocated expenses. In 2020, we approved an amendment to reorganize the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans that resulted in the transfer of certain participants from Plan A to Plan I and to a newly created plan, PepsiCo Employees Retirement Hourly Plan (Plan H), effective January 1, 2021. The accrued benefits offered to the plans’ participants were unchanged. The reorganization facilitated a more targeted investment strategy and provided additional flexibility in evaluating opportunities to reduce risk and volatility. There was no material impact to pre-tax pension benefits expense as a result of this reorganization. In 2020, we adopted an amendment, effective January 1, 2021, to enhance the pay credit benefits of certain participants in Plan H. As a result of this amendment, pre-tax pension benefits expense increased $ 45 million in 2021, primarily impacting service cost expense. Gains and losses resulting from actual experience differing from our assumptions, including the difference between the actual and expected return on plan assets, as well as changes in our assumptions, are determined at each measurement date. These differences are recognized as a component of net gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders’ equity. If this net accumulated gain or loss exceeds 10 % of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or plan obligations, a portion of the net gain or loss is included in other pension and retiree medical benefits (expense)/income for the following year based upon the average remaining service life for participants in Plan A (approximately 9 years), Plan H (approximately 11 years) and retiree medical (approximately 9 years), and the remaining life expectancy for participants in Plan I (approximately 27 years). In 2023, we expect the average remaining service life for participants in Plan H to be approximately 11 years and the average remaining life expectancy for participants in Plan I to be approximately 26 years. The cost or benefit of plan changes that increase or decrease benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost/(credit)) is included in other pension and retiree medical benefits (expense)/income on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service life for participants in Plan H, and the remaining life expectancy for participants in Plan I, except that prior service cost/(credit) for salaried participants subject to the freeze is amortized on a straight-line basis over the period up to the effective date of the freeze. 89 Table of Contents Selected financial information for our pension and retiree medical plans is as follows: Pension Retiree Medical U.S. International 2022 2021 2022 2021 2022 2021 Change in projected benefit obligation Obligation at beginning of year $ 16,216 $ 16,753 $ 4,175 $ 4,430 $ 954 $ 1,006 Service cost 487 518 64 104 37 33 Interest cost 434 324 90 74 19 15 Plan amendments 10 23 — 3 — — Participant contributions — — 2 3 — — Experience gain ( 3,989 ) ( 215 ) ( 1,284 ) ( 178 ) ( 198 ) ( 17 ) Benefit payments ( 412 ) ( 976 ) ( 127 ) ( 106 ) ( 81 ) ( 83 ) Settlement/curtailment ( 1,109 ) ( 220 ) ( 5 ) ( 99 ) ( 14 ) — Special termination benefits 37 9 — — — — Other, including foreign currency adjustment ( 131 ) — ( 312 ) ( 56 ) ( 3 ) — Obligation at end of year $ 11,543 $ 16,216 $ 2,603 $ 4,175 $ 714 $ 954 Change in fair value of plan assets Fair value at beginning of year $ 15,904 $ 15,465 $ 4,624 $ 4,303 $ 299 $ 315 Actual return on plan assets ( 3,337 ) 1,052 ( 1,026 ) 387 ( 68 ) 20 Employer contributions/funding 235 580 101 158 48 47 Participant contributions — — 2 3 — — Benefit payments ( 412 ) ( 976 ) ( 127 ) ( 106 ) ( 81 ) ( 83 ) Settlement ( 1,117 ) ( 217 ) ( 5 ) ( 52 ) — — Other, including foreign currency adjustment ( 125 ) — ( 374 ) ( 69 ) ( 2 ) — Fair value at end of year $ 11,148 $ 15,904 $ 3,195 $ 4,624 $ 196 $ 299 Funded status $ ( 395 ) $ ( 312 ) $ 592 $ 449 $ ( 518 ) $ ( 655 ) Amounts recognized Other assets $ 225 $ 692 $ 708 $ 564 $ — $ — Other current liabilities ( 56 ) ( 48 ) ( 7 ) ( 1 ) ( 54 ) ( 57 ) Other liabilities ( 564 ) ( 956 ) ( 109 ) ( 114 ) ( 464 ) ( 598 ) Net amount recognized $ ( 395 ) $ ( 312 ) $ 592 $ 449 $ ( 518 ) $ ( 655 ) Amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive loss (pre-tax) Net loss/(gain) $ 3,337 $ 3,550 $ 571 $ 696 $ ( 320 ) $ ( 220 ) Prior service credit ( 21 ) ( 63 ) ( 9 ) ( 11 ) ( 25 ) ( 34 ) Total $ 3,316 $ 3,487 $ 562 $ 685 $ ( 345 ) $ ( 254 ) Changes recognized in net (gain)/loss included in other comprehensive loss Net loss/(gain) arising in current year $ 254 $ ( 301 ) $ ( 40 ) $ ( 355 ) $ ( 114 ) $ ( 22 ) Amortization and settlement recognition ( 467 ) ( 265 ) ( 30 ) ( 95 ) 14 14 Foreign currency translation gain — — ( 55 ) ( 3 ) — — Total $ ( 213 ) $ ( 566 ) $ ( 125 ) $ ( 453 ) $ ( 100 ) $ ( 8 ) Accumulated benefit obligation at end of year $ 11,104 $ 15,489 $ 2,483 $ 4,021 The net loss arising in the current year is primarily attributable to a decrease in the actual return on plan assets offset by the impact of higher discount rates. The amount we report in operating profit as pension and retiree medical cost is service cost, which is the 90 Table of Contents value of benefits earned by employees for working during the year. The amounts we report below operating profit as pension and retiree medical cost consist of the following components: • Interest cost is the accrued interest on the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time. • Expected return on plan assets is the long-term return we expect to earn on plan investments for our funded plans that will be used to settle future benefit obligations. • Amortization of prior service cost/(credit) represents the recognition in the income statement of benefit changes resulting from plan amendments. • Amortization of net loss/(gain) represents the recognition in the income statement of changes in the amount of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation based on changes in assumptions and actual experience. • Settlement/curtailment loss/(gain) represents the result of actions that effectively eliminate all or a portion of related projected benefit obligations. Settlements are triggered when payouts to settle the projected benefit obligation of a plan due to lump sums or other events exceed the total of annual service and interest cost. Settlements are recognized when actions are irrevocable and we are relieved of the primary responsibility and risk for projected benefit obligations. Lump sum payouts are generally higher when interest rates are lower. Curtailments are recognized when events such as plant closures, the sale of a business, or plan changes result in a significant reduction of future service or benefits. Curtailment losses are recognized when an event is probable and estimable, while curtailment gains are recognized when an event has occurred (when the related employees terminate or an amendment is adopted). • Special termination benefits are the additional benefits offered to employees upon departure due to actions such as restructuring. The components of total pension and retiree medical benefit costs are as follows: Pension Retiree Medical U.S. International 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 Service cost $ 487 $ 518 $ 434 $ 64 $ 104 $ 86 $ 37 $ 33 $ 25 Other pension and retiree medical benefits (income)/expense: Interest cost $ 434 $ 324 $ 435 $ 90 $ 74 $ 85 $ 19 $ 15 $ 25 Expected return on plan assets ( 912 ) ( 970 ) ( 929 ) ( 218 ) ( 231 ) ( 202 ) ( 16 ) ( 15 ) ( 16 ) Amortization of prior service (credit)/cost ( 28 ) ( 31 ) 12 ( 1 ) ( 2 ) — ( 8 ) ( 11 ) ( 12 ) Amortization of net losses/(gains) 149 224 196 29 77 61 ( 14 ) ( 14 ) ( 23 ) Settlement/curtailment losses/(gains) (a) 322 40 213 1 ( 11 ) 19 ( 16 ) — — Special termination benefits 37 9 19 — — — — — — Total other pension and retiree medical benefits (income)/expense $ 2 $ ( 404 ) $ ( 54 ) $ ( 99 ) $ ( 93 ) $ ( 37 ) $ ( 35 ) $ ( 25 ) $ ( 26 ) Total $ 489 $ 114 $ 380 $ ( 35 ) $ 11 $ 49 $ 2 $ 8 $ ( 1 ) (a) In 2022 and 2020, U.S. includes a settlement charge of $ 318 million ($ 246 million after-tax or $ 0.18 per share) and $ 205 million ($ 158 million after-tax or $ 0.11 per share), respectively, related to lump sum distributions exceeding the total of annual service and interest cost. 91 Table of Contents The following table provides the weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost and projected benefit obligation for our pension and retiree medical plans: Pension Retiree Medical U.S. International 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 Net Periodic Benefit Cost Service cost discount rate (a) 3.1 % 2.6 % 3.4 % 4.2 % 2.7 % 3.2 % 2.8 % 2.3 % 3.2 % Interest cost discount rate (a) 3.1 % 2.0 % 2.9 % 2.3 % 1.7 % 2.4 % 2.1 % 1.6 % 2.6 % Expected return on plan assets (a) 6.7 % 6.4 % 6.8 % 5.3 % 5.3 % 5.6 % 5.7 % 5.4 % 5.8 % Rate of salary increases 3.0 % 3.0 % 3.1 % 3.3 % 3.3 % 3.3 % Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate 5.4 % 2.9 % 2.5 % 5.3 % 2.4 % 2.0 % 5.4 % 2.7 % 2.3 % Rate of salary increases 3.2 % 3.0 % 3.0 % 4.2 % 3.3 % 3.3 % (a) 2022 U.S. rates reflect remeasurement of a U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plan in the second quarter of 2022.

Future Benefit Payments Our estimated future benefit payments are as follows: 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 - 2032 Pension $ 945 $ 1,070 $ 910 $ 955 $ 975 $ 5,100 Retiree medical (a) $ 90 $ 85 $ 80 $ 80 $ 75 $ 330 (a) Expected future benefit payments for our retiree medical plans do not reflect any estimated subsidies expected to be received under the 2003 Medicare Act. Subsidies are expected to be approximately $ 1 million for each of the years from 2023 through 2027 and approximately $ 3 million in total for 2028 through 2032. These future benefit payments to beneficiaries include payments from both funded and unfunded plans. 92 Table of Contents Funding Contributions to our pension and retiree medical plans were as follows: Pension Retiree Medical 2022 2021 2020 2022 2021 2020 Discretionary (a) $ 160 $ 525 $ 339 $ — $ — $ — Non-discretionary 176 213 168 48 47 55 Total $ 336 $ 738 $ 507 $ 48 $ 47 $ 55 (a) Includes $ 150 million contribution in 2022, $ 500 million contribution in 2021 and $ 325 million contribution in 2020 to fund our U.S. qualified defined benefit plans. We made a discretionary contribution of $ 125 million to a U.S. qualified defined benefit plan in January 2023 and expect to make an additional contribution of $ 125 million in the third quarter of 2023. In addition, in 2023, we expect to make non-discretionary contributions of approximately $ 90 million to our U.S. and international pension benefit plans and contributions of approximately $ 55 million for retiree medical benefits. We also regularly evaluate opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans. Plan Assets Our pension plan investment strategy includes the use of actively managed accounts and is reviewed periodically in conjunction with plan obligations, an evaluation of market conditions, tolerance for risk and cash requirements for benefit payments. This strategy is also applicable to funds held for the retiree medical plans. Our investment objective includes ensuring that funds are available to meet the plans’ benefit obligations when they become due. Assets contributed to our pension plans are no longer controlled by us, but become the property of our individual pension plans. However, we are indirectly impacted by changes in these plan assets as compared to changes in our projected obligations. Our overall investment policy is to prudently invest plan assets in a well-diversified portfolio of equity and high-quality debt securities and real estate to achieve our long-term return expectations. Our investment policy also permits the use of derivative instruments, such as futures and forward contracts, to reduce interest rate and foreign currency risks. Futures contracts represent commitments to purchase or sell securities at a future date and at a specified price. Forward contracts consist of currency forwards. For 2023 and 2022, our expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets is 7.4 % and 6.7 %, respectively. Our target investment allocations for U.S. plan assets for both 2023 and 2022 are as follows: Fixed income 56 % U.S. equity 22 % International equity 18 % Real estate 4 % Actual investment allocations may vary from our target investment allocations due to prevailing market conditions. We regularly review our actual investment allocations and periodically rebalance our investments. The expected return on plan assets is based on our investment strategy and our expectations for long-term rates of return by asset class, taking into account volatility and correlation among asset classes and our historical experience. We also review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of the long-term rates. We evaluate our expected return assumptions annually to ensure that they are reasonable. To calculate the expected return on plan assets, our market-related value of assets for fixed income is the actual fair value. For all other asset categories, such as equity securities, we use a 93 Table of Contents method that recognizes investment gains or losses (the difference between the expected and actual return based on the market-related value of assets) over a five -year period. This has the effect of reducing year-to-year volatility. Plan assets measured at fair value as of year-end 2022 and 2021 are categorized consistently by Level 1 (quoted prices in active markets for identical assets), Level 2 (significant other observable inputs) and Level 3 (significant unobservable inputs) in both years and are as follows: Fair Value Hierarchy Level 2022 2021 U.S. plan assets (a) Equity securities, including preferred stock (b) 1 $ 4,387 $ 6,387 Government securities (c) 2 1,751 2,523 Corporate bonds (c) 2 4,245 6,210 Mortgage-backed securities (c) 2 142 199 Contracts with insurance companies (d) 3 9 9 Cash and cash equivalents (e) 1, 2 157 352 Sub-total U.S. plan assets 10,691 15,680 Real estate commingled funds measured at net asset value (f) 533 478 Dividends and interest receivable, net of payables 120 45 Total U.S. plan assets $ 11,344 $ 16,203 International plan assets Equity securities (b) 1 $ 1,291 $ 2,232 Government securities (c) 2 736 1,053 Corporate bonds (c) 2 254 400 Fixed income commingled funds (g) 1 628 632 Contracts with insurance companies (d) 3 27 43 Cash and cash equivalents 1 75 34 Sub-total international plan assets 3,011 4,394 Real estate commingled funds measured at net asset value (f) 173 221 Dividends and interest receivable 11 9 Total international plan assets $ 3,195 $ 4,624 (a) Includes $ 196 million and $ 299 million in 2022 and 2021, respectively, of retiree medical plan assets that are restricted for purposes of providing health benefits for U.S. retirees and their beneficiaries. (b) Invested in U.S. and international common stock and commingled funds, and the preferred stock portfolio was invested in domestic and international corporate preferred stock investments. The common and preferred stock investments are based on quoted prices in active markets. The commingled funds are based on the published price of the fund and include one large-cap fund that represents 10 % and 11 % of total U.S. plan assets for 2022 and 2021, respectively. (c) These investments are based on quoted bid prices for comparable securities in the marketplace and broker/dealer quotes in active markets. Corporate bonds of U.S.-based companies represents 32 % of total U.S. plan assets for 2022 and 2021. (d) Based on the fair value of the contracts as determined by the insurance companies using inputs that are not observable. The changes in Level 3 amounts were not significant in the years ended December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021. (e) Includes Level 1 assets of $ 216 million for 2021 and Level 2 assets of $ 157 million and $ 136 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively. (f) The real estate commingled funds include investments in limited partnerships. These funds are based on the net asset value of the appraised value of investments owned by these funds as determined by independent third parties using inputs that are not observable. The majority of the funds are redeemable quarterly subject to availability of cash and have notice periods ranging from 45 to 90 days. (g) Based on the published price of the fund. 94 Table of Contents Retiree Medical Cost Trend Rates The assumed health care cost trend rates are as follows: 2023 2022 Average increase assumed 6 % 6 % Ultimate projected increase 4 % 4 % Year of ultimate projected increase 2046 2046 These assumed health care cost trend rates have an impact on the retiree medical plan expense and obligation, however the cap on our share of retiree medical costs limits the impact. Savings Plan Certain U.S. employees are eligible to participate in a 401(k) savings plan, which is a voluntary defined contribution plan. The plan is designed to help employees accumulate savings for retirement and we make Company matching contributions for certain employees on a portion of employee contributions based on years of service. Certain U.S. salaried employees, who are not eligible to participate in a defined benefit pension plan, are also eligible to receive an employer contribution based on age and years of service regardless of employee contribution. In 2022, 2021 and 2020, our total Company contributions were $ 283 million, $ 246 million and $ 225 million, respectively. Note 8 — Debt Obligations The following table summarizes our debt obligations: 2022 (a) 2021 (a) Short-term debt obligations (b) Current maturities of long-term debt $ 3,096 $ 3,872 Commercial paper ( 0.1 % and 0.1 %) — 400 Other borrowings ( 15.0 % and 2.2 %) 318 36 $ 3,414 $ 4,308 Long-term debt obligations (b) Notes due 2022 ( 2.4 %) $ — $ 3,868 Notes due 2023 ( 1.7 % and 1.5 %) 3,094 3,019 Notes due 2024 ( 2.2 % and 2.1 %) 2,867 2,986 Notes due 2025 ( 2.7 % and 2.7 %) 3,193 3,230 Notes due 2026 ( 3.1 % and 3.2 %) 2,396 2,450 Notes due 2027 ( 2.5 % and 2.4 % ) 2,523 2,554 Notes due 2028-2060 ( 2.8 % and 2.6 %) 24,652 21,759 Other, due 2022-2028 ( 1.3 % and 1.3 %) 28 32 38,753 39,898 Less: current maturities of long-term debt obligations 3,096 3,872 Total $ 35,657 $ 36,026 (a) Amounts are shown net of unamortized net discounts of $ 227 million and $ 233 million for 2022 and 2021, respectively. (b) The interest rates presented reflect weighted-average effective interest rates at year-end. See Note 9 for further information regarding our interest rate derivative instruments. As of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, our international debt of $ 304 million and $ 38 million, respectively, was related to borrowings from external parties, including various lines of credit. These lines 95 Table of Contents of credit are subject to normal banking terms and conditions and are fully committed at least to the extent of our borrowings. In 2022, we issued the following senior notes: Interest Rate Maturity Date Principal Amount (a) 3.200 % July 2029 £ 300 (b) 3.550 % July 2034 £ 450 (b) 3.600 % February 2028 $ 750 3.900 % July 2032 $ 1,250 4.200 % July 2052 $ 500 (a) Excludes debt issuance costs, discounts and premiums. (b) These notes, issued in British pounds, were designated as net investment hedges to partially offset the effects of foreign currency on our investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries. The net proceeds from the issuances of the above notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper, except for an amount equivalent to the net proceeds from our 3.900 % senior notes due 2032 that will be allocated to fund, in whole or in part, eligible green projects in the categories of investments in recycling and sustainable plastics and packaging, decarbonizing our operations and supply chain, water sustainability, and regenerative agriculture, which promote our selected Sustainable Development Goals, as defined by the United Nations. In 2022, we entered into a new five-year unsecured revolving credit agreement (Five-Year Credit Agreement), which expires on May 27, 2027. The Five-Year Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $ 3.8 billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros, including a $ 0.75 billion swing line subfacility for euro-denominated borrowings permitted to be borrowed on a same-day basis, subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $ 4.5 billion (or the equivalent amount in euros). Additionally, we may, once a year, request renewal of the agreement for an additional one-year period. The Five-Year Credit Agreement replaced our $ 3.75 billion five-year credit agreement, dated as of May 28, 2021. Also in 2022, we entered into a new 364-day unsecured revolving credit agreement (364-Day Credit Agreement), which expires on May 26, 2023. The 364-Day Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $ 3.8 billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros, subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $ 4.5 billion (or the equivalent amount in euros). We may request renewal of this facility for an additional 364-day period or convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year, which term loan would mature no later than the anniversary of the then effective termination date. The 364-Day Credit Agreement replaced our $ 3.75 billion 364-day credit agreement, dated as of May 28, 2021. Funds borrowed under the Five-Year Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. Subject to certain conditions, we may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts under these agreements. As of December 31, 2022, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Five-Year Credit Agreement or the 364-Day Credit Agreement. 96 Table of Contents In 2022, we paid $ 750 million to redeem all $ 750 million outstanding principal amount of our 2.25 % senior notes due May 2022, we paid $ 800 million to redeem all $ 800 million outstanding principal amount of our 3.10 % senior notes due July 2022 and we paid $ 154 million to redeem all $ 133 million outstanding principal amount of our subsidiary, Pepsi-Cola Metropolitan Bottling Company, Inc.’s 7.00 % senior notes due March 2029 and 5.50 % notes due May 2035. Additionally, we deposited $ 102 million of U.S. government securities with the Bank of New York Mellon, as trustee, in legal defeasance of $ 94 million outstanding principal amount of certain notes originally issued by our subsidiary, The Quaker Oats Company (Quaker notes). PepsiCo will be deemed to have paid and discharged the Quaker notes on April 12, 2023. In 2021, we completed cash tender offers to redeem $ 4.1 billion principal amount of certain notes, with maturity dates ranging from May 2035 to March 2060 and interest rates ranging from 3.375 % to 5.500 %, for $ 4.8 billion in cash. As a result of the cash tender offers, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $ 842 million ($ 677 million after-tax or $ 0.49 per share) to net interest expense and other, primarily representing the tender price paid over the carrying value of the tendered notes and loss on treasury rate locks used to mitigate the interest rate risk on the cash tender offers. Also in 2021, we paid $ 750 million to redeem all $ 750 million outstanding principal amount of our 1.70 % senior notes due 2021 and terminated the associated interest rate swap with a notional amount of $ 250 million. In 2020, we paid $ 1.1 billion to redeem all $ 1.1 billion outstanding principal amount of our 2.15 % senior notes due 2020 and terminated associated interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $ 0.8 billion. Also in 2020, one of our international consolidated subsidiaries borrowed 21.7 billion South African rand, or approximately $ 1.3 billion, from our two unsecured bridge loan facilities (Bridge Loan Facilities) to fund our acquisition of Pioneer Foods. These borrowings were fully repaid in April 2020 and no further borrowings under these Bridge Loan Facilities are permitted. Note 9 — Financial Instruments Derivatives and Hedging We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in: • commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy; • foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and • interest rates. In the normal course of business, we manage commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of strategies, including productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs and hedging. Ongoing productivity initiatives involve the identification and effective implementation of meaningful cost-saving opportunities or efficiencies, including the use of derivatives. We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Our global purchasing programs include fixed-price contracts and purchase orders and pricing agreements. Our hedging strategies include the use of derivatives and, in the case of our net investment hedges, debt instruments. Certain derivatives are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment, while others do not qualify and are marked to market through earnings. The accounting for qualifying hedges allows changes in a hedging instrument’s fair value to offset corresponding changes in the hedged item in the same reporting period that the hedged item impacts earnings. Gains or losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders’ equity and reclassified to our income statement when the hedged transaction affects earnings. If it becomes probable that the hedged transaction will not occur, 97 Table of Contents we immediately recognize the related hedging gains or losses in earnings; such gains or losses reclassified during the year ended December 31, 2022 were not material. Cash flows from derivatives used to manage commodity price, foreign exchange or interest rate risks are classified as operating activities in the cash flow statement. We classify both the earnings and cash flow impact from these derivatives consistent with the underlying hedged item. Credit Risk We perform assessments of our counterparty credit risk regularly, including reviewing netting agreements, if any, and a review of credit ratings, credit default swap rates and potential nonperformance of the counterparty. Based on our most recent assessment of our counterparty credit risk, we consider this risk to be low. In addition, we enter into derivative contracts with a variety of financial institutions that we believe are creditworthy in order to reduce our concentration of credit risk. Certain of our agreements with our counterparties require us to post full collateral on derivative instruments in a net liability position if our credit rating is at A2 (Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.) or A (S&P Global Ratings) and we have been placed on credit watch for possible downgrade or if our credit rating falls below either of these levels. The fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position as of December 31, 2022 was $ 235 million. We have posted no collateral under these contracts and no credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered as of December 31, 2022. Commodity Prices We are subject to commodity price risk because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited in the competitive environment in which we operate. This risk is managed through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, which primarily include swaps and futures. In addition, risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. We use derivatives, with terms of no more than three years , to hedge price fluctuations related to a portion of our anticipated commodity purchases, primarily for agricultural products, energy and metals. Derivatives used to hedge commodity price risk that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Our commodity derivatives had a total notional value of $ 1.8 billion as of December 31, 2022 and $ 1.6 billion as of December 25, 2021. Foreign Exchange We are exposed to foreign exchange risks in the international markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. Additionally, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency purchases and foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. We manage this risk through sourcing purchases from local suppliers, negotiating contracts in local currencies with foreign suppliers and through the use of derivatives, primarily forward contracts with terms of no more than two years . Exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions are recognized as transaction gains or losses on our income statement as incurred. We also use net investment hedges to partially offset the effects of foreign currency on our investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries. Our foreign currency derivatives had a total notional value of $ 3.0 billion as of December 31, 2022 and $ 2.8 billion as of December 25, 2021. The total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net 98 Table of Contents investment hedges was $ 2.9 billion as of December 31, 2022 and $ 2.1 billion as of December 25, 2021. For foreign currency derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, gains and losses were offset by changes in the underlying hedged items, resulting in no material net impact on earnings. Interest Rates We centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks, tax consequences and overall financing strategies. We use various interest rate derivative instruments including, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps, Treasury locks and swap locks to manage our overall interest expense and foreign exchange risk. These instruments effectively change the interest rate and currency of specific debt issuances. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt. Our cross-currency interest rate swaps have terms of no more than twelve years . Our Treasury locks and swap locks are entered into to protect against unfavorable interest rate changes relating to forecasted debt transactions. Our interest rate derivatives had a total notional value of $ 1.3 billion as of December 31, 2022 and $ 2.1 billion as of December 25, 2021. As of December 31, 2022, approximately 1 % of total debt was subject to variable rates, compared to approximately 2 %, after the impact of the related interest rate derivative instruments, as of December 25, 2021. Debt Securities Held-to-Maturity Investments in debt securities that we have the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity. Highly liquid debt securities with original maturities of three months or less are recorded as cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2022, we had no investments in held-to-maturity debt securities. As of December 25, 2021, we had $ 130 million of investments in commercial paper recorded in cash and cash equivalents. Held-to-maturity debt securities are recorded at amortized cost, which approximates fair value, and realized gains or losses are reported in earnings. As of December 25, 2021, gross unrecognized gains and losses and the allowance for expected credit losses were not material. Available-for-Sale Investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale debt securities are generally recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders’ equity. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale debt securities impact earnings only when such securities are sold, or an allowance for expected credit losses or impairment is recognized. We regularly evaluate our investment portfolio for expected credit losses and impairment. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the extent to which the fair value of a debt security is less than its amortized cost; the financial condition of the issuer, including the credit quality, and any changes thereto; and our intent to sell, or whether we will more likely than not be required to sell, the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Our assessment of whether a debt security has a credit loss or is impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular debt security. In 2022, we entered into an agreement with Celsius to distribute Celsius energy drinks in the United States (see Note 4 for further information) and invested $ 550 million in Series A convertible preferred shares issued by Celsius, which included certain conversion and redemption features. The preferred shares automatically convert into Celsius common shares after six years if certain market-based conditions are met, or can be redeemed after seven years. Shares underlying the transaction were priced at $ 75 per share, 99 Table of Contents and the preferred shares are entitled to a 5 % annual dividend, payable either in cash or in-kind. Given our redemption right, we classified our investment in the convertible preferred stock as an available-for-sale debt security. There were no unrealized gains and losses on our investment as of December 31, 2022. There were no impairment charges related to our investment in the year ended December 31, 2022. Fair Value Measurements The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021 are categorized as follows: 2022 2021 Fair Value Hierarchy Levels (a) Assets (a) Liabilities (a) Assets (a) Liabilities (a) Available-for-sale debt securities (b) 2 $ 660 $ — $ — $ — Index funds (c) 1 $ 257 $ — $ 337 $ — Prepaid forward contracts (d) 2 $ 14 $ — $ 21 $ — Deferred compensation (e) 2 $ — $ 434 $ — $ 505 Derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments: Foreign exchange (f) 2 $ 24 $ 22 $ 29 $ 14 Interest rate (f) 2 — 164 14 264 Commodity (g) 2 2 60 70 5 $ 26 $ 246 $ 113 $ 283 Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Foreign exchange (f) 2 $ 21 $ 21 $ 19 $ 7 Commodity (g) 2 11 51 35 22 $ 32 $ 72 $ 54 $ 29 Total derivatives at fair value (h) $ 58 $ 318 $ 167 $ 312 Total $ 989 $ 752 $ 525 $ 817 (a) Fair value hierarchy levels are defined in Note 7. Unless otherwise noted, financial assets are classified on our balance sheet within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets. Financial liabilities are classified on our balance sheet within accounts payable and other current liabilities and other liabilities.

We have operating leases for plants, warehouses, distribution centers, storage facilities, offices and other facilities, as well as machinery and equipment, including fleet. Our leases generally have remaining lease terms of up to 20 years, some of which include options to extend the lease term for up to five years and some of which include options to terminate the lease within one year . We consider these options in determining the lease term used to establish our right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. We have lease agreements that contain both lease and non-lease components. For real estate leases, we account for lease components together with non-lease components (e.g., common-area maintenance). 103 Table of Contents Components of lease cost are as follows: 2022 2021 2020 Operating lease cost (a) $ 585 $ 563 $ 539 Variable lease cost (b) $ 115 $ 112 $ 111 Short-term lease cost (c) $ 510 $ 469 $ 436 (a) Includes right-of-use asset amortization of $ 517 million, $ 505 million, and $ 478 million in 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively. (b) Primarily related to adjustments for inflation, common-area maintenance and property tax. (c) Not recorded on our balance sheet. In 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recognized gains of $ 175 million, $ 42 million and $ 7 million, respectively, on sale-leaseback transactions with terms under five years. Supplemental cash flow information and non-cash activity related to our operating leases are as follows: 2022 2021 2020 Operating cash flow information: Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities $ 573 $ 567 $ 555 Non-cash activity: Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations $ 871 $ 934 $ 621 Supplemental balance sheet information related to our operating leases is as follows: Balance Sheet Classification 2022 2021 Right-of-use assets Other assets $ 2,373 $ 2,020 Current lease liabilities Accounts payable and other current liabilities $ 483 $ 446 Non-current lease liabilities Other liabilities $ 1,933 $ 1,598 Weighted-average remaining lease term and discount rate for our operating leases are as follows: 2022 2021 2020 Weighted-average remaining lease term 7 years 7 years 6 years Weighted-average discount rate 3 % 3 % 4 % Maturities of lease liabilities by year for our operating leases are as follows: 2023 $ 541 2024 465 2025 386 2026 326 2027 266 2028 and beyond 718 Total lease payments 2,702 Less: Imputed interest 286 Present value of lease liabilities $ 2,416 Lessor We have various arrangements for certain foodservice and vending equipment under which we are the lessor. These leases meet the criteria for operating lease classification. Lease income associated with these leases is not material. 104 Table of Contents Note 13 — Acquisitions and Divestitures Juice Transaction In the first quarter of 2022, we sold our Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands to PAI Partners for approximately $ 3.5 billion in cash, subject to purchase price adjustments, and a 39% noncontrolling interest in TBG, operating across North America and Europe. The North America portion of the transaction was completed on January 24, 2022 and the Europe portion of the transaction was completed on February 1, 2022. In the United States, PepsiCo acts as the exclusive distributor for TBG’s portfolio of brands for small-format and foodservice customers with chilled DSD. We have significant influence over our investment in TBG and account for our investment under the equity method, recognizing our proportionate share of TBG’s earnings on our income statement (recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses). As a result of this transaction, in the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded a gain in our PBNA and Europe divisions (see detailed income statement activity below), including $ 520 million related to the remeasurement of our 39 % ownership in TBG at fair value using a combination of the transaction price, discounted cash flo ws and an option pricing model related to our liquidation preference in TBG . In the fourth quarter of 2022, we reached an agreement on final purchase price adjustments for net working capital and net debt amounts as of the transaction close date compared to targeted amounts set forth in the purchase agreement. A summary of income statement activity related to the Juice Transaction for the year ended December 31, 2022 is as follows: PBNA Europe Corporate Total PepsiCo Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to PepsiCo Impact on net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share Gain associated with the Juice Transaction $ ( 3,029 ) $ ( 292 ) $ — $ ( 3,321 ) $ 433 $ ( 2,888 ) $ 2.08 Acquisition and divestiture-related charges 51 14 6 71 ( 13 ) 58 ( 0.04 ) Operating profit $ ( 2,978 ) $ ( 278 ) $ 6 ( 3,250 ) 420 ( 2,830 ) 2.04 Other pension and retiree medical benefits income (b) ( 10 ) 3 ( 7 ) 0.01 Total Juice Transaction $ ( 3,260 ) $ 423 $ ( 2,837 ) $ 2.04 (c) (a) Includes $ 186 million of deferred tax expense related to the recognition of our investment in TBG. (b) Includes $ 16 million curtailment gain, partially offset by $ 6 million special termination benefits. (c) Does not sum due to rounding. In connection with the sale, we entered into a transition services agreement with PAI Partners, under which we provide certain services to TBG to help facilitate an orderly transition of the business following the sale. In return for these services, TBG is required to pay certain agreed upon fees to reimburse us for our costs without markup. As of December 25, 2021, $ 1.8 billion of assets, primarily accounts receivable, net, and inventories of $ 0.5 billion, goodwill and other intangible assets of $ 0.6 billion and property, plant and equipment of $ 0.5 billion, and liabilities of $ 0.8 billion, primarily accounts payable and other liabilities of $ 0.6 billion and deferred income taxes of $ 0.2 billion, related to the Juice Transaction were reclassified as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet. The Juice Transaction did not meet the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations. As of December 31, 2022, there were no amounts classified as held for sale. 105 Table of Contents 2020 Acquisitions On March 23, 2020, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Pioneer Foods, a food and beverage company in South Africa with exports to countries across the globe, for 110.00 South African rand per share in cash. The total consideration transferred was approximately $ 1.2 billion and was funded by two unsecured bridge loan facilities entered into by one of our international consolidated subsidiaries, which were fully repaid in April 2020. In connection with our acquisition of Pioneer Foods, we have made certain commitments to the South Africa Competition Commission, including a commitment to provide the equivalent of 8.8 billion South African rand, or approximately $ 0.5 billion as of the acquisition date, in value for the benefit of our employees, agricultural development, education, developing Pioneer Foods’ operations and enterprise development programs in South Africa. Included in this commitment is 2.3 billion South African rand, or approximately $ 0.1 billion, relating to the implementation of an employee ownership plan and an agricultural, entrepreneurship and educational development fund, which is an irrevocable condition of the acquisition. This commitment was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily in the year ended December 26, 2020 and was primarily settled in the fourth quarter of 2021. The remaining commitment of 6.5 billion South African rand, or approximately $ 0.4 billion as of the acquisition date, relates to capital expenditures and/or business-related costs which will be incurred and recorded over a five-year period from the acquisition date. On April 24, 2020, we acquired Rockstar, an energy drink maker with whom we had a distribution agreement prior to the acquisition, for an upfront cash payment of approximately $ 3.85 billion and contingent consideration related to estimated future tax benefits associated with the acquisition of approximately $ 0.88 billion. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we exercised our option to accelerate all remaining payments due under the contingent consideration arrangement. On June 1, 2020, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Be & Cheery, one of the largest online convenient food companies in China, from Haoxiangni Health Food Co., Ltd. for cash. The total consideration transferred was approximately $ 0.7 billion. We accounted for the 2020 transactions as business combinations. We recognized and measured the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the respective dates of acquisition. The purchase price allocations for each of the 2020 acquisitions were finalized in the second quarter of 2021. The fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisitions of Pioneer Foods, Rockstar and Be & Cheery and the resulting goodwill as of the respective acquisition dates is summarized as follows: Pioneer Foods Rockstar Be & Cheery Acquisition date March 23, 2020 April 24, 2020 June 1, 2020 Inventories $ 229 $ 52 $ 45 Property, plant and equipment 379 8 60 Amortizable intangible assets 52 — 98 Nonamortizable intangible assets 183 2,400 309 Other assets and liabilities ( 53 ) ( 9 ) ( 24 ) Net deferred income taxes ( 117 ) — ( 99 ) Noncontrolling interest ( 5 ) — — Total identifiable net assets 668 2,451 389 Goodwill 558 2,278 309 Total purchase price $ 1,226 $ 4,729 $ 698 106 Table of Contents Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets recognized.

Acquisition and Divestiture-Related Charges Acquisition and divestiture-related charges primarily include fair value adjustments to the acquired inventory included in the acquisition-date balance sheets (recorded in cost of sales), merger and integration charges and costs associated with divestitures (recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses). Merger and integration charges include liabilities to support socioeconomic programs in South Africa, gains associated with contingent consideration, employee-related costs, contract termination costs, closing costs and other integration costs. Divestiture-related charges reflect transaction expenses, including consulting, advisory and other professional fees. A summary of our acquisition and divestiture-related charges is as follows: 2022 2021 2020 Cost of sales $ — $ 1 $ 32 Selling, general and administrative expenses (a) 74 ( 5 ) 223 Other pension and retiree medical benefits expense 6 — — Total $ 80 $ ( 4 ) $ 255 After-tax amount (b) $ 66 $ ( 27 ) $ 237 Impact on net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share $ ( 0.05 ) $ 0.02 $ ( 0.17 ) (a) The income amount primarily relates to the acceleration payment made in the fourth quarter of 2021 under the contingent consideration arrangement associated with our acquisition of Rockstar, which is partially offset by other acquisition and divestiture-related charges.

We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2022 and December 25, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2022 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Basis for Opinions The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 110 Table of Contents Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Sales incentive accruals As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company offers sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. A number of the sales incentives are based on annual targets, resulting in the need to accrue for the expected liability. These incentives are accrued for in the “Accounts payable and other current liabilities” line on the balance sheet. These accruals are based on sales incentive agreements, expectations regarding customer and consumer participation and performance levels, and historical experience and trends. We identified the evaluation of certain of the Company’s sales incentive accruals as a critical audit matter. Subjective and complex auditor judgment is required in evaluating these sales incentive accruals as a result of the timing difference between when the product is delivered and when the incentive is settled. This specifically related to (1) forecasted customer and consumer participation and performance level assumptions underlying the accrual, and (2) the impact of historical experience and trends. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the sales incentive process, including controls related to (1) the accrual methodology, (2) assumptions around forecasted customer and consumer participation, (3) performance levels, and (4) monitoring of actual sales incentives incurred compared to estimated sales incentives in respect of historical periods. To evaluate the timing and amount of certain accrued sales incentives we (1) analyzed the accrual by sales incentive type as compared to historical trends to identify specific sales incentives that may require additional testing, (2) recalculated expenses and closing accruals on a sample basis, 111 Table of Contents based on volumes sold and terms of the sales incentives, (3) assessed the Company’s ability to accurately estimate its sales incentive accrual by comparing previously established accruals to actual settlements, and (4) tested a sample of settlements or claims that occurred after period end, and compared them to the recorded sales incentive accrual. Carrying value of certain reacquired and acquired franchise rights and SodaStream brand As discussed in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company performs impairment testing of its indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis during the third quarter of each fiscal year and whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that there is a greater than 50% likelihood that the asset is impaired. The carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2022 was $32.5 billion which represents 35% of total assets, and includes PepsiCo Beverages North America’s (PBNA) reacquired and acquired franchise rights which had a carrying value of $8.8 billion as of December 31, 2022. We identified the assessment of the carrying value of PBNA’s reacquired and acquired franchise rights and the SodaStream brand in Europe as a critical audit matter. Significant auditor judgment is necessary to assess the impact of competitive operating and macroeconomic factors on future levels of sales, operating profit and cash flows. The impairment analysis of these indefinite-lived intangible assets requires significant auditor judgment to evaluate the Company’s forecasted revenue and profitability levels, including the expected long-term growth rates and the selection of the discount rates to be applied to the projected cash flows. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the indefinite-lived assets impairment process, including controls related to the development of forecasted revenue, profitability levels, and expected long-term growth rates and select the discount rates to be applied to the projected cash flows. We also evaluated the sensitivity of the Company’s conclusion to changes in assumptions, including the assessment of changes in assumptions from prior periods. To assess the Company’s ability to accurately forecast, we compared the Company’s historical forecasted results to actual results. We compared the cash flow projections used in the impairment tests with available external industry data and other internal information. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in evaluating (1) the long-term growth rates used in the impairment tests by comparing against economic data and information specific to the respective assets, including projected long-term nominal Gross Domestic Product growth in the respective local countries, and (2) the discount rates used in the impairment tests by comparing them against discount rates that were independently developed using publicly available market data, including that of comparable companies. Unrecognized tax benefits As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s global operating model gives rise to income tax obligations in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions in which it operates. As of December 31, 2022, the Company recorded reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $1.9 billion. The Company establishes reserves if it believes that certain positions taken in its tax returns are subject to challenge and the Company likely will not succeed, even though the Company believes the tax return position is supportable under the tax law. The Company adjusts these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of new information, such as the progress of a tax examination, new tax law, relevant court rulings or tax authority settlements. We identified the evaluation of certain of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits as a critical audit matter because the application of tax law and interpretation of a tax authority’s settlement history is complex and involves subjective judgment. Such judgments impact both the timing and amount of 112 Table of Contents the reserves that are recognized, including judgments about re-measuring liabilities for positions taken in prior years’ tax returns in light of new information. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the unrecognized tax benefits process, including controls to (1) identify uncertain income tax positions, (2) evaluate the tax law and tax authority’s settlement history used to estimate the unrecognized tax benefits, and (3) monitor for new information that may give rise to changes to the existing unrecognized tax benefits, such as progress of a tax examination, new tax law or tax authority settlements. We involved tax and valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in assessing the unrecognized tax benefits by (1) evaluating the Company’s tax structure and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, and (2) assessing the Company’s interpretation of existing tax law as well as new and amended tax laws, tax positions taken, associated external counsel opinions, information from tax examinations, relevant court rulings and tax authority settlements. /s/ KPMG LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1990.

These systems implementations are part of our ongoing global business transformation initiative, and we plan to continue implementing such systems throughout other parts of our businesses in phases over the next several years. In connection with these ERP implementations, we are updating and will continue to update our internal control over financial reporting, as necessary, to accommodate modifications to our business processes and accounting procedures. During 2022, we continued implementing these systems, resulting in changes that materially affected our internal control over financial reporting. These system implementations did not have an adverse effect, nor do we expect will have an adverse effect, on our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, in connection with our 2019 multi-year productivity plan, we continue to migrate to shared business models across our operations to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes. In connection with our 2019 multi-year 116 Table of Contents productivity plan and resulting business process changes, we continue to enhance the design and documentation of our internal control over financial reporting processes, to maintain effective controls over our financial reporting. These business process changes have not materially affected, and we do not expect them to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Except with respect to the continued implementation of ERP systems, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our fourth quarter of 2022 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We will continue to assess the impact on our internal control over financial reporting as we continue to implement our ERP solution and our 2019 multi-year productivity plan. Item 9B.

All statements addressing our future operating performance, and statements addressing events and developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act. These forward-looking statements are based on currently available information, operating plans and projections about future events and trends. They inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in any such forward-looking statement.

We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The discussion of risks in this report is by no means all-inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our future performance. PART I Item 1. Business. When used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “PepsiCo” and the “Company” mean PepsiCo, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, collectively. Certain terms used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are defined in the Glossary included in Item 7. of this report. Company Overview We were incorporated in Delaware in 1919 and reincorporated in North Carolina in 1986. We are a leading global beverage and convenient food company with a complementary portfolio of brands, including Lays, Doritos, Cheetos, Gatorade, Pepsi-Cola, Mountain Dew, Quaker and SodaStream. Through our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a wide variety of beverages and convenient foods, serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories. Our Operations We are organized into seven reportable segments (also referred to as divisions), as follows: 1) Frito-Lay North America (FLNA), which includes our branded convenient food businesses in the United States and Canada; 2) Quaker Foods North America (QFNA), which includes our branded convenient food businesses, such as cereal, rice, pasta and other branded food, in the United States and Canada; 3) PepsiCo Beverages North America (PBNA), which includes our beverage businesses in the United States and Canada; 4) Latin America (LatAm), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Latin America; 5) Europe, which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Europe; 2 Table of Contents 6) Africa, Middle East and South Asia (AMESA), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia; and 7) Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China Region (APAC), which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand, and China region.

Our Distribution Network Our products are primarily brought to market through direct-store-delivery (DSD), customer warehouse and distributor networks and are also sold directly to consumers through e-commerce platforms and retailers. The distribution system used depends on customer needs, product characteristics and local trade practices. 4 Table of Contents Direct-Store-Delivery We, our independent bottlers and our distributors operate DSD systems that deliver beverages and convenient foods directly to retail stores where the products are merchandised by our employees or our independent bottlers. DSD enables us to merchandise with maximum visibility and appeal. DSD is especially well-suited to products that are restocked often and respond to in-store promotion and merchandising. Customer Warehouse Some of our products are delivered from our manufacturing plants and distribution centers, both company and third-party operated, to customer warehouses. These less costly systems generally work best for products that are less fragile and perishable, and have lower turnover. Distributor Networks We distribute many of our products through third-party distributors. Third-party distributors are particularly effective when greater distribution reach can be achieved by including a wide range of products on the delivery vehicles. For example, our foodservice and vending business distributes beverages and convenient foods to restaurants, businesses, schools and stadiums through third-party foodservice and vending distributors and operators. E-commerce Our products are also available and sold directly to consumers on a growing number of company-owned and third-party e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications. Ingredients and Other Supplies The principal ingredients we use in our beverage and convenient food products are apple, orange and pineapple juice and other juice concentrates, aspartame, corn, corn sweeteners, flavorings, flour, grapefruit, oranges and other fruits, oats, potatoes, raw milk, rice, seasonings, sucralose, sugar, vegetable and essential oils, and wheat. We also use water in the manufacturing of our products. Our key packaging materials include plastic resins, including polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene resins used for plastic beverage bottles and film packaging used for convenient foods, aluminum, glass, closures, cardboard and paperboard cartons. In addition, we continue to integrate recyclability into our product development process and support the increased use of recycled content, including recycled PET, in our packaging. Fuel, electricity and natural gas are also important commodities for our businesses due to their use in our and our business partners’ facilities and the vehicles delivering our products. We employ specialists to secure adequate supplies of many of these items and have not experienced any significant continuous shortages that would prevent us from meeting our requirements. Many of these ingredients, raw materials and commodities are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and futures. In addition, risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. When prices increase, we may or may not pass on such increases to our customers. In addition, we continue to make investments to improve the sustainability and resources of our agricultural supply chain, including the development of our initiative to advance sustainable farming practices by our suppliers and expanding it further globally. During 2021, we experienced higher than anticipated commodity, packaging and other input costs and, in some instances, limited shortages due to global inflation, supply chain disruptions, labor shortages, increased demand and other regulatory and macroeconomic factors associated with the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, which has continued into fiscal 2022. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on how we manage our exposure to commodity prices. 5 Table of Contents We also maintain voluntary supply chain finance agreements with several participating global financial institutions, pursuant to which our suppliers, at their sole discretion, may elect to sell their accounts receivable with PepsiCo to such global financial institutions. These agreements did not have a material impact on our business or financial results. See “Our Financial Results – Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for further information. Our Brands and Intellectual Property Rights We own numerous valuable trademarks which are essential to our worldwide businesses, including Agusha, Amp Energy, Aquafina, Aquafina Flavorsplash, Arto Lifewtr, BaiCaoWei, Bare, Bokomo, Bolt24, bubly, Cap’n Crunch, Ceres, Cheetos, Chester’s, Chipita, Chipsy, Chokis, Chudo, Cracker Jack, Crunchy, Diet Mountain Dew, Diet Mug, Diet Pepsi, Diet 7UP (outside the United States), Domik v Derevne, Doritos, Driftwell, Duyvis, Elma Chips, Emperador, Evolve, Frito-Lay, Fritos, Fruktovy Sad, G2, Gamesa, Gatorade, Gatorade Zero, Gatorlyte, Grandma’s, H2oh!, Health Warrior, Imunele, J7, Kas, Kurkure, Lay’s, Life, Lifewtr, Liquifruit, Lubimy, Mabel, Manzanita Sol, Marias Gamesa, Matutano, Mirinda, Miss Vickie’s, Moirs, Mother’s, Mountain Dew, Mountain Dew Code Red, Mountain Dew Game Fuel, Mountain Dew Kickstart, Mountain Dew Zero Sugar, MTN Dew Energy, Mug, Munchies, Muscle Milk, Near East, Off the Eaten Path, Paso de los Toros, Pasta Roni, Pearl Milling Company, Pepsi, Pepsi Black, Pepsi Max, Pepsi Zero Sugar, PopCorners, Pronutro, Propel, Quaker, Quaker Chewy, Quaker Simply Granola, Rice-A-Roni, Rockstar Energy, Rold Gold, Ruffles, Sabritas, Safari, Sakata, Saladitas, San Carlos, Sandora, Santitas, Sasko, 7UP (outside the United States), 7UP Free (outside the United States), Sierra Mist, Sierra Mist Zero Sugar, Simba, Smartfood, Smith’s, Snack a Jacks, SoBe, SodaStream, Sonric’s, Spekko, Stacy’s, Sting, Stubborn Soda, SunChips, Toddy, Toddynho, Tostitos, V Water, Vesely Molochnik, Walkers, Weetbix, White Star, Ya and Yachak. We also hold long-term licenses to use valuable trademarks in connection with our products in certain markets, including Ocean Spray. We also distribute Bang Energy drinks and various Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. brands, including Dr Pepper in certain markets, Crush and Schweppes. Joint ventures in which we have an ownership interest either own or have the right to use certain trademarks, such as Lipton, Sabra and Starbucks. In addition, in the first quarter of 2022, we sold our Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands to PAI Partners while retaining a 39% noncontrolling interest in a newly formed joint venture that will operate across North America and Europe. In the U.S., PepsiCo acts as the exclusive distributor for the new joint venture’s portfolio of brands for small-format and foodservice customers with chilled direct-store-delivery. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. In 2022, we will also begin to distribute Hard MTN Dew, an alcoholic beverage manufactured and owned by the Boston Beer Company. We have licensed the use of the Hard MTN Dew trademark to the Boston Beer Company, which has appointed us as their distributor for this product. Trademarks remain valid so long as they are used properly for identification purposes, and we emphasize correct use of our trademarks. We have authorized, through licensing arrangements, the use of many of our trademarks in such contexts as convenient food joint ventures and beverage bottling appointments. In addition, we license the use of our trademarks on merchandise that is sold at retail, which enhances brand awareness. We either own or have licenses to use a number of patents which relate to certain of our products, their packaging, the processes for their production and the design and operation of various equipment used in our businesses. Some of these patents are licensed to others. Seasonality Our businesses are affected by seasonal variations. Our beverage and convenient food sales are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related patterns and generally lowest in the first quarter. However, taken as a whole, seasonality has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial results. 6 Table of Contents Our Customers Our customers include wholesale and other distributors, foodservice customers, grocery stores, drug stores, convenience stores, discount/dollar stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, hard discounters, e-commerce retailers and authorized independent bottlers, among others. We normally grant our independent bottlers exclusive contracts to sell and manufacture certain beverage products bearing our trademarks within a specific geographic area. These arrangements provide us with the right to charge our independent bottlers for concentrate, finished goods and Aquafina royalties and specify the manufacturing process required for product quality. We also grant distribution rights to our independent bottlers for certain beverage products bearing our trademarks for specified geographic areas. We rely on and provide financial incentives to our customers to assist in the distribution and promotion of our products to the consumer. For our independent distributors and retailers, these incentives include volume-based rebates, product placement fees, promotions and displays. For our independent bottlers, these incentives are referred to as bottler funding and are negotiated annually with each bottler to support a variety of trade and consumer programs, such as consumer incentives, advertising support, new product support, and vending and cooler equipment placement. Consumer incentives include pricing discounts and promotions, and other promotional offers. Advertising support is directed at advertising programs and supporting independent bottler media. New product support includes targeted consumer and retailer incentives and direct marketplace support, such as point-of-purchase materials, product placement fees, media and advertising. Vending and cooler equipment placement programs support the acquisition and placement of vending machines and cooler equipment. The nature and type of programs vary annually. Changes to the retail landscape, including increased consolidation of retail ownership, the continued growth of sales through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription services and other direct-to-consumer businesses, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers, as well as the international expansion of hard discounters, and the current economic environment, including in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, continue to increase the importance of major customers. In 2021, sales to Walmart Inc. (Walmart) and its affiliates, including Sam’s Club (Sam’s), represented approximately 13% of our consolidated net revenue, with sales reported across all of our divisions, including concentrate sales to our independent bottlers, which were used in finished goods sold by them to Walmart. The loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on our FLNA, QFNA and PBNA divisions. Our Competition Our beverage and convenient food products are in highly competitive categories and markets and compete against products of international beverage and convenient food companies that, like us, operate in multiple geographies, as well as regional, local and private label manufacturers and economy brands and other competitors, including smaller companies developing and selling micro brands directly to consumers through e-commerce platforms or through retailers focused on locally-sourced products. In many countries in which our products are sold, including the United States, The Coca-Cola Company is our primary beverage competitor. Other beverage and convenient food competitors include, but are not limited to, Campbell Soup Company, Conagra Brands, Inc., Hormel Foods Corporation, Kellogg Company, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., The Kraft Heinz Company, Link Snacks, Inc., Mondelēz International, Inc., Monster Beverage Corporation, Nestlé S.A., Red Bull GmbH and Utz Brands, Inc. Many of our convenient food products hold significant leadership positions in the convenient food industry in the United States and worldwide. In 2021, we and The Coca-Cola Company represented approximately 22% and 19%, respectively, of the U.S. liquid refreshment beverage category by estimated retail sales in measured channels, according to Information Resources, Inc. However, The Coca-Cola 7 Table of Contents Company has significant carbonated soft drink (CSD) share advantage in many markets outside the United States. Our beverage and convenient food products compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition and loyalty, taste, price, value, quality, product variety, innovation, distribution, advertising, marketing and promotional activity (including digital), packaging, convenience, service and the ability to anticipate and effectively respond to consumer preferences and trends, including increased consumer focus on health and wellness and sustainability and the continued acceleration of e-commerce and other methods of distributing and purchasing products. Success in this competitive environment is dependent on effective promotion of existing products, effective introduction of new products and reformulations of existing products, increased efficiency in production techniques, effective incorporation of technology and digital tools across all areas of our business, the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns, marketing programs, product packaging and pricing, new vending and dispensing equipment and brand and trademark development and protection. We believe that the strength of our brands, innovation and marketing, coupled with the quality of our products and flexibility of our distribution network, allows us to compete effectively. Research and Development We engage in a variety of research and development activities and invest in innovation globally with the goal of meeting the needs of our customers and consumers and accelerating growth. These activities principally involve: innovations focused on creating consumer preferred products to grow and transform our portfolio through development of new technologies, ingredients, flavors and substrates; development and improvement of our manufacturing processes including reductions in cost and environmental footprint; implementing product improvements to our global portfolio that reduce added sugars, sodium or saturated fat; offering more products with functional ingredients and positive nutrition including whole grains, fruit, vegetables, dairy, protein, fiber, micronutrients and hydration; development of packaging technology and new package designs, including reducing the amount of plastic in our packaging and developing recyclable, compostable, biodegradable or otherwise sustainable packaging; development of marketing, merchandising and dispensing equipment; further expanding our beyond the bottle portfolio including innovation for our SodaStream business; investments in technology and digitalization, including artificial intelligence and data analytics to enhance our consumer insights and research; continuing to strengthen our omnichannel capabilities, particularly in e-commerce; and efforts focused on reducing our impact on the environment, including reducing water use in our operations and our agricultural practices and reducing our climate impact in our operations throughout our value chain. Our research centers are located around the world, including in Brazil, China, India, Ireland, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States, and leverage consumer insights, food science and engineering to meet our strategy to continually innovate our portfolio of beverages and convenient foods. Regulatory Matters The conduct of our businesses, including the production, storage, distribution, sale, display, advertising, marketing, labeling, content, quality, safety, transportation, packaging, disposal, recycling and use of our products, as well as our employment and occupational health and safety practices and protection of personal information, are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States, as well as to laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies in the more than 200 other countries and territories in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. It is our policy to abide by the laws and regulations around the world that apply to our businesses. 8 Table of Contents The U.S. laws and regulations that we are subject to include, but are not limited to: the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and various state laws governing food safety; the Food Safety Modernization Act; the Occupational Safety and Health Act and various state laws and regulations governing workplace health and safety; various federal, state and local environmental protection laws, as discussed below; the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act; the Federal Trade Commission Act; the Lanham Act; various federal and state laws and regulations governing competition and trade practices; various federal and state laws and regulations governing our employment practices, including those related to equal employment opportunity, such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Act and the National Labor Relations Act and those related to overtime compensation, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act; various state and federal laws pertaining to sale and distribution of alcohol beverages; data privacy and personal data protection laws and regulations, including the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (as modified by the California Privacy Rights Act); customs and foreign trade laws and regulations, including laws regarding the import or export of our products or ingredients used in our products and tariffs; laws regulating the sale of certain of our products in schools; laws regulating our supply chain, including the 2010 California Transparency in Supply Chains Act and laws relating to the payment of taxes. We are also required to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act. We are also subject to various state and local statutes and regulations, including state consumer protection laws such as Proposition 65 in California, which requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a substance listed by the State of California as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects, unless the amount of such substance in the product is below a safe harbor level. We are subject to numerous similar and other laws and regulations outside the United States, including but not limited to laws and regulations governing food safety, international trade and tariffs, supply chain, including the U.K. Modern Slavery Act, occupational health and safety, competition, anti-corruption and data privacy, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. In many jurisdictions, compliance with competition laws is of special importance to us due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions, as is compliance with anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act. We rely on legal and operational compliance programs, as well as in-house and outside counsel and other experts, to guide our businesses in complying with the laws and regulations around the world that apply to our businesses. In addition, certain jurisdictions have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or commodities used in the production of our products. These taxes vary in scope and form: some apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). Similarly, some measures apply a single tax rate per ounce/liter on beverages containing over a certain level of added sugar (or other sweetener) while others apply a graduated tax rate depending upon the amount of added sugar (or other sweetener) in the beverage and some apply a flat tax rate on beverages containing a particular substance or ingredient, regardless of the level of such substance or ingredient. In addition, certain jurisdictions have either imposed, or are considering imposing, product labeling or warning requirements or other limitations on the marketing or sale of certain of our products as a result of ingredients or substances contained in such products or the audience to whom products are marketed. These types of provisions have required that we highlight perceived concerns about a product, warn consumers to avoid consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in our products, restrict the age of consumers to whom products are marketed or sold or limit the location in which our products may be available. It is possible that similar or more restrictive requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future. In addition, certain jurisdictions have either imposed or are considering imposing regulations designed to increase recycling rates or encourage waste reduction. These regulations vary in scope and form from 9 Table of Contents deposit return systems designed to incentivize the return of beverage containers, to extended producer responsibility policies and even bans on the use of some types of single-use plastics. It is possible that similar or more restrictive requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future. We are also subject to national and local environmental laws in the United States and in foreign countries in which we do business, including laws related to water consumption and treatment, wastewater discharge and air emissions. In the United States, our facilities must comply with the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other federal and state laws regarding handling, storage, release and disposal of wastes generated onsite and sent to third-party owned and operated offsite licensed facilities and our facilities outside the United States must comply with similar laws and regulations. In addition, continuing concern over environmental, social and governance matters, including climate change, is expected to continue to result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements (in or outside of the United States) to reduce or mitigate the potential effects of greenhouse gases, to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity concerns or to expand mandatory reporting of certain environmental, social and governance metrics. Our policy is to abide by all applicable environmental laws and regulations, and we have internal programs in place with respect to our global environmental compliance. We have made, and plan to continue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and to achieve our sustainability goals. While these expenditures have not had a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations to date, changes in environmental compliance requirements, and expenditures necessary to comply with such requirements or to achieve our sustainability goals, could adversely affect our financial performance. In addition, we and our subsidiaries are subject to environmental remediation obligations arising in the normal course of business, as well as remediation and related indemnification obligations in connection with certain historical activities and contractual obligations, including those of businesses acquired by us or our subsidiaries. While these environmental remediation and indemnification obligations cannot be predicted with certainty, such obligations have not had, and are not expected to have, a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. In addition to the discussion in this section, see also “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Human Capital PepsiCo believes that human capital management, including attracting, developing and retaining a high quality workforce, is critical to our long-term success. Our Board of Directors (Board) and its Committees provide oversight on a broad range of human capital management topics, including corporate culture, diversity, equity and inclusion, pay equity, health and safety, training and development and compensation and benefits. We employed approximately 309,000 people worldwide as of December 25, 2021, including approximately 129,000 people within the United States. We are party to numerous collective bargaining agreements and believe that relations with our employees are generally good. Protecting the safety, health, and well-being of our associates around the world is PepsiCo’s top priority. We strive to achieve an injury-free work environment. We also continue to invest in emerging technologies to protect our employees from injuries, including leveraging fleet telematics and distracted driving technology, resulting in reductions in road traffic accidents, and deploying wearable ergonomic risk reduction devices. In addition, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have remained focused on the health and safety of our associates, especially our frontline associates who continue to make, move and sell our products during this critical time, including by continuing to implement various safety protocols in our facilities, providing personal protective equipment and enabling testing. 10 Table of Contents We believe that our culture of diversity, equity and inclusion is a competitive advantage that fuels innovation, enhances our ability to attract and retain talent and strengthens our reputation. We continually strive to improve the attraction, retention, and advancement of diverse associates to ensure we sustain a high-caliber pipeline of talent that also represents the communities we serve. As of December 25, 2021, our global workforce was approximately 27% female, while management roles were approximately 43% female. As of December 25, 2021, approximately 45% of our U.S. workforce was comprised of racially/ethnically diverse individuals, of which approximately 31% of our U.S. associates in managerial roles were racially/ethnically diverse individuals. Direct reports of our Chief Executive Officer include 7 executives globally who are racially/ethnically diverse and/or female. We are also committed to the continued growth and development of our associates. PepsiCo supports and develops its associates through a variety of global training and development programs that build and strengthen employees' leadership and professional skills, including career development plans, mentoring programs and in-house learning opportunities, such as PEP U Degreed, our internal global online learning resource. In 2021, PepsiCo employees completed over 1,000,000 hours of training.

The following risks, some of which have occurred and any of which may occur in the future, can have a material adverse effect on our business or financial performance, which in turn can affect the price of our publicly traded securities. These are not the only risks we face. There may be other risks we are not currently aware of or that we currently deem not to be material but that may become material in the future. Business Risks The impact of COVID-19 continues to create considerable uncertainty for our business. Our global operations continue to expose us to risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Numerous measures have been implemented around the world to try to reduce the spread of the virus and these measures have impacted and continue to impact us, our business partners and consumers. 11 Table of Contents We have seen and could continue to see changes in consumer demand as a result of COVID-19, including the inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine or other restrictions, store closures, or financial hardship. We also have seen and could continue to see shifts in product and channel prefe rences, including an increase in demand in the e-commerce channel, which has impacted and could continue to impact our sales and profitability. Reduced demand for our products or changes in consumer purchasing patterns, as well as continued economic uncertainty, can adversely affect our customers’ financial condition, which can result in bankruptcy filings and/or an inability to pay for our products. In addition, we may also continue to experience business disruptions as a result of COVID-19, resulting from temporary closures of our facilities or facilities of our business partners or the inability of a significant portion of our or our business partners’ workforce to work because of illness, absenteeism, quarantine, vaccine mandates, or travel or other governmental restrictions. In addition, we and our business partners may also continue to see adverse impacts to our supply chain as a result of COVID-19 through raw material, packaging or other supply shortages, labor shortages or reduced availability of air or other commercial transport, port congestion and closures or border restrictions, any of which can impact our business. Any sustained interruption in our or our business partners’ operations, distribution network or supply chain or any significant continuous shortage of raw materials, packaging or other supplies can negatively impact our business. We have also incurred, and could continue to incur, increased employee and operating costs as a result of COVID-19, such as costs related to expanded benefits and frontline incentives, the provision of personal protective equipment and increased sanitation, allowances for credit losses, upfront payment reserves and inventory write-offs, and cost inflation in commodities, packaging, transportation and other input costs, which have negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact our profitability. In addition, the increase in certain of our employees working remotely has resulted in increased demand on our information technology infrastructure, which can be subject to failure, disruption or unavailability, and increased vulnerability to cyberattacks and other cyber incidents. Also, continued economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in volatility in the global capital and credit markets which can impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. The impact of COVID-19 has heightened, or in some cases manifested, certain of the other risks discussed below. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business remains uncertain and will continue to depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict and which will vary by jurisdiction and market, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, the emergence and spread of new variants of the virus, including the omicron and delta variants, the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, the speed at which vaccines are administered, the efficacy of vaccines against the virus and evolving strains or variants of the virus, global economic conditions during and after the pandemic, governmental actions that have been taken, or may be taken in the future, in response to the pandemic, and changes in consumer behavior in response to the pandemic, some of which may be more than just temporary. Reduction in future demand for our products would adversely affect our business. Demand for our products depends in part on our ability to innovate and anticipate and effectively respond to shifts in consumer trends and preferences, including the types of products our consumers want and how they browse for, purchase and consume them. Consumer preferences continuously evolve due to a variety of factors, including: changes in consumer demographics, consumption patterns and channel preferences (including continued increases in the e-commerce and online-to-offline channels); pricing; product quality; concerns or perceptions regarding packaging and its environmental impact (such as single-use and other plastic packaging); and concerns or perceptions regarding the nutrition profile and health effects of, or location of origin of, ingredients or substances in our products or packaging, including due to the results of third-party studies (whether or not scientifically valid). Concerns with any of the foregoing could lead consumers to reduce or publicly boycott the purchase or consumption of our products. Consumer 12 Table of Contents preferences are also influenced by perception of our brand image or the brand images of our products, the success of our advertising and marketing campaigns, our ability to engage with our consumers in the manner they prefer, including through the use of digital media or assets, and the perception of our use, and the use of social media. These and other factors have reduced in the past and could continue to reduce consumers’ willingness to purchase certain of our products. Any inability on our part to anticipate or react to changes in consumer preferences and trends, or make the right strategic investments to do so, including investments in data analytics to understand consumer trends, can lead to reduced demand for our products, lead to inventory write-offs or erode our competitive and financial position, thereby adversely affecting our business. In addition, our business operations, including our supply chain, are subject to disruption by natural disasters or other events beyond our control that could negatively impact product availability and decrease demand for our products if our crisis management plans do not effectively resolve these issues. Damage to our reputation or brand image can adversely affect our business. Maintaining a positive reputation globally is critical to selling our products. Our reputation or brand image has in the past been, and could in the future be, adversely impacted by a variety of factors, including: any failure by us or our business partners to maintain high ethical, business and environmental, social and governance practices, including with respect to human rights, child labor laws, diversity, equity and inclusion, workplace conditions and employee health and safety; any failure to achieve our environmental, social and governance goals, including with respect to the nutrition profile of our products, diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, packaging, water use and our impact on the environment; any failure to address health concerns about our products, products we distribute, or particular ingredients in our products, including concerns regarding whether certain of our products contribute to obesity or an increase in public health costs; our research and development efforts; any product quality or safety issues, including the recall of any of our products; any failure to comply with laws and regulations; consumer perception of our advertising campaigns, sponsorship arrangements, marketing programs, use of social media and our response to political and social issues or catastrophic events; or any failure to effectively respond to negative or inaccurate comments about us on social media or otherwise regarding any of the foregoing. Damage to our reputation or brand image has in the past and could in the future decrease demand for our products, thereby adversely affecting our business. Product recalls or other issues or concerns with respect to product quality and safety can adversely affect our business. We have and could in the future recall products due to product quality or safety issues, including actual or alleged mislabeling, misbranding, spoilage, undeclared allergens, adulteration or contamination. Product recalls have in the past and could in the future adversely affect our business by resulting in losses due to their cost, the destruction of product inventory or lost sales due to any unavailability of the product for a period of time. In addition, product quality or safety issues, whether as a result of failure to comply with food safety laws or otherwise, have in the past and could in the future also reduce consumer confidence and demand for our products, cause production and delivery disruptions, and result in increased costs (including payment of fines and/or judgments) and damage our reputation, particularly as we expand into new categories, such as nuts and meat convenient foods globally and the distribution of alcoholic beverages in the United States, all of which can adversely affect our business. Failure to maintain adequate oversight over product quality or safety can result in product recalls, litigation, government investigations or inquiries or civil or criminal proceedings, all of which may result in fines, penalties, damages or criminal liability. Our business can also be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in product quality, safety and integrity generally, even if such loss of confidence is unrelated to products in our portfolio. 13 Table of Contents Any inability to compete effectively can adversely affect our business. Our products compete against products of international beverage and convenient food companies that, like us, operate in multiple geographies, as well as regional, local and private label and economy brand manufacturers and other competitors, including smaller companies developing and selling micro brands directly to consumers through e-commerce platforms or through retailers focused on locally sourced products. In many countries in which our products are sold, including the United States, The Coca-Cola Company is our primary beverage competitor. Our products compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition and loyalty, taste, price, value, quality, product variety, innovation, distribution, advertising, marketing and promotional activity, packaging, convenience, service and the ability to anticipate and effectively respond to consumer preferences and trends. Our business can be adversely affected if we are unable to effectively promote or develop our existing products or introduce and effectively market new products, if we are unable to effectively adopt new technologies, including artificial intelligence and data analytics to develop new commercial insights and improve operating efficiencies, if we are unable to continuously strengthen and evolve our capabilities in digital marketing, if our competitors spend more aggressively than we do or if we are otherwise unable to effectively respond to supply disruptions, pricing pressure (including as a result of commodity inflation) or otherwise compete effectively, and we may be unable to grow or maintain sales or category share or we may need to increase capital, marketing or other expenditures. Failure to attract, develop and maintain a highly skilled and diverse workforce can have an adverse effect on our business. Our business requires that we attract, develop and maintain a highly skilled and diverse workforce. Our employees are highly sought after by our competitors and other companies and our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract, retain, develop and motivate highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Any unplanned turnover, sustained labor shortage or unsuccessful implementation of our succession plans to backfill current leadership positions, including the Chief Executive Officer, or failure to attract, develop and maintain a highly skilled and diverse workforce, including with key capabilities such as e-commerce and digital marketing and data analytic skills, can deplete our institutional knowledge base, erode our competitive advantage or result in increased costs due to increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs. In addition, failure to attract, retain and develop associates from underrepresented communities can damage our business results and our reputation. Any of the foregoing can adversely affect our business. Water scarcity can adversely affect our business. We and our business partners use water in the manufacturing and sourcing of our products. Water is also essential to the production of the raw materials needed in our manufacturing process. Lack of available water of acceptable quality, increasing focus by governmental and non-governmental organizations, investors, customers and consumers on water scarcity and increasing pressure to conserve and replenish water in areas of scarcity and stress, including due to the effects of climate change, may lead to: supply chain disruption; adverse effects on our operations or the operations of our business partners; higher compliance costs; capital expenditures (including investments in the development of technologies to enhance water efficiency and reduce consumption); higher production costs, including less favorable pricing for water; the interruption or cessation of operations at, or relocation of, our facilities or the facilities of our business partners; failure to achieve our goals relating to water use; perception of our failure to act responsibly with respect to water use or to effectively respond to legal or regulatory requirements concerning water scarcity; or damage to our reputation, any of which can adversely affect our business. 14 Table of Contents Changes in the retail landscape or in sales to any key customer can adversely affect our business. The retail landscape continues to evolve, including continued growth in e-commerce channels and hard discounters. Our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain and develop successful relationships with e-commerce retailers and hard discounters, while also maintaining relationships with our key customers operating in traditional retail channels (many of whom are also focused on increasing their e-commerce sales). Our business can be adversely affected if e-commerce channels and hard discounters take significant additional market share away from traditional retailers or we fail to find ways to create increasingly better digital tools and capabilities for our retail customers to enable them to grow their businesses. In addition, our business can be adversely affected if we are unable to profitably expand our own direct-to-consumer e-commerce capabilities. The retail industry is also impacted by increased consolidation of ownership and purchasing power, particularly in North America, Europe and Latin America, resulting in large retailers or buying groups with increased purchasing power, impacting our ability to compete in these areas. Consolidation also adversely impacts our smaller customers’ ability to compete effectively, resulting in an inability on their part to pay for our products or reduced or canceled orders of our products. Further, we must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers, including Walmart, to compete effectively. Any inability to resolve a significant dispute with any of our key customers, a change in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of any of our key customers, even if unrelated to us, a significant reduction in sales to any key customer, or the loss of any of our key customers can adversely affect our business. Disruption of our manufacturing operations or supply chain, including increased commodity, packaging, transportation, labor and other input costs, can adversely affect our business. We have experienced and could continue to experience disruption in our manufacturing operations and supply chain. Many of the raw materials and supplies used in the production of our products are sourced from countries experiencing civil unrest, political instability or unfavorable economic conditions. Some raw materials and supplies, including packaging materials, are available only from a limited number of suppliers or from a sole supplier or are in short supply when seasonal demand is at its peak. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain favorable arrangements and relationships with suppliers or that our contingency plans will be effective to prevent disruptions that may arise from shortages or discontinuation of any raw materials and other supplies that we use in the manufacture, production and distribution of our products. Any sustained or significant disruption to the manufacturing or sourcing of products or materials could increase our costs and interrupt product supply, which can adversely impact our business. The raw materials and other supplies, including agricultural commodities, fuel and packaging materials, such as recycled PET, transportation, labor and other supply chain inputs that we use for the manufacturing, production and distribution of our products are subject to price volatility and fluctuations in availability caused by many factors, including changes in supply and demand, supplier capacity constraints, inflation, weather conditions (including potential effects of climate change), fire, natural disasters, disease or pests (including the impact of greening disease on the citrus industry), agricultural uncertainty, health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks (including COVID-19), labor shortages (including the lack of availability of truck drivers or as a result of COVID-19), strikes or work stoppages, governmental incentives and controls (including import/export restrictions, such as new or increased tariffs, sanctions, quotas or trade barriers), port congestions or delays, transport capacity constraints, cybersecurity incidents or other disruptions, loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites, political uncertainties, acts of terrorism, governmental instability or currency exchange rates. Many of our raw materials and supplies are purchased in the open market and the prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation. We experienced higher than anticipated commodity, packaging and transportation costs during 2021, which may continue. When input prices increase unexpectedly or significantly, we may 15 Table of Contents be unwilling or unable to increase our product prices or unable to effectively hedge against price increases to offset these increased costs without suffering reduced volume, revenue, margins and operating results. Political and social conditions can adversely affect our business. Political and social conditions in the markets in which our products are sold have been and could continue to be difficult to predict, resulting in adverse effects on our business. The results of elections, referendums or other political conditions (including government shutdowns or hostilities between countries) in these markets have in the past and could continue to impact how existing laws, regulations and government programs or policies are implemented or result in uncertainty as to how such laws, regulations, programs or policies may change, including with respect to tariffs, sanctions, environmental and climate change regulations, taxes, benefit programs, the movement of goods, services and people between countries, relationships between countries, customer or consumer perception of a particular country or its government and other matters, and has resulted in and could continue to result in exchange rate fluctuation, volatility in global stock markets and global economic uncertainty or adversely affect demand for our products, any of which can adversely affect our business. In addition, political and social conditions in certain cities throughout the U.S. as well as globally have resulted in demonstrations and protests, including in connection with political elections and civil rights and liberties. Our operations, including the distribution of our products and the ingredients or other raw materials used in the production of our products, may be disrupted if such events persist for a prolonged period of time, including due to actions taken by governmental authorities in affected cities and regions, which can adversely affect our business. Our business can be adversely affected if we are unable to grow in developing and emerging markets. Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business in developing and emerging markets, including Mexico, Russia, the Middle East, China, South Africa, Brazil and India. There can be no assurance that our products will be accepted or be successful in any particular developing or emerging market, due to competition, price, cultural differences, consumer preferences, method of distribution or otherwise. Our business in these markets has been and could continue in the future to be impacted by economic, political and social conditions; acts of war, terrorist acts, and civil unrest, including demonstrations and protests; competition; tariffs, sanctions or other regulations restricting contact with certain countries in these markets; foreign ownership restrictions; nationalization of our assets or the assets of our business partners; government-mandated closure, or threatened closure, of our operations or the operations of our business partners; restrictions on the import or export of our products or ingredients or substances used in our products; highly inflationary economies; devaluation or fluctuation or demonetization of currency; regulations on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, currency controls or other currency exchange restrictions, which result in significant cash balances in foreign countries, from time to time, or can significantly affect our ability to effectively manage our operations in certain of these markets and can result in the deconsolidation of such businesses; the lack of well-established or reliable legal systems; increased costs of doing business due to compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act; and adverse consequences, such as the assessment of fines or penalties, for any failure to comply with laws and regulations. Our business can be adversely affected if we are unable to expand our business in developing and emerging markets, effectively operate, or manage the risks associated with operating, in these markets, or achieve the return on capital we expect from our investments in these markets. Changes in economic conditions can adversely impact our business. Many of the jurisdictions in which our products are sold have experienced and could continue to experience uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions, such as recessions or economic slowdowns, 16 Table of Contents which have and could continue to result in adverse changes in interest rates, tax laws or tax rates; inflation; volatile commodity markets; labor shortages; highly inflationary economies, devaluation, fluctuation or demonetization of currency; contraction in the availability of credit; austerity or stimulus measures; the effects of any default by or deterioration in the creditworthiness of the countries in which our products are sold; or a decrease in the fair value of pension or post-retirement assets that could increase future employee benefit costs and/or funding requirements of our pension or post-retirement plans. In addition, we cannot predict how current or future economic conditions will affect our business partners, including financial institutions with whom we do business, and any negative impact on any of the foregoing may also have an adverse impact on our business. Future cyber incidents and other disruptions to our information systems can adversely affect our business. We depend on information systems and technology, including public websites and cloud-based services, for many activities important to our business, including communications within our company, interfacing with customers and consumers; ordering and managing inventory; managing and operating our facilities; protecting confidential information, including personal data we collect; maintaining accurate financial records and complying with regulatory, financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. Our business has in the past and could in the future be negatively affected by system shutdowns, degraded systems performance, systems disruptions or security incidents. These disruptions or incidents may be caused by cyberattacks and other cyber incidents, network or power outages, software, equipment or telecommunications failures, the unintentional or malicious actions of employees or contractors, natural disasters, fires or other catastrophic events. Cyberattacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently, the techniques used to gain access to information technology systems and data, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems are constantly evolving and becoming more sophisticated in nature and are being carried out by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives. Cyberattacks and cyber incidents may be difficult to detect for periods of time and take many forms including cyber extortion, denial of service, social engineering, introduction of viruses or malware (such as ransomware), exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware, software or other infrastructure, hacking, website defacement or theft of passwords and other credentials, unauthorized use of computing resources for digital currency mining and business email compromise. As with other global companies, we are regularly subject to cyberattacks and other cyber incidents, including the types of attacks and incidents described above. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to continue building and maintaining our information technology infrastructure, or if we fail to timely identify or appropriately respond to cyberattacks or other cyber incidents, our business has been and can continue to be adversely affected, which has resulted in and can continue to result in some or all of the following: transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, inability to access our data or systems, lost revenues or other costs resulting from disruptions or shutdowns of offices, plants, warehouses, distribution centers or other facilities, intellectual property or other data loss, litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations, fines or penalties, remediation costs, damage to our reputation or a negative impact on employee morale and the loss of current or potential customers. Similar risks exist with respect to third-party providers, including suppliers, software and cloud-based service providers, that we rely upon for aspects of our information technology support services and administrative functions, including payroll processing, health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions, and the systems managed, hosted, provided and/or used by such third parties and their vendors. For example, malicious actors have employed and could continue to employ the information technology supply chain to introduce malware through software updates or compromised supplier accounts or hardware. The need to coordinate with various third-party service providers, including with respect to timely notification and access to personnel and information concerning an incident, may complicate our efforts to resolve issues that arise. As a result, we are subject to the risk that 17 Table of Contents the activities associated with our third-party service providers can adversely affect our business even if the attack or breach does not directly impact our systems or information. Although the cyber incidents and other systems disruptions that we have experienced to date have not had a material effect on our business, such incidents or disruptions could have a material adverse effect on us in the future. While we devote significant resources to network security, disaster recovery, employee training and other measures to secure our information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of data, there are no guarantees that they will be adequate to safeguard against all cyber incidents, systems disruptions, system compromises or misuses of data. In addition, while we currently maintain insurance coverage that, subject to its terms and conditions, is intended to address costs associated with certain aspects of cyber incidents and information systems failures, this insurance coverage may not, depending on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding an incident, cover all losses or all types of claims that arise from an incident, or the damage to our reputation or brands that may result from an incident. Failure to successfully complete or manage strategic transactions can adversely affect our business. We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and evaluate potential acquisitions, joint ventures, distribution agreements, divestitures, refranchisings and other strategic transactions. The success of these transactions, including the recent completion of the Juice Transaction, is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to realize the full extent of the expected returns, benefits, cost savings or synergies as a result of a transaction, within the anticipated time frame, or at all; and receipt of necessary consents, clearances and approvals. Risks associated with strategic transactions include integrating manufacturing, distribution, sales, accounting, financial reporting and administrative support activities and information technology systems with our company or difficulties separating such personnel, activities and systems in connection with divestitures; operating through new business models or in new categories or territories; motivating, recruiting and retaining executives and key employees; conforming controls (including internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures) and policies (including with respect to environmental compliance, health and safety compliance and compliance with anti-bribery laws); retaining existing customers and consumers and attracting new customers and consumers; managing tax costs or inefficiencies; maintaining good relations with divested or refranchised businesses in our supply or sales chain; inability to offset loss of revenue associated with divested brands or businesses; managing the impact of business decisions or other actions or omissions of our joint venture partners that may have different interests than we do; and other unanticipated problems or liabilities, such as contingent liabilities and litigation. Strategic transactions that are not successfully completed or managed effectively, or our failure to effectively manage the risks associated with such transactions, have in the past and could continue to result in adverse effects on our business. Our reliance on third-party service providers and enterprise-wide systems can have an adverse effect on our business. We rely on third-party service providers, including cloud data service providers, for certain areas of our business, including payroll processing, health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions. Failure by these third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory and other obligations to us, or our failure to adequately monitor their performance, has in the past and could continue to result in our inability to achieve the expected cost savings or efficiencies and result in additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers. Depending on the function involved, such errors can also lead to business disruption, systems performance degradation, processing inefficiencies or other systems disruptions, the loss of or damage to intellectual property or sensitive data through security breaches or otherwise, incorrect or adverse effects on financial reporting, litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations, fines or penalties, remediation costs, 18 Table of Contents damage to our reputation or have a negative impact on employee morale, all of which can adversely affect our business. In addition, we continue on our multi-year phased business transformation initiative to migrate certain of our systems, including our financial processing systems, to enterprise-wide systems solutions and have begun to roll out these systems in certain countries and divisions. We have experienced and could continue to experience systems outages and operating inefficiencies following these planned implementations. In addition, if we do not continue to allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper information technology infrastructure, or if we fail to achieve the expected benefits from this initiative, our business could be adversely affected. Climate change or measures to address climate change can negatively affect our business or damage our reputation. Climate change may have a negative effect on agricultural productivity which may result in decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as potatoes, sugar cane, corn, wheat, rice, oats, oranges and other fruits (and fruit-derived oils). In addition, climate change may also increase the frequency or severity of natural disasters and other extreme weather conditions (including rising temperatures and drought), which could pose physical risks to our facilities, impair our production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products. Also, there is an increased focus in many jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold regarding environmental policies relating to climate change, regulating greenhouse gas emissions, energy policies and sustainability, including single-use plastics. This increased focus may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements, such as potential carbon pricing programs, which could result in significant increased costs and require additional investments in facilities and equipment. As a result, the effects of climate change can negatively affect our business and operations. In addition, any failure to achieve our goals with respect to reducing our impact on the environment or perception of a failure to act responsibly with respect to the environment or to effectively respond to regulatory requirements concerning climate change can lead to adverse publicity, which could adversely affect demand for our products or damage our reputation. Any of the foregoing can adversely affect our business. Strikes or work stoppages can cause our business to suffer. Many of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and other employees may seek to be covered by collective bargaining agreements. Strikes or work stoppages or other business interruptions have occurred and may occur in the future if we are unable to renew, or enter into new, collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms and can impair manufacturing and distribution of our products, lead to a loss of sales, increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully implement future operational changes to enhance our efficiency or to adapt to changing business needs or strategy, all of which can adversely affect our business. Financial Risks Failure to realize benefits from our productivity initiatives can adversely affect our financial performance. Our future growth depends, in part, on our ability to continue to reduce costs and improve efficiencies, including our multi-year phased implementation of shared business service organizational models. We continue to identify and implement productivity initiatives that we believe will position our business for long-term sustainable growth by allowing us to achieve a lower cost structure, improve decision-making and operate more efficiently. Some of these measures result in unintended consequences, such as business disruptions, distraction of management and employees, reduced morale and productivity, unexpected 19 Table of Contents employee attrition, an inability to attract or retain key personnel and negative publicity. If we are unable to successfully implement our productivity initiatives as planned or do not achieve expected savings as a result of these initiatives, we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits, resulting in adverse effects on our financial performance. A deterioration in our estimates and underlying assumptions regarding the future performance of our business can result in an impairment charge that can adversely affect our results of operations. We conduct impairment tests on our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. In addition, amortizable intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. A deterioration in our underlying assumptions regarding the impact of competitive operating conditions, macroeconomic conditions or other factors used to estimate the future performance of any of our reporting units or assets, including any deterioration in the weighted-average cost of capital based on market data available at the time, can result in an impairment charge, which can adversely affect our results of operations. Fluctuations in exchange rates impact our financial performance. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the United States, where the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar, are translated into U.S. dollars. Given our global operations, we also pay for the ingredients, raw materials and commodities used in our business in numerous currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates, including as a result of inflation, central bank monetary policies, currency controls or other currency exchange restrictions have had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on our financial performance. Our borrowing costs and access to capital and credit markets can be adversely affected by a downgrade or potential downgrade of our credit ratings. Rating agencies routinely evaluate us and their ratings are based on a number of factors, including our cash generating capability, levels of indebtedness, policies with respect to shareholder distributions and our financial strength generally, as well as factors beyond our control, such as the state of the economy and our industry. We expect to maintain Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global credit markets at favorable interest rates. Any downgrade or announcement that we are under review for a potential downgrade of our credit ratings, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, can increase our future borrowing costs, impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all, result in a reduction in our liquidity, or impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically (and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing), all of which can adversely affect our financial performance. Legal, Tax and Regulatory Risks Taxes aimed at our products can adversely affect our business or financial performance. Certain jurisdictions in which our products are sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes on the manufacture, distribution or sale of certain of our products, particularly our beverages, as a result of the ingredients or substances contained in our products. These taxes vary in scope and form: some apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). Similarly, some measures apply a single tax rate per ounce/liter on beverages containing over a certain amount of added sugar (or other sweetener), some apply a graduated tax rate depending upon the amount of added sugar (or other sweetener) in the beverage and others apply a flat tax rate on beverages containing any amount of added sugar (or other sweetener). For example, certain provinces in Canada enacted a flat tax on all sugar-sweetened beverages, effective 20 Table of Contents September 1, 2022, at a rate of 0.20 Canadian dollars (0.16 U.S. dollars) per liter . These tax measures, whatever their scope or form, have in the past and could continue to increase the cost of certain of our products, reduce overall consumption of our products or lead to negative publicity, resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial performance. Limitations on the marketing or sale of our products can adversely affect our business and financial performance. Certain jurisdictions in which our products are sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, limitations on the marketing or sale of our products as a result of ingredients or substances in our products. These limitations require that we highlight perceived concerns about a product, warn consumers to avoid consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in our products, restrict the age of consumers to whom products are marketed or sold or limit the location in which our products may be available. For example, Argentina and Colombia enacted warning labeling requirements in 2021 to indicate whether a particular pre-packaged food or beverage product is considered to be high in sugar, sodium or saturated fat. Certain jurisdictions have imposed or are considering imposing color-coded labeling requirements where colors such as red, yellow and green are used to indicate various levels of a particular ingredient, such as sugar, sodium or saturated fat, in products. The imposition or proposed imposition of additional limitations on the marketing or sale of our products has in the past and could continue to reduce overall consumption of our products, lead to negative publicity or leave consumers with the perception that our products do not meet their health and wellness needs, resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial performance. Laws and regulations related to the use or disposal of plastics or other packaging materials can adversely affect our business and financial performance. We rely on diverse packaging solutions to safely deliver products to our customers and consumers. Certain of our products are sold in packaging designed to be recyclable or commercially compostable. However, not all packaging is recycled, whether due to lack of infrastructure or otherwise, and certain of our packaging is not currently recyclable. Packaging waste not properly disposed of that displays one or more of our brands has in the past resulted in and could continue to result in negative publicity, litigation or reduced consumer demand for our products, adversely affecting our financial performance. Many jurisdictions in which our products are sold have imposed or are considering imposing regulations or policies intended to encourage the use of sustainable packaging, waste reduction or increased recycling rates or to restrict the sale of products utilizing certain packaging. These regulations vary in form and scope and include extended producer responsibility policies, plastic or packaging taxes, restrictions on certain products and materials, requirements for bottle caps to be tethered to bottles, bans on the use of single-use plastics and requirements to charge deposit fees. For example, the European Union, Peru and certain states in the United States, among other jurisdictions, have imposed a minimum recycled content requirement for beverage bottle packaging and similar legislation is under consideration in other jurisdictions. These laws and regulations have in the past and could continue to increase the cost of our products, impact demand for our products, result in negative publicity and require us and our business partners, including our independent bottlers, to increase capital expenditures to invest in minimizing the amount of plastic or other materials used in our packaging or to develop alternative packaging, all of which can adversely affect our business and financial performance. Failure to comply with personal data protection and privacy laws can adversely affect our business. We are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions regarding personal data protection and privacy laws. These laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country or, within the United States, from state to state, and can create inconsistent or conflicting requirements. Our efforts to comply with these laws and 21 Table of Contents regulations, including with respect to data from residents of the European Union who are covered by the General Data Protection Regulation or residents of the state of California who are covered by the California Consumer Privacy Act (as modified by the California Privacy Rights Act), impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to continue to increase over time, particularly as additional jurisdictions adopt similar regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations or to otherwise protect personal data from unauthorized access, use or other processing, have in the past and could in the future result in litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations, damage to our reputation, fines or penalties, all of which can adversely affect our business. Increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or disagreements with tax authorities can adversely affect our financial performance. Increases in income tax rates or other changes in tax laws, including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, can adversely affect our financial performance. For example, economic and political conditions in countries where we are subject to taxes, including the United States, have in the past and could continue to result in significant changes in tax legislation or regulation, including those proposed and under consideration by the United States Congress and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. For example, numerous countries have recently agreed to a statement in support of a global minimum tax rate of 15% as well as global profit reallocation. There can be no assurance that these changes will be adopted by individual countries, or that once adopted by individual countries, that they will not have adverse effects on our financial performance. This increasingly complex global tax environment has in the past and could continue to increase tax uncertainty, resulting in higher compliance costs and adverse effects on our financial performance. We are also subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by numerous taxing authorities with respect to income and non-income based taxes. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in jurisdictions in which we operate, or the adoption of new or reformed tax legislation or regulation, has made and could continue to make resolving tax disputes more difficult and the final resolution of tax audits and any related litigation can differ from our historical provisions and accruals, resulting in an adverse effect on our financial performance. If we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, or if we are found to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, our business can be adversely affected. We possess intellectual property rights that are important to our business, including ingredient formulas, trademarks, copyrights, patents, business processes and other trade secrets. The laws of various jurisdictions in which we operate have differing levels of protection of intellectual property. Our competitive position and the value of our products and brands can be reduced and our business adversely affected if we fail to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property, including our ingredient formulas, or if there is a change in law that limits or removes the current legal protections afforded our intellectual property. Also, in the course of developing new products or improving the quality of existing products, we have in the past infringed or been alleged to have infringed, and could in the future infringe or be alleged to infringe, on the intellectual property rights of others. Such infringement or allegations of infringement could result in expensive litigation and damages, damage to our reputation, disruption to our operations, injunctions against development, manufacturing, use and/or sale of certain products, inventory write-offs or other limitations on our ability to introduce new products or improve the quality of existing products, resulting in an adverse effect on our business. Failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our business can adversely affect our business. The conduct of our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the production, storage, distribution, sale, display, advertising, marketing, labeling, content (including whether a product 22 Table of Contents contains genetically engineered ingredients), quality, safety, transportation, traceability, sourcing (including pesticide use), packaging, disposal, recycling and use of our products or raw materials, employment and occupational health and safety, environmental, social and governance matters (including climate change) and data privacy and protection. In addition, in many jurisdictions, compliance with competition laws is of special importance to us due to our competitive position, as is compliance with anti-corruption laws. The imposition of new laws, changes in laws or regulatory requirements or changing interpretations thereof, and differing or competing regulations and standards across the markets where our products or raw materials are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, have in the past and could continue to result in higher compliance costs, capital expenditures and higher production costs, resulting in adverse effects on our business. For example, increasing governmental and societal attention to environmental, social and governance matters has resulted and could continue to result in new laws or regulatory requirements. In addition, the entry into new markets or categories, including our planned entry into the alcoholic beverage industry as a distributor in the United States and expansion into the nuts and meat convenient foods categories globally, has resulted in and could continue to result in our business being subject to additional regulations resulting in higher compliance costs. If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new laws or regulations that impact the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products, other jurisdictions may follow. Failure to comply with such laws or regulations can subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions, including fines, injunctions, product recalls, penalties, disgorgement of profits or activity restrictions, all of which can adversely affect our business. In addition, the results of third-party studies (whether or not scientifically valid) purporting to assess the health implications of consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in certain of our products or packaging materials have resulted in and could continue to result in our being subject to new taxes and regulations or lawsuits that can adversely affect our business. Potential liabilities and costs from litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations can have an adverse impact on our business. We and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations, including but not limited to matters related to our advertising, marketing or commercial practices, product labels, claims and ingredients, personal injury and property damage, intellectual property rights, privacy, employment, tax and insurance matters, environmental, social and governance matters and matters relating to our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. These matters are inherently uncertain and there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves or that our assessment of the materiality of these matters and the likely outcome or potential losses and established reserves will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such matters. Responding to these matters, even those that are ultimately non-meritorious, requires us to incur significant expense and devote significant resources, and may generate adverse publicity that damages our reputation or brand image. Any of the foregoing can adversely affect our business. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. We have received no written comments regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff of the SEC that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of our 2021 year and that remain unresolved. 23 Table of Contents Item 2. Properties. Our principal executive office located in Purchase, New York and our facilities located in Plano, Texas, all of which we own, are our most significant corporate properties. In connection with making, marketing, distributing and selling our products, each division utilizes manufacturing, processing, bottling and production plants, warehouses, distribution centers, storage facilities, offices, including division headquarters, research and development facilities and other facilities, all of which are either owned or leased. Significant properties by division are as follows: Property Type Location Owned/ Leased FLNA Research and development facility Plano, Texas Owned QFNA Convenient food plant Cedar Rapids, Iowa Owned PBNA Research and development facility Valhalla, New York Owned PBNA Concentrate plant Arlington, Texas Owned PBNA Tropicana plant (a) Bradenton, Florida Owned LatAm Convenient food plant Celaya, Mexico Owned LatAm Two convenient food plants Vallejo, Mexico Owned Europe Convenient food plant Kashira, Russia Owned Europe Manufacturing plant Lehavim, Israel Owned Europe Dairy plant Moscow, Russia Owned (b) AMESA Convenient food plant Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Owned (b) APAC Convenient food plant Wuhan, China Owned (b) FLNA, QFNA, PBNA Shared service center Winston Salem, North Carolina Leased PBNA, LatAm Concentrate plant Colonia, Uruguay Owned (b) PBNA, Europe, AMESA Two concentrate plants Cork, Ireland Owned PBNA, AMESA, APAC Concentrate plant Singapore Owned (b) All divisions Shared service center Hyderabad, India Leased (a) As of December 25, 2021, this property was reclassified as held for sale on the consolidated balance sheet in connection with our Juice Transaction.

Most of our plants are owned or leased on a long-term basis. In addition to company-owned or leased properties described above, we also utilize a highly distributed network of plants, warehouses and distribution centers that are owned or leased by our contract manufacturers, co-packers, strategic alliances or joint ventures in which we have an equity interest. We believe that our properties generally are in good operating condition and, taken as a whole, are suitable, adequate and of sufficient capacity for our current operations. Item 3. Legal Proceedings. We and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations. While the results of such litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the final outcome of the foregoing will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

On February 2, 2022, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $1.075 per share payable March 31, 2022, to shareholders of record on March 4, 2022. For the remainder of 2022, the record dates for these dividend payments are expected to be June 3, September 2 and December 2, 2022, subject to approval of the Board of Directors. On February 10, 2022, we announced a 7% increase in our annualized dividend to $4.60 per share from $4.30 per share, effective with the dividend expected to be paid in June 2022. Additionally, on February 10, 2022, we announced a share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $10.0 billion of PepsiCo common stock commencing on February 11, 2022 and expiring on February 28, 2026 (2022 share repurchase program). Shares repurchased under this program may be repurchased in open market transactions, in privately negotiated transactions, in accelerated stock repurchase transactions or otherwise. We expect to return a total of approximately $7.7 billion to shareholders in 2022, comprising dividends of approximately $6.2 billion and share repurchases of approximately $1.5 billion.

OUR BUSINESS Executive Overview PepsiCo is a leading global beverage and convenient food company with a complementary portfolio of brands, including Lays, Doritos, Cheetos, Gatorade, Pepsi-Cola, Mountain Dew, Quaker and SodaStream. Through our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a wide variety of beverages and convenient foods, serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories. As a global company with deep local ties, we faced many of the same challenges in 2021 as our consumers, customers, and competitors across the world, including the second year of the COVID-19 pandemic; a worsening climate crisis; supply chain disruptions; inflationary pressures; shifting consumer preferences and behaviors; a highly competitive operating environment; a rapidly changing retail landscape, including the growth in e-commerce; continued macroeconomic and political volatility; and an evolving regulatory landscape. To meet the challenges of today – and those of tomorrow – we are driven by an approach called PepsiCo Positive (pep+). pep+ is a strategic end-to-end transformation of our business, with sustainability at the center of how the company will strive to create growth and value by operating within planetary boundaries and inspiring positive change for the planet and people. pep+ will guide how we will work to transform our business operations, from sourcing ingredients and making and selling products in a more sustainable way, to leveraging our more than one billion connections with consumers each day to take sustainability mainstream and engage people to make choices that are better for themselves and the planet. pep+ drives action and progress across three key pillars, bringing together a number of industry-leading 2030 sustainability goals under a comprehensive framework: • Positive Agriculture : We are working to spread regenerative practices to restore the Earth across land equal to the company's entire agricultural footprint (approximately 7 million acres), sustainably source key crops and ingredients, and improve the livelihoods of more people in our agricultural supply chain. • Positive Value Chain : We are working to build a circular and inclusive value chain through actions to: achieve net-zero emissions by 2040; become net water positive by 2030; and introduce more sustainable packaging into the value chain. Our packaging goals include cutting virgin plastic per serving, using recycled content in our plastic packaging, and scaling our SodaStream business globally, an innovative platform that almost entirely eliminates the need for beverage packaging, among other levers. Additionally, we are making progress on our diversity, equity and inclusion journey. And we have introduced a new global workforce volunteering program, One Smile at a 30 Table of Contents Time, to encourage, support and empower each one of our approximately 309,000 employees to make positive impacts in their local communities. • Positive Choices : We continue working to evolve our portfolio of beverage and convenient food products so that they are better for the planet and people, including by incorporating more diverse ingredients in both new and existing food products that are better for the planet and/or deliver nutritional benefits, prioritizing chickpeas, plant-based proteins and whole grains; expanding our position in the nuts & seeds category, where PepsiCo is already the global branded leader, including leadership positions in Mexico, China and several Western European markets; and accelerating our reduction of added sugars and sodium through the use of science-based targets across our portfolio and cooking our food offerings with healthier oils. We are also continuing to scale new business models that require little or no single-use packaging, including SodaStream – an icon of a Positive Choice and the largest sparkling water brand in the world by volume. SodaStream, already sold in more than 40 countries, and its new SodaStream Professional platform is expected to expand into functional beverages and reach additional markets by the end of 2022, part of the brand's effort to help consumers avoid plastic bottles. We believe these priorities will position our Company for long-term sustainable growth. See also “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further information about risks and uncertainties that the Company faces. Our Operations See “Item 1. Business” for information on our divisions and a description of our distribution network, ingredients and other supplies, brands and intellectual property rights, seasonality, customers, competition and human capital. In addition, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for financial information about our divisions and geographic areas. Other Relationships Certain members of our Board of Directors also serve on the boards of certain vendors and customers. These Board members do not participate in our vendor selection and negotiations nor in our customer negotiations. Our transactions with these vendors and customers are in the normal course of business and are consistent with terms negotiated with other vendors and customers. In addition, certain of our employees serve on the boards of Pepsi Bottling Ventures LLC and other affiliated companies of PepsiCo and do not receive incremental compensation for such services. Our Business Risks COVID-19 Our global operations continue to expose us to risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, which continues to result in challenging operating environments and has affected almost all of the more than 200 countries and territories in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. Numerous measures have been implemented around the world to try to reduce the spread of the virus, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, curfews, restrictions on public gatherings, shelter in place and safer-at-home orders, business shutdowns and closures. These measures have impacted and will continue to impact us, our customers (including foodservice customers), consumers, employees, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners, suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business, which may continue to result in changes in demand for our products, increases in operating costs (whether as a result of changes to our supply chain or increases in employee costs, including expanded benefits and frontline incentives, costs associated with the provision of personal protective equipment and increased sanitation, or otherwise), or adverse impacts to our supply chain through labor shortages, raw 31 Table of Contents material shortages or reduced availability of air or other commercial transport, port closures or border restrictions, any of which can impact our ability to make, manufacture, distribute and sell our products. In addition, measures that impact our ability to access our offices, plants, warehouses, distribution centers or other facilities, or that impact the ability of our business partners to do the same or the inability of a significant portion of our or our business partners’ workforce to work because of illness, absenteeism, quarantine, vaccine mandates, or travel or other governmental restrictions, may continue to impact the availability or productivity of our and their employees, many of whom are not able to perform their job functions remotely. Public concern regarding the risk of contracting COVID-19 has impacted and may continue to impact demand from consumers, including due to consumers not leaving their homes or leaving their homes less often than they did prior to the start of the pandemic or otherwise shopping for and consuming food and beverage products in a different manner than they historically have or because some of our consumers have lower discretionary income due to unemployment or reduced or limited work as a result of measures taken in response to the pandemic. Even as governmental restrictions are relaxed and economies gradually, partially, or fully reopen in certain of these jurisdictions and markets, the ongoing economic impacts and health concerns associated with the pandemic may continue to affect consumer behavior, spending levels and shopping and consumption preferences. Changes in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns may increase demand for our products in one quarter, resulting in decreased demand for our products in subsequent quarters, or in a lower-margin sales channel resulting in potentially reduced profit from sales of our products. We continue to see shifts in product and channel preferences as markets move through varying stages of restrictions and re-opening at different times, including changes in at-home consumption, in immediate consumption and away-from-home channels, such as convenience and gas and foodservice. In addition, we continue to see an increase in demand in the e-commerce and online-to-offline channels and any failure to capitalize on this demand could adversely affect our ability to maintain and grow sales or category share and erode our competitive position. Any reduced demand for our products or change in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns, as well as continued economic uncertainty (including supply chain disruptions and labor shortages), can adversely affect our customers’ and business partners’ financial condition, which can result in bankruptcy filings and/or an inability to pay for our products, reduced or canceled orders of our products, continued or additional closing of restaurants, stores, entertainment or sports complexes, schools or other venues in which our products are sold, or reduced capacity at any of the foregoing, or our business partners’ inability to supply us with ingredients or other items necessary for us to make, manufacture, distribute or sell our products. Such adverse changes in our customers’ or business partners’ financial condition have also resulted and may continue to result in our recording additional charges for our inability to recover or collect any accounts receivable, owned or leased assets, including certain foodservice and vending and other equipment, or prepaid expenses. In addition, continued economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in volatility in the global capital and credit markets which can impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. While we have developed and implemented and continue to develop and implement health and safety protocols, business continuity plans and crisis management protocols in an effort to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19 to our employees and our business, the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will continue to depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict and which will vary by jurisdiction and market, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, the emergence and spread of new variants of the virus, including the omicron and delta variants, the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, the speed at which vaccines are administered, the efficacy of vaccines against the virus and evolving strains or variants of the virus, global economic conditions during and after the pandemic, governmental actions that have been 32 Table of Contents taken, or may be taken in the future, in response to the pandemic and changes in consumer behavior in response to the pandemic, some of which may be more than just temporary. Risks Associated with Commodities and Our Supply Chain Many of the commodities used in the production and transportation of our products are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and futures. During 2021, we experienced higher than anticipated transportation and commodity costs, which we expect to continue in 2022. A number of external factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, adverse weather conditions, supply chain disruptions (including raw material shortages) and labor shortages, have impacted and may continue to impact transportation and commodity availability and costs. When prices increase, we may or may not pass on such increases to our customers without suffering reduced volume, revenue, margins and operating results. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on how we manage our exposure to commodity prices. Risks Associated with Climate Change Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the potential effects of climate change, including regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and potential carbon pricing programs. These new or increased legal or regulatory requirements could result in significant increased costs of compliance and additional investments in facilities and equipment. However, we are unable to predict the scope, nature and timing of any new or increased environmental laws and regulations and therefore cannot predict the ultimate impact of such laws and regulations on our business or financial results. We continue to monitor existing and proposed laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such laws or regulations. Risks Associated with International Operations We are subject to risks in the normal course of business that are inherent to international operations. During the periods presented in this report, certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, including in certain developing and emerging markets, operated in a challenging environment, experiencing unstable economic, political and social conditions, civil unrest, natural disasters, debt and credit issues and currency controls or fluctuations. We continue to monitor the economic, operating and political environment in these markets closely and to identify actions to potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results. Imposition of Taxes and Regulations on our Products Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes or regulations on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products or their packaging, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or their packaging, commodities used in the production of our products or their packaging or the recyclability or recoverability of our packaging. These taxes and regulations vary in scope and form. For example, some taxes apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). In addition, COVID-19 has resulted in increased regulatory focus on labeling in certain jurisdictions, including in Mexico which enacted product labeling requirements and limitations on the marketing of certain of our products as a result of ingredients or substances contained in such products. Further, some regulations apply to all products using certain types of packaging (e.g., plastic), while others are designed to increase the sustainability of packaging, 33 Table of Contents encourage waste reduction and increased recycling rates or facilitate the waste management process or restrict the sale of products in certain packaging. We sell a wide variety of beverages and convenient foods in more than 200 countries and territories and the profile of the products we sell, the amount of revenue attributable to such products and the type of packaging used vary by jurisdiction. Because of this, we cannot predict the scope or form potential taxes, regulations or other limitations on our products or their packaging may take, and therefore cannot predict the impact of such taxes, regulations or limitations on our financial results. In addition, taxes, regulations and limitations may impact us and our competitors differently. We continue to monitor existing and proposed taxes and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such taxes, regulations or limitations, including advocating alternative measures with respect to the imposition, form and scope of any such taxes, regulations or limitations. Retail Landscape Our industry continues to be affected by disruption of the retail landscape, including the rapid growth in sales through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription services, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers and the international expansion of hard discounters. We have seen and expect to continue to see a further shift to e-commerce, online-to-offline and other online purchasing by consumers, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to monitor changes in the retail landscape and seek to identify actions we may take to build our global e-commerce and digital capabilities, such as expanding our direct-to-consumer business, and distribute our products effectively through all existing and emerging channels of trade and potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results. See also “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Executive Overview” above and “Market Risks” below for more information about these risks and the actions we have taken to address key challenges. Risk Management Framework The achievement of our strategic and operating objectives involves taking risks and that those risks may evolve over time. To identify, assess, prioritize, address, manage, monitor and communicate these risks across the Company’s operations, we leverage an integrated risk management framework. This framework includes the following: • PepsiCo’s Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for PepsiCo’s integrated risk management framework. One of the Board’s primary responsibilities is overseeing and interacting with senior management with respect to key aspects of the Company’s business, including risk assessment and risk mitigation of the Company’s top risks. The Board receives updates on key risks throughout the year, including risks related to food safety and cybersecurity. During 2021, in addition to COVID-19 discussions as part of risk updates to the Board and the relevant Committees, the Board was provided with updates on COVID-19’s impact to our business, financial condition and operations through memos, teleconferences or other appropriate means of communication. In addition, the Board has tasked designated Committees of the Board with oversight of certain categories of risk management, and the Committees report to the Board regularly on these matters. ◦ The Audit Committee of the Board reviews and assesses the guidelines and policies governing PepsiCo’s risk management and oversight processes, and assists the Board’s oversight of financial, compliance and employee safety risks facing PepsiCo; 34 Table of Contents ◦ The Compensation Committee of the Board reviews PepsiCo’s employee compensation policies and practices to assess whether such policies and practices could lead to unnecessary risk-taking behavior; ◦ The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee assists the Board in its oversight of the Company’s governance structure and other corporate governance matters, including succession planning; and ◦ The Sustainability, Diversity and Public Policy Committee of the Board assists the Board in its oversight of PepsiCo’s policies, programs and related risks that concern key sustainability (including climate change), diversity, equity and inclusion, and public policy matters. • The PepsiCo Risk Committee (PRC), which is comprised of a cross-functional, geographically diverse, senior management group, including PepsiCo’s Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, meets regularly to identify, assess, prioritize and address top strategic, financial, operating, compliance, safety, reputational and other risks. The PRC is also responsible for reporting progress on our risk mitigation efforts to the Board; • Division and key market risk committees, comprised of cross-functional senior management teams, meet regularly to identify, assess, prioritize and address division and country-specific business risks; • PepsiCo’s Risk Management Office, which manages the overall risk management process, provides ongoing guidance, tools and analytical support to the PRC and the division and key country risk committees, identifies and assesses potential risks and facilitates ongoing communication between the parties, as well as with PepsiCo’s Board of Directors, the Audit Committee of the Board and other Committees of the Board; • PepsiCo’s Corporate Audit Department evaluates the ongoing effectiveness of our key internal controls through periodic audit and review procedures; and • PepsiCo’s Compliance & Ethics and Law Departments lead and coordinate our compliance policies and practices. Market Risks We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in: • commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy; • foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and • interest rates. In the normal course of business, we manage commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of strategies, including productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs and hedging. Ongoing productivity initiatives involve the identification and effective implementation of meaningful cost-saving opportunities or efficiencies, including the use of derivatives. Our global purchasing programs include fixed-price contracts and purchase orders and pricing agreements. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion of our market risks. The fair value of our derivatives fluctuates based on market rates and prices. The sensitivity of our derivatives to these market fluctuations is discussed below. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these derivatives and our hedging policies. See “Our Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates” for a discussion of the exposure of our pension and retiree medical plan assets and liabilities to risks related to market fluctuations. 35 Table of Contents Inflationary, deflationary and recessionary conditions impacting these market risks also impact the demand for and pricing of our products. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion. Commodity Prices Our commodity derivatives had a total notional value of $1.6 billion as of December 25, 2021 and $1.1 billion as of December 26, 2020. At the end of 2021, the potential change in fair value of commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10% decrease in the underlying commodity price, would have decreased our net unrealized gains in 2021 by $177 million, which would generally be offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases. Foreign Exchange Our operations outside of the United States generated 44% of our consolidated net revenue in 2021, with Mexico, Russia, Canada, China, the United Kingdom and South Africa, collectively, comprising approximately 23% of our consolidated net revenue in 2021. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risks in the international markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. Additionally, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency purchases, foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. During 2021, favorable foreign exchange contributed 1 percentage point to net revenue growth, primarily due to appreciation in the Mexican peso, Canadian dollar and South African rand. Currency declines against the U.S. dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our future financial results. In addition, volatile economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, including in Argentina, Brazil, China, Mexico, the Middle East, Russia and Turkey, and currency controls or fluctuations in certain of these international markets, continue to, and the threat or imposition of new or increased tariffs or sanctions or other impositions in or related to these international markets may, result in challenging operating environments. Our foreign currency derivatives had a total notional value of $2.8 billion as of December 25, 2021 and $1.9 billion as of December 26, 2020. At the end of 2021, we estimate that an unfavorable 10% change in the underlying exchange rates would have decreased our net unrealized gains in 2021 by $278 million, which would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the fair value of the underlying exposure. The total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was $2.1 billion as of December 25, 2021 and $2.7 billion as of December 26, 2020. Interest Rates Our interest rate derivatives had a total notional value of $2.1 billion as of December 25, 2021 and $3.0 billion as of December 26, 2020. Assuming year-end 2021 investment levels and variable rate debt, a 1-percentage-point increase in interest rates would have decreased our net interest expense in 2021 by $47 million due to higher cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments levels, as compared with our variable rate debt. OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS Results of Operations — Consolidated Review Volume Physical or unit volume is one of the key metrics management uses internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan and the evaluation of our business performance. We believe volume provides additional information to facilitate the comparison of our historical operating performance and underlying trends, and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. 36 Table of Contents Beverage volume includes volume of concentrate sold to independent bottlers and volume of finished products bearing company-owned or licensed trademarks and allied brand products and joint venture trademarks sold by company-owned bottling operations. Beverage volume also includes volume of finished products bearing company-owned or licensed trademarks sold by our noncontrolled affiliates. Concentrate volume sold to independent bottlers is reported in concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE), whereas finished beverage product volume is reported in bottler case sales (BCS). Both CSE and BCS convert all beverage volume to an 8-ounce-case metric. Typically, CSE and BCS are not equal in any given period due to seasonality, timing of product launches, product mix, bottler inventory practices and other factors. While our net revenue is not entirely based on BCS volume due to the independent bottlers in our supply chain, we believe that BCS is a better measure of the consumption of our beverage products. PBNA, LatAm, Europe, AMESA and APAC, either independently or in conjunction with third parties, make, market, distribute and sell ready-to-drink tea products through a joint venture with Unilever (under the Lipton brand name), and PBNA, either independently or in conjunction with third parties, makes, markets, distributes and sells ready-to-drink coffee products through a joint venture with Starbucks. In addition, APAC licenses the Tropicana brand for use in China on co-branded juice products in connection with a strategic alliance with Tingyi. Convenient food volume includes volume sold by our subsidiaries and noncontrolled affiliates of convenient food products bearing company-owned or licensed trademarks. Internationally, we measure convenient food product volume in kilograms, while in North America we measure convenient food product volume in pounds. FLNA makes, markets, distributes and sells Sabra refrigerated dips and spreads through a joint venture with Strauss Group. Consolidated Net Revenue and Operating Profit 2021 2020 Change Net revenue $ 79,474 $ 70,372 13 % Operating profit $ 11,162 $ 10,080 11 % Operating margin 14.0 % 14.3 % (0.3) See “Results of Operations – Division Review” for a tabular presentation and discussion of key drivers of net revenue. Operating profit grew 11% and operating margin declined 0.3 percentage points. Operating profit growth was primarily driven by net revenue growth and productivity savings, partially offset by certain operating cost increases, a 14-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, and higher advertising and marketing expenses. The operating margin decline primarily reflects higher commodity costs. Lower charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic compared to the prior year contributed 6 percentage points to operating profit growth. Additionally, lower acquisition and divestiture-related charges included in “Items Affecting Comparability” contributed 3 percentage points to operating profit growth. Juice Transaction In the first quarter of 2022, we sold our Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands to PAI Partners, while retaining a 39% noncontrolling interest in a newly formed joint venture that will operate across North America and Europe. These juice businesses delivered approximately $3 billion in net revenue in 2021. In the U.S., PepsiCo acts as the exclusive distributor for the new joint venture’s portfolio of brands for small-format and foodservice customers with chilled direct-store-delivery. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. 37 Table of Contents Results of Operations — Division Review See “Our Business Risks,” “Non-GAAP Measures” and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a discussion of items to consider when evaluating our results and related information regarding measures not in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). In the discussions of net revenue and operating profit below, “effective net pricing” reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries and “net pricing” reflects the year-over-year combined impact of list price changes, weight changes per package, discounts and allowances. Additionally, “acquisitions and divestitures” reflect mergers and acquisitions activity, as well as divestitures and other structural changes, including changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees. Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth Organic revenue growth is a non-GAAP financial measure.

In certain instances, the impact of organic volume growth on net revenue growth differs from the unit volume growth disclosed in the following divisional discussions due to the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures, product mix, nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our beverage businesses, temporary timing differences between BCS and CSE. Our net revenue excludes nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our franchise-owned beverage businesses, is based on CSE. 38 Table of Contents Operating Profit, Operating Profit Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability and Operating Profit Growth Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability on a Constant Currency Basis Operating profit adjusted for items affecting comparability and operating profit growth adjusted for items affecting comparability on a constant currency basis are both non-GAAP financial measures.

In 2021, this impact is partially offset by divestiture-related charges associated with the Juice Transaction. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. 39 Table of Contents Operating Profit Growth and Operating Profit Growth Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability on a Constant Currency Basis 2021 Impact of Items Affecting Comparability (a) Impact of Reported % Change, GAAP Measure Mark-to-market net impact Restructuring and impairment charges Acquisition and divestiture-related charges Core % Change, Non-GAAP Measure (b) Foreign exchange translation Core Constant Currency % Change, Non-GAAP Measure (b) FLNA 5.5 % — (1) (0.5) 4 % — 3 % QFNA (14) % — (0.5) — (14) % — (14) % PBNA 26 % — (2) (4) 21 % (1) 20 % LatAm 33 % — — — 32 % (4.5) 28 % Europe (4.5) % — 2.5 1 (1.5) % (1.5) (3) % AMESA 43 % — — (31) 12 % (2) 10 % APAC 14 % — 1 (1.5) 14 % (3) 10 % Corporate unallocated expenses 17 % (7) (1) 1 10 % — 10 % Total 11 % 1 — (3) 8 % (1) 7 % (a) See “Items Affecting Comparability” for further information. (b) Amounts may not sum due to rounding. FLNA Net revenue grew 8%, primarily driven by effective net pricing and organic volume growth. Unit volume grew 2%, primarily reflecting double-digit growth in variety packs and the impact of our BFY Brands, Inc. (BFY Brands) acquisition in the first quarter of 2020, partially offset by a low-single-digit decline in trademark Tostitos and a double-digit decline in trademark Santitas. Operating profit increased 5.5%, primarily reflecting the net revenue growth, productivity savings and a 3-percentage-point impact of lower charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, including strategic initiatives and incremental transportation costs, and a 4-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily packaging material and cooking oil. QFNA Net revenue grew slightly and unit volume declined 7%. The net revenue growth reflects effective net pricing and a 1-percentage-point impact of favorable foreign exchange, largely offset by a decrease in organic volume. The unit volume decline was primarily driven by double-digit declines in pancake syrups and mixes and in ready-to-eat cereals and a high-single-digit decline in oatmeal, partially offset by growth in Cheetos macaroni and cheese, which was introduced in the third quarter of 2020, and double-digit growth in lite snacks. Operating profit declined 14%, primarily reflecting certain operating cost increases, including incremental transportation costs, and an 8-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, partially offset by productivity savings. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a current-year decrease in consumer demand, which had a negative impact on net revenue, unit volume and operating profit performance compared to the significant COVID-19 related surge in consumer demand in the prior year. PBNA Net revenue increased 12%, primarily driven by effective net pricing and an increase in organic volume. Unit volume increased 6%, driven by a 7% increase in non-carbonated beverage (NCB) volume and a 4% increase in CSD volume. The NCB volume increase primarily reflected double-digit increases in our 40 Table of Contents overall water portfolio and our energy portfolio, a low-single-digit increase in Gatorade sports drinks and a mid-single-digit increase in Lipton ready-to-drink teas. Operating profit increased 26%, primarily reflecting the net revenue growth, a 15-percentage-point impact of lower charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and productivity savings. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, including incremental transportation costs, an 18-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs and higher advertising and marketing expenses. Higher prior-year acquisition and divestiture-related charges contributed 4 percentage points to operating profit growth. Changes in consumer behavior as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a current-year increase in consumer demand, which had a positive impact on net revenue, unit volume and operating profit performance. In 2020, we received a notice of termination without cause from Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which would end our distribution rights of Bang Energy drinks, effective October 24, 2023. LatAm Net revenue increased 17%, primarily reflecting effective net pricing and organic volume growth. Convenient foods unit volume grew 3.5%, primarily reflecting low-single-digit growth in Brazil and Mexico. Beverage unit volume grew 8%, primarily reflecting double-digit growth in Argentina and Chile. Additionally, Brazil experienced low-single-digit growth, Mexico experienced mid-single-digit growth and Guatemala experienced high-single-digit growth. Operating profit increased 33%, primarily reflecting the net revenue growth, productivity savings and a 4.5-percentage-point impact of favorable foreign exchange. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, a 30-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs and higher advertising and marketing expenses. A current-year recognition of certain indirect tax credits in Brazil and lower charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic contributed 6 percentage points and 4 percentage points, respectively, to operating profit growth. Changes in consumer behavior as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a current-year increase in consumer demand, which had a positive impact on net revenue, unit volume and operating profit performance. Europe Net revenue increased 9%, primarily reflecting organic volume growth and effective net pricing. Convenient foods unit volume grew 4%, primarily reflecting double-digit growth in Turkey and mid-single-digit growth in Russia and Poland, partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in the United Kingdom. Additionally, the Netherlands grew slightly and France experienced low-single-digit growth. Beverage unit volume grew 8%, primarily reflecting double-digit growth in Russia, Turkey and the United Kingdom and high-single-digit growth in France, partially offset by a low-single-digit decline in Germany. Operating profit decreased 4.5%, primarily reflecting certain operating cost increases, a 28-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs and a 2.5-percentage-point impact each from higher restructuring and impairment charges and a gain on an asset sale in the prior year. These impacts were partially offset by the net revenue growth and productivity savings. Additionally, lower charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and favorable settlements of promotional spending accruals compared to the prior 41 Table of Contents year positively contributed 5 percentage points and 3 percentage points, respectively, to operating profit performance. Changes in consumer behavior as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a current-year increase in consumer demand, which had a positive impact on net revenue and unit volume performance. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the implementation of an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system in the United Kingdom caused a temporary disruption to our United Kingdom operations which had a negative impact on net revenue, unit volume and operating profit performance. These issues were largely resolved within the quarter and the business operations had resumed by year end. AMESA Net revenue increased 33%, reflecting a 14-percentage-point impact of our Pioneer Foods acquisition, which included the impact of an extra month of net revenue compared to the prior year as we aligned Pioneer Foods’ reporting calendar with that of our AMESA division, as well as organic volume growth and effective net pricing. Favorable foreign exchange contributed 4.5 percentage points to net revenue growth. Convenient foods unit volume grew 38%, primarily reflecting a 35-percentage-point impact of our Pioneer Foods acquisition, which included the impact of an extra month of unit volume as we aligned Pioneer Foods’ reporting calendar with that of our AMESA division, double-digit growth in India and Pakistan and high-single-digit growth in the Middle East, partially offset by a low-single-digit decline in South Africa (excluding our Pioneer Foods acquisition). Beverage unit volume grew 20%, primarily reflecting double-digit growth in India and Pakistan. Additionally, the Middle East experienced double-digit growth and Nigeria experienced high-single-digit growth. Operating profit increased 43%, primarily reflecting the net revenue growth, a 31-percentage-point impact of the prior-year acquisition and divestiture-related charges associated with our Pioneer Foods acquisition and productivity savings. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, a 13-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs and higher advertising and marketing expenses. Additionally, lower charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and our Pioneer Foods acquisition contributed 3 percentage points and 2 percentage points, respectively, to operating profit growth. Changes in consumer behavior as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a current-year increase in consumer demand, which had a positive impact on net revenue, unit volume and operating profit performance. APAC Net revenue increased 34%, reflecting a 15-percentage-point impact of our Be & Cheery acquisition, which included the impact of an extra month of net revenue compared to the prior year as we aligned Be & Cheery’s reporting calendar with that of our APAC division, as well as organic volume growth, a 6- percentage-point impact of favorable foreign exchange and effective net pricing. Convenient foods unit volume grew 19%, primarily reflecting a 16-percentage-point impact of our Be & Cheery acquisition, which included the impact of an extra month of unit volume as we aligned Be & Cheery’s reporting calendar with that of our APAC division, and double-digit growth in China (excluding our Be & Cheery acquisition) and Thailand. Additionally, Australia, Indonesia and Taiwan each experienced low-single-digit growth. 42 Table of Contents Beverage unit volume grew 13%, primarily reflecting double-digit growth in China, partially offset by a low-single-digit decline in Vietnam. Additionally, the Philippines experienced low-single-digit growth and Thailand experienced mid-single-digit growth. Operating profit increased 14%, primarily reflecting the net revenue growth, productivity savings and a 2- percentage-point contribution from our Be & Cheery acquisition, partially offset by certain operating cost increases and higher advertising and marketing expenses. Additionally, impairment charges associated with an equity method investment reduced operating profit growth by 3 percentage points. Favorable foreign exchange contributed 3 percentage points to operating profit growth. Other Consolidated Results 2021 2020 Change Other pension and retiree medical benefits income $ 522 $ 117 $ 405 Net interest expense and other $ (1,863) $ (1,128) $ (735) Annual tax rate 21.8 % 20.9 % Net income attributable to PepsiCo (a) $ 7,618 $ 7,120 7 % Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted (a) $ 5.49 $ 5.12 7 % (a) In 2021, lower charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic contributed 7 percentage points to both net income attributable to PepsiCo growth and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share growth. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Other pension and retiree medical benefits income increased $405 million, primarily reflecting lower settlement charges in 2021, the recognition of fixed income gains on plan assets, the impact of plan changes approved in 2020, as discussed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, and the impact of discretionary plan contributions, partially offset by a decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets. Net interest expense and other increased $735 million, reflecting a charge of $842 million in connection with our cash tender offers. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. This impact was partially offset by lower interest rates on average debt balances. The reported tax rate increased 0.9 percentage points, primarily reflecting the net tax impact of adjustments to uncertain tax positions related to the final assessment from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audit for the tax years 2014 through 2016. Non-GAAP Measures Certain financial measures contained in this Form 10-K adjust for the impact of specified items and are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures in this Form 10-K allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends. We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring plans; costs associated with mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes; gains associated with divestitures; pension and retiree medical-related amounts (including all settlement and curtailment gains and losses); charges or 43 Table of Contents adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; asset impairments (non-cash); and remeasurements of net monetary assets. Previously, certain immaterial pension and retiree medical-related settlement and curtailment gains and losses were not considered items affecting comparability. Pension and retiree medical-related service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, and other net periodic pension costs will continue to be reflected in our core results. See below and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a description of adjustments to our U.S. GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K. Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. The following non-GAAP financial measures contained in this Form 10-K are discussed below: Cost of sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, other pension and retiree medical benefits income, net interest expense and other, provision for income taxes, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and net income attributable to PepsiCo, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, operating profit and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, and the corresponding constant currency growth rates These measures exclude the net impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on centrally managed commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, restructuring and impairment charges related to our 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan (2019 Productivity Plan), costs associated with our acquisitions and divestitures, the impact of settlement and curtailment gains and losses related to pension and retiree medical plans, a charge related to cash tender offers and tax expense related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJ Act) (see “Items Affecting Comparability” for a detailed description of each of these items). We also evaluate performance on operating profit and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, on a constant currency basis, which measure our financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. We believe these measures provide useful information in evaluating the results of our business because they exclude items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year. Organic revenue growth We define organic revenue growth as a measure that adjusts for the impacts of foreign exchange translation, acquisitions and divestitures, and where applicable, the impact of an additional week of results every five or six years (53 rd reporting week), including in our 2022 financial results. Adjusting for acquisitions and divestitures reflects mergers and acquisitions activity, including the impact in 2021 of an extra month of net revenue for our acquisitions of Pioneer Foods in our AMESA division and Be & Cheery in our APAC division as we aligned the reporting calendars of these acquisitions with those of our divisions, as well as divestitures and other structural changes, including changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees. We believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year. See “Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth” in “Results of Operations – Division Review” for further information. 44 Table of Contents Free cash flow We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital spending, plus sales of property, plant and equipment. Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities. Free cash flow is used by us primarily for acquisitions and financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure. See “Free Cash Flow” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information. Return on invested capital (ROIC) and net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability We define ROIC as net income attributable to PepsiCo plus interest expense after-tax divided by the sum of quarterly average debt obligations and quarterly average common shareholders’ equity. Although ROIC is a common financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating ROIC. Accordingly, the method used by management to calculate ROIC may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their ROIC. We believe this metric serves as a measure of how well we use our capital to generate returns. In addition, we use net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability, to compare our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis because it removes from our operating results the impact of items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance and reflects how management evaluates our operating results and trends. We define net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability, as ROIC, adjusted for quarterly average cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, after-tax interest income and items affecting comparability. We believe the calculation of ROIC and net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability, provides useful information to investors and is an additional relevant comparison of our performance to consider when evaluating our capital allocation efficiency. See “Return on Invested Capital” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information. 45 Table of Contents Items Affecting Comparability Our reported financial results in this Form 10-K are impacted by the following items in each of the following years: 2021 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Net interest expense and other Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 37,075 $ 42,399 $ 31,237 $ 11,162 $ 522 $ (1,863) $ 2,142 $ 61 $ 7,618 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact (39) 39 20 19 — — 5 — 14 Restructuring and impairment charges (29) 29 (208) 237 10 — 41 1 205 Acquisition and divestiture-related charges (1) 1 5 (4) — — 23 — (27) Pension and retiree medical-related impact — — — — 12 — 1 — 11 Charge related to cash tender offers — — — — — 842 165 — 677 Tax expense related to the TCJ Act — — — — — — (190) — 190 Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 37,006 $ 42,468 $ 31,054 $ 11,414 $ 544 $ (1,021) $ 2,187 $ 62 $ 8,688 2020 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 31,797 $ 38,575 $ 28,495 $ 10,080 $ 117 $ 1,894 $ 7,120 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact 64 (64) 9 (73) — (15) (58) Restructuring and impairment charges (30) 30 (239) 269 20 58 231 Acquisition and divestiture-related charges (32) 32 (223) 255 — 18 237 Pension and retiree medical-related impact — — — — 205 47 158 Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 31,799 $ 38,573 $ 28,042 $ 10,531 $ 342 $ 2,002 $ 7,688 (a) Provision for income taxes is the expected tax charge/benefit on the underlying item based on the tax laws and income tax rates applicable to the underlying item in its corresponding tax jurisdiction. 2021 2020 Change Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, GAAP measure $ 5.49 $ 5.12 7 % Mark-to-market net impact 0.01 (0.04) Restructuring and impairment charges 0.15 0.17 Acquisition and divestiture-related charges (0.02) 0.17 Pension and retiree medical-related impact 0.01 0.11 Charge related to cash tender offers 0.49 — Tax expense related to the TCJ Act 0.14 — Core net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, non-GAAP measure $ 6.26 (a) $ 5.52 (a) 13 % Impact of foreign exchange translation (1.5) Growth in core net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP measure 12 % (a) (a) Does not sum due to rounding. 46 Table of Contents Mark-to-Market Net Impact We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include agricultural products, energy and metals. Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in corporate unallocated expenses. Restructuring and Impairment Charges 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan The 2019 Productivity Plan, publicly announced on February 15, 2019, will leverage new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. To build on the successful implementation of the 2019 Productivity Plan to date, we expanded and extended the program through the end of 2026 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives of the 2019 Productivity Plan. We now expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $3.15 billion, including cash expenditures of approximately $2.4 billion, as compared to our previous estimate of pre-tax charges of approximately $2.5 billion, which included cash expenditures of approximately $1.6 billion. Plan to date through December 25, 2021, we have incurred pre-tax charges of $1.0 billion, including cash expenditures of $776 million. In our 2022 financial results, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $350 million, including cash expenditures of approximately $300 million. These charges will be funded primarily through cash from operations. We expect to incur the majority of the remaining pre-tax charges and cash expenditures in our 2022 and 2023 financial results, with the balance to be incurred through 2026. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further information related to our 2019 Productivity Plan. We regularly evaluate productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plan and other initiatives discussed above and in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. Acquisition and Divestiture-Related Charges Acquisition and divestiture-related charges primarily include fair value adjustments to the acquired inventory included in the acquisition-date balance sheets, merger and integration charges and costs associated with divestitures. Merger and integration charges include liabilities to support socioeconomic programs in South Africa, closing costs, employee-related costs, gains associated with contingent consideration, contract termination costs and other integration costs. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Pension and Retiree Medical-Related Impact Pension and retiree medical-related impact primarily includes settlement charges related to lump sum distributions exceeding the total of annual service and interest costs, as well as curtailment gains related to plan changes. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. 47 Table of Contents Charge Related to Cash Tender Offers As a result of the cash tender offers for some of our long-term debt, we recorded a charge primarily representing the tender price paid over the carrying value of the tendered notes and loss on treasury rate locks used to mitigate the interest rate risk on the cash tender offers. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Tax Expense Related to the TCJ Act Tax expense related to the TCJ Act reflects adjustments to the mandatory transition tax liability under the TCJ Act. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. 48 Table of Contents Our Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our cash generating capability and financial condition, together with our revolving credit facilities, working capital lines and other available methods of debt financing, such as commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs, including with respect to our net capital spending plans. Our primary sources of liquidity include cash from operations, pre-tax cash proceeds of approximately $3.5 billion from the Juice Transaction, proceeds obtained from issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt, and cash and cash equivalents. These sources of cash are available to fund cash outflows that have both a short- and long-term component, including debt repayments and related interest payments; payments for acquisitions, including support for socioeconomic programs in South Africa related to our acquisition of Pioneer Foods; operating leases; purchase, marketing, and other contractual commitments, including capital expenditures and the transition tax liability under the TCJ Act. In addition, these sources of cash fund other cash outflows including anticipated dividend payments and share repurchases. We do not have guarantees or off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, that we believe could have a material impact on our liquidity. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Our Business Risks” and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Our sources and uses of cash were not materially adversely impacted by COVID-19 and, to date, we have not identified any material liquidity deficiencies as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the information currently available to us, we do not expect the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic to have a material impact on our future liquidity. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact the COVID-19 pandemic may have on our business and financial results. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Our Business Risks” and Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further information related to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial results. As of December 25, 2021, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in our consolidated subsidiaries subject to currency controls or currency exchange restrictions were not material. The TCJ Act imposed a one-time mandatory transition tax on undistributed international earnings, including $18.9 billion held in our consolidated subsidiaries outside the United States as of December 30, 2017. As of December 25, 2021, our mandatory transition tax liability was $2.9 billion, which must be paid through 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act; we currently expect to pay approximately $309 million of this liability in 2022. Any additional guidance issued by the IRS may impact our recorded amounts for this transition tax liability. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the TCJ Act. As part of our evolving market practices, we work with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions, which include the extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with a majority of our suppliers generally range from 60 to 90 days, which we deem to be commercially reasonable. We will continue to monitor economic conditions and market practice working with our suppliers to adjust as necessary. We also maintain voluntary supply chain finance agreements with several participating global financial institutions. Under these agreements, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, may elect to sell their accounts receivable with PepsiCo to these participating global financial institutions. Supplier participation in these financing arrangements is voluntary. Our suppliers negotiate their financing agreements directly with the respective global financial institutions and we are not a party to these agreements. These financing arrangements allow participating suppliers to leverage PepsiCo’s creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs, which generally provides our suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own. Neither PepsiCo nor any of its subsidiaries provide any guarantees to any third party in connection with these financing arrangements. We have no economic interest in our suppliers’ decision to participate in these agreements. Our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not impacted. All 49 Table of Contents outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in such financing arrangements are recorded within accounts payable and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. We were informed by the participating financial institutions that as of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, of our accounts payable to suppliers who participate in these financing arrangements are outstanding. These supply chain finance arrangements did not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources in the periods presented and we do not expect such arrangements to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality. Working capital needs are impacted by weekly sales, which are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns and generally lowest in the first quarter. On a continuing basis, we consider various transactions to increase shareholder value and enhance our business results, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, dividends, share repurchases, productivity and other efficiency initiatives and other structural changes. These transactions may result in future cash proceeds or payments. The table below summarizes our cash activity: 2021 2020 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 11,616 $ 10,613 Net cash used for investing activities $ (3,269) $ (11,619) Net cash (used for)/provided by financing activities $ (10,780) $ 3,819 Operating Activities In 2021, net cash provided by operating activities was $11.6 billion, compared to $10.6 billion in the prior year. The increase in operating cash flow primarily reflects favorable working capital comparisons and operating profit performance, partially offset by higher pre-tax pension and retiree medical plan contributions and higher net cash tax payments in the current year. Investing Activities In 2021, net cash used for investing activities was $3.3 billion, primarily reflecting net capital spending of $4.5 billion, partially offset by maturities of short-term investments with maturities greater than three months of $1.1 billion. In 2020, net cash used for investing activities was $11.6 billion, primarily reflecting net cash paid in connection with our acquisitions of Rockstar of $3.85 billion, Pioneer Foods of $1.2 billion and Be & Cheery of $0.7 billion, net capital spending of $4.2 billion, as well as purchases of short-term investments with maturities greater than three months of $1.1 billion. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of capital spending by division; see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our investments in debt securities; and see Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our acquisitions. We regularly review our plans with respect to net capital spending, including in light of the ongoing uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, and believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our net capital spending needs. Financing Activities In 2021, net cash used for financing activities was $10.8 billion, primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders largely through dividend payments of $5.8 billion, cash tender offers/debt redemption of $4.8 billion, payments of long-term debt borrowings of $3.5 billion and 50 Table of Contents payments of acquisition-related contingent consideration of $0.8 billion, partially offset by proceeds from issuances of long-term debt of $4.1 billion. In 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $3.8 billion, primarily reflecting proceeds from issuances of long-term debt of $13.8 billion, partially offset by the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases of $7.5 billion, payments of long-term debt borrowings of $1.8 billion and debt redemptions of $1.1 billion. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of debt obligations. We annually review our capital structure with our Board of Directors, including our dividend policy and share repurchase activity. On February 13, 2018, we announced the 2018 share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $15.0 billion of PepsiCo common stock which commenced on July 1, 2018 and expired on June 30, 2021. On February 10, 2022, we announced the 2022 share repurchase program. See “Item 5. Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” for further information. In addition, on February 10, 2022, we announced a 7% increase in our annualized dividend to $4.60 per share from $4.30 per share, effective with the dividend expected to be paid in June 2022. We expect to return a total of approximately $7.7 billion to shareholders in 2022, comprising dividends of approximately $6.2 billion and share repurchases of approximately $1.5 billion. Free Cash Flow The table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities, as reflected on our cash flow statement, to our free cash flow. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on free cash flow, see “Non-GAAP Measures.” 2021 2020 Change Net cash provided by operating activities, GAAP measure $ 11,616 $ 10,613 9 % Capital spending (4,625) (4,240) Sales of property, plant and equipment 166 55 Free cash flow, non-GAAP measure $ 7,157 $ 6,428 11 % We use free cash flow primarily for acquisitions and financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. We expect to continue to return free cash flow to our shareholders primarily through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global capital and credit markets at favorable interest rates. However, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Our Business Risks” for certain factors that may impact our credit ratings or our operating cash flows. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, whether or not as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Our Business Risks” and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Material Changes in Line Items in Our Consolidated Financial Statements Material changes in line items in our consolidated statement of income are discussed in “Results of Operations – Division Review” and “Items Affecting Comparability.” 51 Table of Contents Material changes in line items in our consolidated statement of cash flows are discussed in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources.” Material changes in line items in our consolidated balance sheet are discussed below: Total Assets In 2021, total assets were $92.4 billion, compared to $92.9 billion in the prior year.

These policies may require management to make difficult and subjective judgments regarding uncertainties, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and as a result, such estimates may significantly impact our financial results. The precision of these estimates and the likelihood of future changes depend on a number of underlying variables and a range of possible outcomes. We applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all material respects and for all periods presented. We have discussed our critical accounting policies and estimates with our Audit Committee. Our critical accounting policies and estimates are: • revenue recognition; • goodwill and other intangible assets; • income tax expense and accruals; and • pension and retiree medical plans. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when our performance obligation is satisfied. Our primary performance obligation (the distribution and sales of beverage and convenient food products) is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to our customers, which is also when control is transferred. The transfer of control of products to our customers is typically based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return. However, our policy for DSD, including certain chilled products, is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect. Similarly, our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. As a result, we record reserves, based on estimates, for anticipated damaged and out-of-date produc ts. Our products are sold for cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry practices, typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the United States, and generally within 30 to 90 days internationally, and may allow discounts for early payment. We estimate and reserve for our expected credit loss exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility, write-off history, the aging of accounts receivable, our analysis of customer data, and forward-looking information (including the expected impact of the global economic uncertainty 53 Table of Contents related to the COVID-19 pandemic), leveraging estimates of creditworthiness and projections of default and recovery rates for certain of our customers. Our policy is to provide customers with product when needed. In fact, our commitment to freshness and product dating serves to regulate the quantity of product shipped or delivered. In addition, DSD products are placed on the shelf by our employees with customer shelf space and storerooms limiting the quantity of product. For product delivered through other distribution networks, we monitor customer inventory levels. As discussed in “Our Customers” in “Item 1. Business,” we offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to customers for performing activities on our behalf, such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new products, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices. Sales incentives and discounts also include support provided to our independent bottlers through funding of advertising and other marketing activities. A number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur after year end once reconciled and settled. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our revenue recognition and related policies, including total marketplace spending. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We sell products under a number of brand names, many of which were developed by us. Brand development costs are expensed as incurred. We also purchase brands and other intangible assets in acquisitions. In a business combination, the consideration is first assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities, including brands and other intangible assets, based on estimated fair values, with any excess recorded as goodwill. Determining fair value requires significant estimates and assumptions, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic, based on an evaluation of a number of factors, such as marketplace participants, product life cycles, market share, consumer awareness, brand history and future expansion expectations, amount and timing of future cash flows and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. We believe that a brand has an indefinite life if it has a history of strong revenue and cash flow performance and we have the intent and ability to support the brand with marketplace spending for the foreseeable future. If these indefinite-lived brand criteria are not met, brands are amortized over their expected useful lives, which generally range from 20 to 40 years. Determining the expected life of a brand requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors, including market share, consumer awareness, brand history, future expansion expectations and regulatory restrictions, as well as the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brand is sold. In connection with previous acquisitions, we reacquired certain franchise rights which provided the exclusive and perpetual rights to manufacture and/or distribute beverages for sale in specified territories. In determining the useful life of these franchise rights, many factors were considered, including the pre- 54 Table of Contents existing perpetual bottling arrangements, the indefinite period expected for these franchise rights to contribute to our future cash flows, as well as the lack of any factors that would limit the useful life of these franchise rights to us, including legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors. Therefore, certain of these franchise rights are considered as indefinite-lived. Franchise rights that are not considered indefinite-lived are amortized over the remaining contractual period of the contract in which the right was granted. Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and, as a result, are assessed for impairment at least annually, using either a qualitative or quantitative approach. We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Where we use the qualitative assessment, first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered include macroeconomic (including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic), industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environment, historical financial performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed. In the quantitative assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, an assessment is performed to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and the reporting unit, respectively. Estimated fair value is determined using discounted cash flows and requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with management’s strategic business plans, annual sales growth rates, perpetuity growth assumptions and the selection of assumptions underlying a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. Significant management judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeconomic and other factors (including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic) to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, such as forecasted growth rates (including perpetuity growth assumptions) and weighted-average cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. A deterioration in these assumptions could adversely impact our results. These assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain of the risks described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Our Business Risks.” Amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows. See Note 2 and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Income Tax Expense and Accruals Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax structure and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we likely will not succeed. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit, new tax laws, relevant court cases or tax authority settlements. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion. An estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to our quarterly operating results. In the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is 55 Table of Contents separately calculated and recorded at the same time as that item. We consider the tax adjustments from the resolution of prior-year tax matters to be among such items. Tax law requires items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our consolidated financial statements. As a result, our annual tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different than that reported in our tax returns (our cash tax rate). Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit on our consolidated financial statements. We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is not more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our consolidated financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but have not yet recognized as expense in our consolidated financial statements. In 2021, our annual tax rate was 21.8% compared to 20.9% in 2020. See “Other Consolidated Results” for further information. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Pension and Retiree Medical Plans Our pension plans cover certain employees in the United States and certain international employees. Benefits are determined based on either years of service or a combination of years of service and earnings. Certain U.S. and Canada retirees are also eligible for medical and life insurance benefits (retiree medical) if they meet age and service requirements. Generally, our share of retiree medical costs is capped at specified dollar amounts, which vary based upon years of service, with retirees contributing the remainder of the cost. In addition, we have been phasing out certain subsidies of retiree medical benefits. See “Items Affecting Comparability” and Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for information about changes and settlements within our pension plans. Our Assumptions The determination of pension and retiree medical expenses and obligations requires the use of assumptions to estimate the amount of benefits that employees earn while working, as well as the present value of those benefits. Annual pension and retiree medical expense amounts are principally based on four components: (1) the value of benefits earned by employees for working during the year (service cost), (2) the increase in the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time (interest cost), and (3) other gains and losses as discussed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, reduced by (4) the expected return on assets for our funded plans. Significant assumptions used to measure our annual pension and retiree medical expenses include: • certain employee-related demographic factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; • the expected rate of return on assets in our funded plans; • the spot rates along the yield curve used to determine service and interest costs and the present value of liabilities; • for pension expense, the rate of salary increases for plans where benefits are based on earnings; and • for retiree medical expense, health care cost trend rates. 56 Table of Contents Certain assumptions reflect our historical experience and management’s best judgment regarding future expectations. All actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually, except in the case of an interim remeasurement due to a significant event such as a curtailment or settlement. Due to the significant management judgment involved, these assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension and retiree medical expenses and obligations. At each measurement date, the discount rates are based on interest rates for high-quality, long-term corporate debt securities with maturities comparable to those of our liabilities. Our U.S. obligation and pension and retiree medical expense is based on the discount rates determined using the Mercer Above Mean Curve. This curve includes bonds that closely match the timing and amount of our expected benefit payments and reflects the portfolio of investments we would consider to settle our liabilities. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for information about the expected rate of return on plan assets and our plans’ investment strategy. Although we review our expected long-term rates of return on an annual basis, our asset returns in a given year do not significantly influence our evaluation of long-term rates of return. The health care trend rate used to determine our retiree medical plans’ obligation and expense is reviewed annually. Our review is based on our claims experience, information provided by our health plans and actuaries, and our knowledge of the health care industry. Our review of the trend rate considers factors such as demographics, plan design, new medical technologies and changes in medical carriers. Weighted-average assumptions for pension and retiree medical expense are as follows: 2022 2021 2020 Pension Service cost discount rate 3.1 % 2.6 % 3.4 % Interest cost discount rate 2.4 % 1.9 % 2.8 % Expected rate of return on plan assets 6.1 % 6.2 % 6.6 % Expected rate of salary increases 3.1 % 3.1 % 3.2 % Retiree medical Service cost discount rate 2.8 % 2.3 % 3.2 % Interest cost discount rate 2.1 % 1.6 % 2.6 % Expected rate of return on plan assets 5.7 % 5.4 % 5.8 % Current health care cost trend rate 5.8 % 5.5 % 5.6 % Based on our assumptions, we expect our total pension and retiree medical expense to decrease in 2022 primarily reflecting plan changes and related impacts, and higher discount rates. Sensitivity of Assumptions A decrease in each of the collective discount rates or in the expected rate of return assumptions would increase expense for our benefit plans. A 25-basis-point decrease in each of the above discount rates and expected rate of return assumptions would individually increase 2022 pre-tax pension and retiree medical expense as follows: Assumption Amount Discount rates used in the calculation of expense $ 37 Expected rate of return $ 49 57 Table of Contents Funding We make contributions to pension trusts that provide plan benefits for certain pension plans. These contributions are made in accordance with applicable tax regulations that provide for current tax deductions for our contributions and taxation to the employee only upon receipt of plan benefits. Generally, we do not fund our pension plans when our contributions would not be currently tax deductible. As our retiree medical plans are not subject to regulatory funding requirements, we generally fund these plans on a pay-as-you-go basis, although we periodically review available options to make additional contributions toward these benefits. We made discretionary contributions to our U.S. qualified defined benefit plans of $75 million in January 2022 and expect to make an additional $75 million contribution in the third quarter of 2022. Our pension and retiree medical plan contributions are subject to change as a result of many factors, such as changes in interest rates, deviations between actual and expected asset returns and changes in tax or other benefit laws. We continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related global economic conditions and uncertainty on the net unfunded status of our pension and retiree medical plans. We regularly evaluate different opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for our past and expected contributions and estimated future benefit payments. 58 Table of Contents Consolidated Statement of Income PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries Fiscal years ended December 25, 2021, December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 (in millions except per share amounts) 2021 2020 2019 Net Revenue $ 79,474 $ 70,372 $ 67,161 Cost of sales 37,075 31,797 30,132 Gross profit 42,399 38,575 37,029 Selling, general and administrative expenses 31,237 28,495 26,738 Operating Profit 11,162 10,080 10,291 Other pension and retiree medical benefits income/(expense) 522 117 ( 44 ) Net interest expense and other ( 1,863 ) ( 1,128 ) ( 935 ) Income before income taxes 9,821 9,069 9,312 Provision for income taxes 2,142 1,894 1,959 Net income 7,679 7,175 7,353 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 61 55 39 Net Income Attributable to PepsiCo $ 7,618 $ 7,120 $ 7,314 Net Income Attributable to PepsiCo per Common Share Basic $ 5.51 $ 5.14 $ 5.23 Diluted $ 5.49 $ 5.12 $ 5.20 Weighted-average common shares outstanding Basic 1,382 1,385 1,399 Diluted 1,389 1,392 1,407 See accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. 59 Table of Contents Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries Fiscal years ended December 25, 2021, December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 (in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Net income $ 7,679 $ 7,175 $ 7,353 Other comprehensive income/(loss), net of taxes: Net currency translation adjustment ( 369 ) ( 650 ) 628 Net change on cash flow hedges 155 7 ( 90 ) Net pension and retiree medical adjustments 770 ( 532 ) 283 Other 22 ( 1 ) ( 2 ) 578 ( 1,176 ) 819 Comprehensive income 8,257 5,999 8,172 Less: Comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests 61 55 39 Comprehensive Income Attributable to PepsiCo $ 8,196 $ 5,944 $ 8,133 See accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. 60 Table of Contents Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries Fiscal years ended December 25, 2021, December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 (in millions) 2021 2020 2019 Operating Activities Net income $ 7,679 $ 7,175 $ 7,353 Depreciation and amortization 2,710 2,548 2,432 Operating lease right-of-use asset amortization 505 478 412 Share-based compensation expense 301 264 237 Restructuring and impairment charges 247 289 370 Cash payments for restructuring charges ( 256 ) ( 255 ) ( 350 ) Acquisition and divestiture-related charges ( 4 ) 255 55 Cash payments for acquisition and divestiture-related charges ( 176 ) ( 131 ) ( 10 ) Pension and retiree medical plan expenses 123 408 519 Pension and retiree medical plan contributions ( 785 ) ( 562 ) ( 716 ) Deferred income taxes and other tax charges and credits 298 361 453 Tax expense/(benefit) related to the TCJ Act 190 — ( 8 ) Tax payments related to the TCJ Act ( 309 ) ( 78 ) ( 423 ) Change in assets and liabilities: Accounts and notes receivable ( 651 ) ( 420 ) ( 650 ) Inventories ( 582 ) ( 516 ) ( 190 ) Prepaid expenses and other current assets 159 26 ( 87 ) Accounts payable and other current liabilities 1,762 766 735 Income taxes payable 30 ( 159 ) ( 287 ) Other, net 375 164 ( 196 ) Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 11,616 10,613 9,649 Investing Activities Capital spending ( 4,625 ) ( 4,240 ) ( 4,232 ) Sales of property, plant and equipment 166 55 170 Acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and investments in noncontrolled affiliates ( 61 ) ( 6,372 ) ( 2,717 ) Divestitures and sales of investments in noncontrolled affiliates 169 6 253 Short-term investments, by original maturity: More than three months -

See accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. 64 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 — Basis of Presentation and Our Divisions Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include the consolidated accounts of PepsiCo, Inc. and the affiliates that we control. In addition, we include our share of the results of certain other affiliates using the equity method based on our economic ownership interest, our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating or financial decisions of these affiliates or our ability to direct their economic resources. We do not control these other affiliates, as our ownership in these other affiliates is generally 50 % or less. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. As a result of exchange restrictions and other operating restrictions, we do not have control over our Venezuelan subsidiaries. As such, our Venezuelan subsidiaries are not included within our consolidated financial results for any period presented. Raw materials, direct labor and plant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, costs directly related to production planning, inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities, are included in cost of sales. The costs of moving, storing and delivering finished product, including merchandising activities, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are used in determining, among other items, sales incentives accruals, tax reserves, share-based compensation, pension and retiree medical accruals, amounts and useful lives for intangible assets and future cash flows associated with impairment testing for indefinite-lived intangible assets, goodwill and other long-lived assets. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience, as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances, such as current economic conditions, and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change. Additionally, the business and economic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has made such estimates and assumptions more difficult to calculate. As future events and their effect cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of each December, resulting in a 53 rd reporting week every five or six years, including in our 2022 financial results. While our North America results are reported on a weekly calendar basis, substantially all of our international operations reported on a monthly calendar basis prior to the fourth quarter of 2021, and beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021, all of our international operations report on a monthly calendar basis. This change did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The following chart details our quarterly reporting schedule for the three years presented: Quarter United States and Canada International First Quarter 12 weeks January, February Second Quarter 12 weeks March, April and May Third Quarter 12 weeks June, July and August Fourth Quarter 16 weeks September, October, November and December Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Certain reclassifications were made to the prior year’s consolidated financial statements to conform to the current year presentation. 65 Table of Contents Our Divisions We are organized into seven reportable segments (also referred to as divisions), as follows: 1) FLNA, which includes our branded convenient food businesses in the United States and Canada; 2) QFNA, which includes our branded convenient food businesses, such as cereal, rice, pasta and other branded food, in the United States and Canada; 3) PBNA, which includes our beverage businesses in the United States and Canada; 4) LatAm, which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Latin America; 5) Europe, which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Europe; 6) AMESA, which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia; and 7) APAC, which includes all of our beverage and convenient food businesses in Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand, and China region. Through our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a wide variety of beverages and convenient foods, serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories with our largest operations in the United States, Mexico, Russia, Canada, China, the United Kingdom and South Africa. The accounting policies for the divisions are the same as those described in Note 2, except for the following allocation methodologies: • share-based compensation expense; • pension and retiree medical expense; and • derivatives. Share-Based Compensation Expense Our divisions are held accountable for share-based compensation expense and, therefore, this expense is allocated to our divisions as an incremental employee compensation cost. The allocation of share-based compensation expense of each division is as follows: 2021 2020 2019 FLNA 13 % 13 % 13 % QFNA 1 % 1 % 1 % PBNA 19 % 18 % 17 % LatAm 5 % 6 % 7 % Europe 13 % 16 % 17 % AMESA 6 % 6 % 3 % APAC 2 % 2 % 5 % Corporate unallocated expenses 41 % 38 % 37 % The expense allocated to our divisions excludes any impact of changes in our assumptions during the year which reflect market conditions over which division management has no control. Therefore, any variances between allocated expense and our actual expense are recognized in corporate unallocated expenses. Pension and Retiree Medical Expense Pension and retiree medical service costs measured at fixed discount rates are reflected in division results. The variance between the fixed discount rate used to determine the service cost reflected in division results and the discount rate as disclosed in Note 7 is reflected in corporate unallocated expenses. 66 Table of Contents Derivatives We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include agricultural products, energy and metals. Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in corporate unallocated expenses. These derivatives hedge underlying commodity price risk and were not entered into for trading or speculative purposes. Net Revenue and Operating Profit Net revenue and operating profit of each division are as follows: Net Revenue Operating Profit 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 2019 FLNA $ 19,608 $ 18,189 $ 17,078 $ 5,633 $ 5,340 $ 5,258 QFNA 2,751 2,742 2,482 578 669 544 PBNA 25,276 22,559 21,730 2,442 1,937 2,179 LatAm 8,108 6,942 7,573 1,369 1,033 1,141 Europe 13,038 11,922 11,728 1,292 1,353 1,327 AMESA (a) 6,078 4,573 3,651 858 600 671 APAC (b) 4,615 3,445 2,919 673 590 477 Total division 79,474 70,372 67,161 12,845 11,522 11,597 Corporate unallocated expenses — — — ( 1,683 ) ( 1,442 ) ( 1,306 ) Total $ 79,474 $ 70,372 $ 67,161 $ 11,162 $ 10,080 $ 10,291 (a) The increase in net revenue reflects our acquisition of Pioneer Foods. See Note 13 for further information. (b) The increase in net revenue reflects our acquisition of Be & Cheery. See Note 13 for further information. Our primary performance obligation is the distribution and sales of beverage and convenient food products to our customers. The following table reflects the approximate percentage of net revenue generated between our beverage business and our convenient food business for each of our international divisions, as well as our consolidated net revenue: 2021 2020 2019 Beverage (a) Convenient Food Beverage (a) Convenient Food Beverage (a) Convenient Food LatAm 10 % 90 % 10 % 90 % 10 % 90 % Europe 55 % 45 % 55 % 45 % 55 % 45 % AMESA (b) 30 % 70 % 30 % 70 % 40 % 60 % APAC 20 % 80 % 25 % 75 % 25 % 75 % PepsiCo 45 % 55 % 45 % 55 % 45 % 55 % (a) Beverage revenue from company-owned bottlers, which primarily includes our consolidated bottling operations in our PBNA and Europe segments, is approximately 40 % of our consolidated net revenue. Generally, our finished goods beverage operations produce higher net revenue, but lower operating margins as compared to concentrate sold to authorized bottling partners for the manufacture of finished goods beverages. (b) The increase in the approximate percentage of net revenue generated by our convenient food business in 2020 primarily reflects our acquisition of Pioneer Foods. See Note 13 for further information. 67 Table of Contents Operating profit in 2021 and 2020 includes certain pre-tax charges/credits taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

(c) The increase in net revenue reflects our acquisition of Pioneer Foods. See Note 13 for further information. Note 2 — Our Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when our performance obligation is satisfied. Our primary performance obligation (the distribution and sales of beverage and convenient food products) is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to our customers, which is also when control is transferred. Merchandising activities are performed after a customer obtains control of the product, are accounted for as fulfillment of our performance obligation to ship or deliver product to our customers and are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Merchandising activities are immaterial in the context of our contracts. In addition, we exclude from net revenue all sales, use, value-added and certain excise taxes assessed by government authorities on revenue producing transactions. The transfer of control of products to our customers is typically based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return. However, our policy for DSD, including certain chilled products, is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect. Similarly, our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. As a result, we record reserves, based on estimates, for anticipated damaged and out-of-date produc ts. Our products are sold for cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry practices, typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the United States, and generally within 30 to 90 days internationally, and may allow discounts for early payment. We estimate and reserve for our expected credit loss exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility, write-off history, the aging of accounts receivable, our analysis of customer data, and forward-looking information (including the expected impact of the global economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic), leveraging estimates of creditworthiness and projections of default and recovery rates for certain of our customers. We are exposed to concentration of credit risk from our major customers, including Walmart. We have not experienced credit issues with these customers. In 2021, sales to Walmart and its affiliates (including Sam’s) represented approximately 13 % of our consolidated net revenue, including concentrate sales to our independent bottlers, which were used in finished goods sold by them to Walmart. Total Marketplace Spending We offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to customers for performing activities on our behalf, such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new products, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices. Sales incentives and discounts also include support provided to our independent bottlers through funding of advertising and other marketing activities. A number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur after year end once reconciled and settled. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance 70 Table of Contents levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred. The terms of most of our incentive arrangements do not exceed one year and, therefore, do not require highly uncertain long-term estimates. Certain arrangements, such as fountain pouring rights, may extend beyond one year. Upfront payments to customers under these arrangements are recognized over the shorter of the economic or contractual life, primarily as a reduction of revenue, and the remaining balances of $ 262 million as of December 25, 2021 and $ 299 million as of December 26, 2020 are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on our balance sheet. For interim reporting, our policy is to allocate our forecasted full-year sales incentives for most of our programs to each of our interim reporting periods in the same year that benefits from the programs. The allocation methodology is based on our forecasted sales incentives for the full year and the proportion of each interim period’s actual gross revenue or volume, as applicable, to our forecasted annual gross revenue or volume, as applicable. Based on our review of the forecasts at each interim period, any changes in estimates and the related allocation of sales incentives are recognized beginning in the interim period that they are identified. In addition, we apply a similar allocation methodology for interim reporting purposes for certain advertising and other marketing activities. Our annual consolidated financial statements are not impacted by this interim allocation methodology. Advertising and other marketing activities, reported as selling, general and administrative expenses, totaled $ 5.1 billion in 2021, $ 4.6 billion in 2020 and $ 4.7 billion in 2019, including advertising expenses of $ 3.5 billion in 2021 and $ 3.0 billion in both 2020 and 2019. Deferred advertising costs are not expensed until the year first used and consist of: • media and personal service prepayments; • promotional materials in inventory; and • production costs of future media advertising. Deferred advertising costs of $ 53 million and $ 48 million as of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, respectively, are classified as prepaid expenses and other current assets on our balance sheet. Distribution Costs Distribution costs, including the costs of shipping and handling activities, which include certain merchandising activities, are reported as selling, general and administrative expenses. Shipping and handling expenses were $ 13.7 billion in 2021, $ 11.9 billion in 2020 and $ 10.9 billion in 2019. Software Costs We capitalize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use when both the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable that the software will be used as intended. Capitalized software costs include (1) external direct costs of materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining computer software, (2) compensation and related benefits for employees who are directly associated with the software projects and (3) interest costs incurred while developing internal-use computer software. Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and equipment on our balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis when placed into service over the estimated useful lives of the software, which approximate five to 10 years. Software amortization totaled $ 135 million in 2021, $ 152 million in 2020 and $ 166 million in 2019. Net capitalized software and development costs were $ 809 million and $ 664 million as of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, respectively. 71 Table of Contents Commitments and Contingencies We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, certain taxes and environmental matters, as well as commitments under contractual and other commercial obligations. We recognize liabilities for contingencies and commitments when a loss is probable and estimable. Research and Development We engage in a variety of research and development activities and continue to invest to accelerate growth and to drive innovation globally. Consumer research is excluded from research and development costs and included in other marketing costs. Research and development costs were $ 752 million, $ 719 million and $ 711 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are reported within selling, general and administrative expenses. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and, as a result, are assessed for impairment at least annually, using either a qualitative or quantitative approach. We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Where we use the qualitative assessment, first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered include macroeconomic (including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic), industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environment, historical financial performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed. In the quantitative assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, an assessment is performed to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and the reporting unit, respectively. Estimated fair value is determined using discounted cash flows and requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with management’s strategic business plans, annual sales growth rates, perpetuity growth assumptions and the selection of assumptions underlying a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. Significant management judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeconomic and other factors (including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic) to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, such as forecasted growth rates (including perpetuity growth assumptions) and weighted-average cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. A deterioration in these assumptions could adversely impact our results. Amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows. See Note 4 for further information. Other Significant Accounting Policies Our other significant accounting policies are disclosed as follows: • Basis of Presentation – Note 1 includes a description of our policies regarding use of estimates, basis of presentation and consolidation. • Income Taxes – Note 5. • Share-Based Compensation – Note 6. 72 Table of Contents • Pension, Retiree Medical and Savings Plans – Note 7. • Financial Instruments – Note 9. • Cash Equivalents – Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. • Inventories – Note 14. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the average; first-in, first-out (FIFO); or, in limited instances, last-in, first-out (LIFO) methods. • Property, Plant and Equipment – Note 14. Property, plant and equipment is recorded at historical cost. Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis over an asset’s estimated useful life. Construction in progress is not depreciated until ready for service. • Translation of Financial Statements of Foreign Subsidiaries – Financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and average exchange rates for revenues and expenses. Adjustments resulting from translating net assets are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders’ equity as currency translation adjustment. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements - Adopted In 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes. The guidance primarily addresses how to (1) recognize a deferred tax liability after we transition to or from the equity method of accounting, (2) evaluate if a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill is related to a business combination or is a separate transaction, (3) recognize all of the effects of a change in tax law in the period of enactment, including adjusting the estimated annual tax rate, and (4) include the amount of tax based on income in the income tax provision and any incremental amount as a tax not based on income for hybrid tax regimes. We adopted the guidance in the first quarter of 2021. The adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures. Note 3 — Restructuring and Impairment Charges 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan The 2019 Productivity Plan, publicly announced on February 15, 2019, will leverage new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. To build on the successful implementation of the 2019 Productivity Plan to date, we expanded and extended the plan through the end of 2026 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives described above. We now expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $ 3.15 billion, including cash expenditures of approximately $ 2.4 billion, as compared to our previous estimate of pre-tax charges of approximately $ 2.5 billion, which included cash expenditures of approximately $ 1.6 billion. These pre-tax charges are expected to consist of approximately 55 % of severance and other employee-related costs, 10 % for asset impairments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related actions and 35 % for other costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives. The total expected plan pre-tax charges are expected to be incurred by division approximately as follows: FLNA QFNA PBNA LatAm Europe AMESA APAC Corporate Expected pre-tax charges 15 % 1 % 25 % 10 % 25 % 5 % 4 % 15 % 73 Table of Contents A summary of our 2019 Productivity Plan charges is as follows: 2021 2020 2019 Cost of sales $ 29 $ 30 $ 115 Selling, general and administrative expenses 208 239 253 Other pension and retiree medical benefits expense 10 20 2 Total restructuring and impairment charges $ 247 $ 289 $ 370 After-tax amount $ 206 $ 231 $ 303 Impact on net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share $ ( 0.15 ) $ ( 0.17 ) $ ( 0.21 ) 2021 2020 2019 Plan to Date through 12/25/2021 FLNA $ 28 $ 83 $ 22 $ 164 QFNA — 5 2 12 PBNA 20 47 51 158 LatAm 37 31 62 139 Europe 81 48 99 234 AMESA 15 14 38 70 APAC 7 5 47 61 Corporate 49 36 47 139 237 269 368 977 Other pension and retiree medical benefits expense 10 20 2 67 Total $ 247 $ 289 $ 370 $ 1,044 Plan to Date through 12/25/2021 Severance and other employee costs $ 564 Asset impairments 157 Other costs 323 Total $ 1,044 Severance and other employee costs primarily include severance and other termination benefits, as well as voluntary separation arrangements. Other costs primarily include costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives, including contract termination costs, consulting and other professional fees. 74 Table of Contents A summary of our 2019 Productivity Plan activity is as follows: Severance and Other Employee Costs Asset Impairments Other Costs Total Liability as of December 29, 2018 $ 105 $ — $ 1 $ 106 2019 restructuring charges 149 92 129 370 Cash payments (a) ( 138 ) — ( 119 ) ( 257 ) Non-cash charges and translation 12 ( 92 ) 10 ( 70 ) Liability as of December 28, 2019 128 — 21 149 2020 restructuring charges 158 33 98 289 Cash payments (a) ( 138 ) — ( 117 ) ( 255 ) Non-cash charges and translation ( 26 ) ( 33 ) 3 ( 56 ) Liability as of December 26, 2020 122 — 5 127 2021 restructuring charges 120 32 95 247 Cash payments (a) ( 163 ) — ( 93 ) ( 256 ) Non-cash charges and translation ( 15 ) ( 32 ) — ( 47 ) Liability as of December 25, 2021 $ 64 $ — $ 7 $ 71 (a) Excludes cash expenditures of $ 2 million in both 2021 and 2020, and $ 4 million in 2019, reported in the cash flow statement in pension and retiree medical plan contributions. Substantially all of the restructuring accrual at December 25, 2021 is expected to be paid by the end of 2022. Other Productivity Initiatives There were no material charges related to other productivity and efficiency initiatives outside the scope of the 2019 Productivity Plan. We regularly evaluate different productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plan and other initiatives described above. Note 4 — Intangible Assets A summary of our amortizable intangible assets is as follows: 2021 2020 2019 Average Useful Life (Years) Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Acquired franchise rights (a) 56 – 60 $ 976 $ ( 187 ) $ 789 $ 976 $ ( 173 ) $ 803 Customer relationships 10 – 24 623 ( 227 ) 396 642 ( 204 ) 438 Brands (b) 20 – 40 1,151 ( 989 ) 162 1,348 ( 1,099 ) 249 Other identifiable intangibles 10 – 24 451 ( 260 ) 191 474 ( 261 ) 213 Total $ 3,201 $ ( 1,663 ) $ 1,538 $ 3,440 $ ( 1,737 ) $ 1,703 Amortization expense $ 91 $ 90 $ 81 (a) Acquired franchise rights includes our distribution agreement with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., with an expected residual value higher than our carrying value. The distribution agreement’s useful life is three years, in accordance with the three-year termination notice issued, and is not reflected in the average useful life above. (b) The change primarily reflects assets reclassified as held for sale in connection with our Juice Transaction. See Note 13 for further information. 75 Table of Contents Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis over an intangible asset’s estimated useful life. Amortization of intangible assets for each of the next five years, based on existing intangible assets as of December 25, 2021 and using average 2021 foreign exchange rates, is expected to be as follows: 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 Five-year projected amortization $ 84 $ 84 $ 83 $ 81 $ 72 Depreciable and amortizable assets are evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. In these circumstances, if an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on discounted future cash flows. Useful lives are periodically evaluated to determine whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate the need for revision. Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets We did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in each of the years ended December 25, 2021, December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019. We did not recognize any impairment charges for indefinite-lived intangible assets in the year ended December 25, 2021. In 2020, we recognized a pre-tax impairment charge of $ 41 million related to a coconut water brand in PBNA. We did not recognize any material impairment charges for indefinite-lived intangible assets in the year ended December 28, 2019. As of December 25, 2021, the estimated fair values of our indefinite-lived reacquired and acquired franchise rights recorded at PBNA exceeded their carrying values. However, there could be an impairment of the carrying value of PBNA’s reacquired and acquired franchise rights if future revenues and their contribution to the operating results of PBNA’s CSD business do not achieve our expected future cash flows or if macroeconomic conditions result in a future increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value. We have also analyzed the impact of the macroeconomic conditions in Russia on the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in Russia and have concluded that there are no impairments for the year ended December 25, 2021. The estimated fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets is dependent on macroeconomic conditions (including a resulting increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value), future revenues and their contributions to operating results and expected future cash flows (including perpetuity growth assumptions), and significant changes in the decisions regarding assets that do not perform consistent with our expectations. Subsequent to December 25, 2021, we discontinued or repositioned certain juice and dairy brands in Russia in our Europe segment. As a result, we will recognize pre-tax impairment charges of approximately $ 0.2 billion in the first quarter of 2022 in selling, general and administrative expenses. For further information on our policies for indefinite-lived intangible assets, see Note 2. 76 Table of Contents The change in the book value of indefinite-lived intangible assets is as follows: Balance, Beginning 2020 Acquisitions Translation and Other Balance, End of 2020 Acquisitions/(Divestitures) Translation and Other Balance, End of 2021 FLNA (a) Goodwill $ 299 $ 164 $ 2 $ 465 $ ( 8 ) $ 1 $ 458 Brands 162 179 ( 1 ) 340 — — 340 Total 461 343 1 805 ( 8 ) 1 798 QFNA Goodwill 189 — — 189 — — 189 Brands 11 — ( 11 ) — — — — Total 200 — ( 11 ) 189 — — 189 PBNA (b) (c) Goodwill 9,898 2,280 11 12,189 ( 216 ) 1 11,974 Reacquired franchise rights 7,089 — 18 7,107 — — 7,107 Acquired franchise rights 1,517 16 3 1,536 1 1 1,538 Brands (d) 763 2,400 ( 41 ) 3,122 ( 290 ) ( 324 ) 2,508 Total 19,267 4,696 ( 9 ) 23,954 ( 505 ) ( 322 ) 23,127 LatAm Goodwill 501 — ( 43 ) 458 — ( 25 ) 433 Brands 125 — ( 17 ) 108 ( 1 ) ( 7 ) 100 Total 626 — ( 60 ) 566 ( 1 ) ( 32 ) 533 Europe (b) Goodwill (e) 3,961 ( 2 ) ( 153 ) 3,806 ( 28 ) ( 78 ) 3,700 Reacquired franchise rights (e) 505 — ( 9 ) 496 ( 23 ) ( 32 ) 441 Acquired franchise rights (e) 157 — 15 172 — ( 14 ) 158 Brands (f) 4,181 — ( 109 ) 4,072 — 182 4,254 Total 8,804 ( 2 ) ( 256 ) 8,546 ( 51 ) 58 8,553 AMESA (g) Goodwill 446 560 90 1,096 ( 2 ) ( 31 ) 1,063 Brands — 183 31 214 — ( 9 ) 205 Total 446 743 121 1,310 ( 2 ) ( 40 ) 1,268 APAC (h) Goodwill 207 306 41 554 3 7 564 Brands (d) 100 309 36 445 — 31 476 Total 307 615 77 999 3 38 1,040 Total goodwill 15,501 3,308 ( 52 ) 18,757 ( 251 ) ( 125 ) 18,381 Total reacquired franchise rights 7,594 — 9 7,603 ( 23 ) ( 32 ) 7,548 Total acquired franchise rights 1,674 16 18 1,708 1 ( 13 ) 1,696 Total brands 5,342 3,071 ( 112 ) 8,301 ( 291 ) ( 127 ) 7,883 Total $ 30,111 $ 6,395 $ ( 137 ) $ 36,369 $ ( 564 ) $ ( 297 ) $ 35,508 (a) Acquisitions/divestitures in 2021 and acquisitions in 2020 primarily reflect our acquisition of BFY Brands.

See Note 13 for further information. (h) Acquisitions in 2020 primarily reflects our acquisition of Be & Cheery. See Note 13 for further information. Note 5 — Income Taxes The components of income before income taxes are as follows: 2021 2020 2019 United States $ 3,740 $ 4,070 $ 4,123 Foreign 6,081 4,999 5,189 $ 9,821 $ 9,069 $ 9,312 The provision for income taxes consisted of the following: 2021 2020 2019 Current: U.S. Federal $ 702 $ 715 $ 652 Foreign 955 932 807 State 44 110 196 1,701 1,757 1,655 Deferred: U.S. Federal 375 273 325 Foreign ( 14 ) ( 167 ) ( 31 ) State 80 31 10 441 137 304 $ 2,142 $ 1,894 $ 1,959 A reconciliation of the U.S. Federal statutory tax rate to our annual tax rate is as follows: 2021 2020 2019 U.S. Federal statutory tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 % State income tax, net of U.S. Federal tax benefit 1.0 1.2 1.6 Lower taxes on foreign results ( 1.6 ) ( 0.8 ) ( 0.9 ) One-time mandatory transition tax - TCJ Act 1.9 — ( 0.1 ) Other, net ( 0.5 ) ( 0.5 ) ( 0.6 ) Annual tax rate 21.8 % 20.9 % 21.0 % Tax Cuts and Jobs Act In 2021, we recorded $ 190 million ($ 0.14 per share) of net tax expense related to the TCJ Act as a result of adjustments related to the final assessment of the 2014 through 2016 IRS audit . There were no tax amounts recognized in 2020 related to the TCJ Act. In 2019, we recognized a net tax benefit totaling $ 8 million ($ 0.01 per share) related to the TCJ Act. As of December 25, 2021, our mandatory transition tax liability was $ 2.9 billion, which must be paid through 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act. We reduced our liability through cash payments and application of tax overpayments by $ 309 million in 2021, $ 78 million in 2020 and $ 663 million in 2019. We currently expect to pay approximately $ 309 million of this liability in 2022. The TCJ Act also created a requirement that certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries, known as global intangible low-tax income (GILTI), must be included in the gross income of their U.S. shareholder. The FASB allows an accounting policy election of either recognizing deferred taxes for temporary 78 Table of Contents differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or recognizing such taxes as a current-period expense when incurred. We elected to treat the tax effect of GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred. Other Tax Matters In 2021, we received a final assessment from the IRS audit for the tax years 2014 through 2016. The assessment included both agreed and unagreed issues. On October 29, 2021, we filed a formal written protest of the assessment and requested an appeals conference. As a result of the analysis of the 2014 through 2016 final assessment, we remeasured all applicable reserves for uncertain tax positions for all years open under the statute of limitations, including any correlating adjustments impacting the mandatory transition tax liability under the TCJ Act, resulting in a net non-cash tax expense of $ 112 million in 2021. On May 19, 2019, a public referendum held in Switzerland passed the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (TRAF), effective January 1, 2020. The enactment of certain provisions of the TRAF resulted in adjustments to our deferred taxes. During 2021, no income tax adjustments related to the TRAF were recorded. During 2020, we recorded a net tax benefit of $ 72 million related to the adoption of the TRAF in the Swiss Canton of Bern. During 2019, we recorded a net tax expense of $ 24 million related to the impact of the TRAF. While the accounting for the impacts of the TRAF are deemed to be complete, further adjustments to our financial statements and related disclosures could be made in future quarters, including in connection with final tax return filings. Deferred tax liabilities and assets are comprised of the following: 2021 2020 Deferred tax liabilities Debt guarantee of wholly-owned subsidiary $ 578 $ 578 Property, plant and equipment 2,036 1,851 Recapture of net operating losses 504 504 Pension liabilities 216 — Right-of-use assets 450 371 Other 254 159 Gross deferred tax liabilities 4,038 3,463 Deferred tax assets Net carryforwards 4,974 5,008 Intangible assets other than nondeductible goodwill 1,111 1,146 Share-based compensation 98 90 Retiree medical benefits 147 153 Other employee-related benefits 379 373 Pension benefits — 80 Deductible state tax and interest benefits 149 150 Lease liabilities 450 371 Other 842 866 Gross deferred tax assets 8,150 8,237 Valuation allowances ( 4,628 ) ( 4,686 ) Deferred tax assets, net 3,522 3,551 Net deferred tax liabilities/(assets) $ 516 $ ( 88 ) 79 Table of Contents A summary of our valuation allowance activity is as follows: 2021 2020 2019 Balance, beginning of year $ 4,686 $ 3,599 $ 3,753 Provision ( 9 ) 1,082 ( 124 ) Other (deductions)/additions ( 49 ) 5 ( 30 ) Balance, end of year $ 4,628 $ 4,686 $ 3,599 Reserves A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. Our major taxing jurisdictions and the related open tax audits are as follows: Jurisdiction Years Open to Audit Years Currently Under Audit United States 2014-2020 2014-2019 Mexico 2014-2020 2014-2016 United Kingdom 2018-2020 None Canada (Domestic) 2016-2020 2016-2017 Canada (International) 2010-2020 2010-2017 Russia 2018-2020 None Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning strategies and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we likely will not succeed. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit, new tax laws, relevant court cases or tax authority settlements. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate in the year of resolution. As of December 25, 2021, the total gross amount of reserves for income taxes, reported in other liabilities, was $ 1.9 billion. We accrue interest related to reserves for income taxes in our provision for income taxes and any associated penalties are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. The gross amount of interest accrued, reported in other liabilities, was $ 326 million as of December 25, 2021, of which $ 3 million of tax benefit was recognized in 2021. The gross amount of interest accrued, reported in other liabilities, was $ 338 million as of December 26, 2020, of which $ 93 million of tax expense was recognized in 2020. 80 Table of Contents A reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: 2021 2020 Balance, beginning of year $ 1,621 $ 1,395 Additions for tax positions related to the current year 222 128 Additions for tax positions from prior years 681 153 Reductions for tax positions from prior years ( 558 ) ( 22 ) Settlement payments ( 25 ) ( 13 ) Statutes of limitations expiration ( 39 ) ( 23 ) Translation and other ( 2 ) 3 Balance, end of year $ 1,900 $ 1,621 Carryforwards and Allowances Operating loss carryforwards totaling $ 30.0 billion as of December 25, 2021 are being carried forward in a number of foreign and state jurisdictions where we are permitted to use tax operating losses from prior periods to reduce future taxable income. These operating losses will expire as follows: $ 0.3 billion in 2022, $ 26.8 billion between 2023 and 2041 and $ 2.9 billion may be carried forward indefinitely. We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is not more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized. Undistributed International Earnings As of December 25, 2021, we had approximately $ 7 billion of undistributed international earnings. We intend to continue to reinvest $ 7 billion of earnings outside the United States for the foreseeable future and while future distribution of these earnings would not be subject to U.S. federal tax expense, no deferred tax liabilities with respect to items such as certain foreign exchange gains or losses, foreign withholding taxes or state taxes have been recognized. It is not practicable for us to determine the amount of unrecognized tax expense on these reinvested international earnings. Note 6 — Share-Based Compensation Our share-based compensation program is designed to attract and retain employees while also aligning employees’ interests with the interests of our shareholders. PepsiCo has granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs and long-term cash awards to employees under the shareholder-approved PepsiCo, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). Executives who are awarded long-term incentives based on their performance may generally elect to receive their grant in the form of stock options or RSUs, or a combination thereof. Executives who elect stock options receive four stock options for every one RSU that would have otherwise been granted. Certain executive officers and other senior executives do not have a choice and are granted 66 % PSUs and 34 % long-term cash, each of which are subject to pre-established performance targets. The Company may use authorized and unissued shares to meet share requirements resulting from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of RSUs and PSUs. As of December 25, 2021, 44 million shares were available for future share-based compensation grants under the LTIP. 81 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our total share-based compensation expense, which is primarily recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, and excess tax benefits recognized: 2021 2020 2019 Share-based compensation expense - equity awards $ 301 $ 264 $ 237 Share-based compensation expense - liability awards 20 11 8 Restructuring charges 1 ( 1 ) ( 2 ) Total $ 322 $ 274 $ 243 Income tax benefits recognized in earnings related to share-based compensation $ 57 $ 48 $ 39 Excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation $ 38 $ 35 $ 50 As of December 25, 2021, there was $ 372 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation grants. This unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of two years . Method of Accounting and Our Assumptions The fair value of share-based award grants is amortized to expense over the vesting period, primarily three years . Awards to employees eligible for retirement prior to the award becoming fully vested are amortized to expense over the period through the date that the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide service to earn the award. In addition, we use historical data to estimate forfeiture rates and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. We do not backdate, reprice or grant share-based compensation awards retroactively. Repricing of awards would require shareholder approval under the LTIP. Stock Options A stock option permits the holder to purchase shares of PepsiCo common stock at a specified price. We account for our employee stock options under the fair value method of accounting using a Black-Scholes valuation model to measure stock option expense at the date of grant. All stock option grants have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and generally have a 10 -year term. Our weighted-average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions are as follows: 2021 2020 2019 Expected life 7 years 6 years 5 years Risk-free interest rate 1.1 % 0.9 % 2.4 % Expected volatility 14 % 14 % 14 % Expected dividend yield 3.1 % 3.4 % 3.1 % The expected life is the period over which our employee groups are expected to hold their options. It is based on our historical experience with similar grants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the expected U.S. Treasury rate over the expected life. Volatility reflects movements in our stock price over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life. Dividend yield is estimated over the expected life based on our stated dividend policy and forecasts of net income, share repurchases and stock price. 82 Table of Contents A summary of our stock option activity for the year ended December 25, 2021 is as follows: Options (a) Weighted-Average Exercise Price Weighted-Average Contractual Life Remaining (years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (a) Outstanding at December 26, 2020 10,640 $ 99.54 Granted 2,157 $ 134.25 Exercised ( 2,321 ) $ 79.87 Forfeited/expired ( 334 ) $ 125.35 Outstanding at December 25, 2021 10,142 $ 110.54 5.79 $ 600,755 Exercisable at December 25, 2021 5,407 $ 93.49 3.47 $ 412,524 Expected to vest as of December 25, 2021 4,419 $ 129.78 8.41 $ 176,771 (a) In thousands. Restricted Stock Units and Performance Stock Units Each RSU represents our obligation to deliver to the holder one share of PepsiCo common stock when the award vests at the end of the service period. PSUs are awards pursuant to which a number of shares are delivered to the holder upon vesting at the end of the service period based on PepsiCo’s performance against specified financial performance metrics. The number of shares may be increased to the maximum or reduced to the minimum threshold based on the results of these performance metrics in accordance with the terms established at the time of the award. During the vesting period, RSUs and PSUs accrue dividend equivalents that pay out in cash (without interest) if and when the applicable RSU or PSU vests and becomes payable. The fair value of RSUs and PSUs are measured at the market price of the Company’s stock on the date of grant. A summary of our RSU and PSU activity for the year ended December 25, 2021 is as follows: RSUs/PSUs (a) Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value Weighted-Average Contractual Life Remaining (years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (a) Outstanding at December 26, 2020 6,127 $ 119.92 Granted 2,636 $ 131.81 Converted ( 2,229 ) $ 112.09 Forfeited ( 557 ) $ 126.70 Outstanding at December 25, 2021 (b) 5,977 $ 127.45 1.31 $ 1,014,854 Expected to vest as of December 25, 2021 (c) 6,016 $ 127.59 1.30 $ 1,021,312 (a) In thousands.

In 2021, we adopted a change to the Canadian defined benefit plans to freeze pension accruals for salaried participants, effective January 1, 2024, and to close the hourly plan to new non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2022. After the effective date, all salaried participants will receive an employer contribution to the defined contribution plan based on age and years of service regardless of employee contribution and will have the opportunity to receive employer contributions to match employee contributions up to defined limits. We also adopted a change to the U.K. defined benefit plan to freeze pension accruals for all participants effective March 31, 2022. After the effective date, participants will have the opportunity to receive employer contributions to match employee contributions up to defined limits. Pre-tax pension benefits expense will decrease after the effective dates, partially offset by contributions to defined contribution plans. In 2021, we adopted a change to the U.S. qualified defined benefit plans to transfer certain participants from PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan A (Plan A) to PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan I (Plan I), effective January 1, 2022. The benefits offered to the plans’ participants were unchanged. There is no material impact to pre-tax pension benefits expense from this transaction. In 2020, lump sum distributions exceeded the total of annual service and interest cost and triggered a pre-tax settlement charge in Plan A of $ 205 million ($ 158 million after-tax or $ 0.11 per share). In 2020, we adopted an amendment to the U.S. defined benefit pension plans to freeze benefit accruals for salaried participants, effective December 31, 2025. Since 2011, salaried new hires are not eligible to participate in the defined benefit plan. After the effective date, all salaried participants will receive an employer contribution to the 401(k) savings plan based on age and years of service regardless of employee contribution and will have the opportunity to receive employer contributions to match employee contributions up to defined limits. As a result of this amendment, pre-tax pension benefits expense decreased $ 70 million in 2021, primarily impacting corporate unallocated expenses. In 2020, we approved an amendment to reorganize the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans that resulted in the transfer of certain participants from Plan A to Plan I and to a newly created plan, PepsiCo Employees Retirement Hourly Plan (Plan H), effective January 1, 2021. The benefits offered to the plans’ participants were unchanged. The reorganization facilitated a more targeted investment strategy and provided additional flexibility in evaluating opportunities to reduce risk and volatility. There was no material impact to pre-tax pension benefits expense as a result of this reorganization. In 2020, we adopted an amendment, effective January 1, 2021, to enhance the pay credit benefits of certain participants in Plan H. As a result of this amendment, pre-tax pension benefits expense increased $ 45 million in 2021, primarily impacting service cost expense. In 2019, Plan A purchased a group annuity contract whereby a third-party insurance company assumed the obligation to pay and administer future annuity payments for certain retirees. This transaction triggered a pre-tax settlement charge in 2019 of $ 220 million ($ 170 million after-tax or $ 0.12 per share). Also in 2019, certain former employees who had vested benefits in our U.S. defined benefit pension plans were offered the option of receiving a one-time lump sum payment equal to the present value of the participant’s pension benefit. This transaction triggered a pre-tax settlement charge in 2019 of $ 53 million ($ 41 million after-tax or $ 0.03 per share). Collectively, the group annuity contract and one-time lump sum payments to certain former employees who had vested benefits resulted in settlement charges in 2019 of $ 273 million ($ 211 million after-tax or $ 0.15 per share). 85 Table of Contents Gains and losses resulting from actual experience differing from our assumptions, including the difference between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets, as well as changes in our assumptions, are determined at each measurement date. These differences are recognized as a component of net gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss. If this net accumulated gain or loss exceeds 10 % of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or plan obligations, a portion of the net gain or loss is included in other pension and retiree medical benefits (expense)/income for the following year based upon the average remaining service life for participants in Plan A (approximately 9 years), Plan H (approximately 11 years) and retiree medical (approximately 9 years), and the remaining life expectancy for participants in Plan I (approximately 27 years). The cost or benefit of plan changes that increase or decrease benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost/(credit)) is included in other pension and retiree medical benefits (expense)/income on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service life for participants in both Plan A and Plan H, except that prior service cost/(credit) for salaried participants subject to the freeze is amortized on a straight-line basis over the period up to the effective date of the freeze, or the remaining life expectancy for participants in Plan I. 86 Table of Contents Selected financial information for our pension and retiree medical plans is as follows: Pension Retiree Medical U.S. International 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 Change in projected benefit obligation Obligation at beginning of year $ 16,753 $ 15,230 $ 4,430 $ 3,753 $ 1,006 $ 988 Service cost 518 434 104 86 33 25 Interest cost 324 435 74 85 15 25 Plan amendments 23 ( 221 ) 3 ( 17 ) — ( 25 ) Participant contributions — — 3 2 — — Experience (gain)/loss ( 215 ) 2,042 ( 178 ) 467 ( 17 ) 81 Benefit payments ( 976 ) ( 378 ) ( 106 ) ( 92 ) ( 83 ) ( 89 ) Settlement/curtailment ( 220 ) ( 808 ) ( 99 ) ( 24 ) — — Special termination benefits 9 19 — — — — Other, including foreign currency adjustment — — ( 56 ) 170 — 1 Obligation at end of year $ 16,216 $ 16,753 $ 4,175 $ 4,430 $ 954 $ 1,006 Change in fair value of plan assets Fair value at beginning of year $ 15,465 $ 14,302 $ 4,303 $ 3,732 $ 315 $ 302 Actual return on plan assets 1,052 1,908 387 401 20 47 Employer contributions/funding 580 387 158 120 47 55 Participant contributions — — 3 2 — — Benefit payments ( 976 ) ( 378 ) ( 106 ) ( 92 ) ( 83 ) ( 89 ) Settlement ( 217 ) ( 754 ) ( 52 ) ( 29 ) — — Other, including foreign currency adjustment — — ( 69 ) 169 — — Fair value at end of year $ 15,904 $ 15,465 $ 4,624 $ 4,303 $ 299 $ 315 Funded status $ ( 312 ) $ ( 1,288 ) $ 449 $ ( 127 ) $ ( 655 ) $ ( 691 ) Amounts recognized Other assets $ 692 $ 797 $ 564 $ 110 $ — $ — Other current liabilities ( 48 ) ( 53 ) ( 1 ) ( 1 ) ( 57 ) ( 51 ) Other liabilities ( 956 ) ( 2,032 ) ( 114 ) ( 236 ) ( 598 ) ( 640 ) Net amount recognized $ ( 312 ) $ ( 1,288 ) $ 449 $ ( 127 ) $ ( 655 ) $ ( 691 ) Amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive loss (pre-tax) Net loss/(gain) $ 3,550 $ 4,116 $ 696 $ 1,149 $ ( 220 ) $ ( 212 ) Prior service (credit)/cost ( 63 ) ( 119 ) ( 11 ) ( 19 ) ( 34 ) ( 45 ) Total $ 3,487 $ 3,997 $ 685 $ 1,130 $ ( 254 ) $ ( 257 ) Changes recognized in net (gain)/loss included in other comprehensive loss Net (gain)/loss arising in current year $ ( 301 ) $ 1,009 $ ( 355 ) $ 268 $ ( 22 ) $ 50 Amortization and settlement recognition ( 265 ) ( 409 ) ( 95 ) ( 75 ) 14 23 Foreign currency translation (gain)/loss — — ( 3 ) 42 — — Total $ ( 566 ) $ 600 $ ( 453 ) $ 235 $ ( 8 ) $ 73 Accumulated benefit obligation at end of year $ 15,489 $ 15,949 $ 4,021 $ 4,108 The net gain arising in the current year is primarily attributable to the increase in discount rate offset by actual experience differing from demographic assumptions. The amount we report in operating profit as pension and retiree medical cost is service cost, which is the value of benefits earned by employees for working during the year. 87 Table of Contents The amounts we report below operating profit as pension and retiree medical cost consist of the following components: • Interest cost is the accrued interest on the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time. • Expected return on plan assets is the long-term return we expect to earn on plan investments for our funded plans that will be used to settle future benefit obligations. • Amortization of prior service cost/(credit) represents the recognition in the income statement of benefit changes resulting from plan amendments. • Amortization of net loss/(gain) represents the recognition in the income statement of changes in the amount of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation based on changes in assumptions and actual experience. • Settlement/curtailment loss/(gain) represents the result of actions that effectively eliminate all or a portion of related projected benefit obligations. Settlements are triggered when payouts to settle the projected benefit obligation of a plan due to lump sums or other events exceed the annual service and interest cost. Settlements are recognized when actions are irrevocable and we are relieved of the primary responsibility and risk for projected benefit obligations. Lump sum payouts are generally higher when interest rates are lower. Curtailments are recognized when events such as plant closures, the sale of a business, or plan changes result in a significant reduction of future service or benefits. Curtailment losses are recognized when an event is probable and estimable, while curtailment gains are recognized when an event has occurred (when the related employees terminate or an amendment is adopted). • Special termination benefits are the additional benefits offered to employees upon departure due to actions such as restructuring. The components of total pension and retiree medical benefit costs are as follows: Pension Retiree Medical U.S. International 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 2019 Service cost $ 518 $ 434 $ 381 $ 104 $ 86 $ 73 $ 33 $ 25 $ 23 Other pension and retiree medical benefits (income)/expense: Interest cost $ 324 $ 435 $ 543 $ 74 $ 85 $ 97 $ 15 $ 25 $ 36 Expected return on plan assets ( 970 ) ( 929 ) ( 892 ) ( 231 ) ( 202 ) ( 188 ) ( 15 ) ( 16 ) ( 18 ) Amortization of prior service (credits)/cost ( 31 ) 12 10 ( 2 ) — — ( 11 ) ( 12 ) ( 19 ) Amortization of net losses/(gains) 224 196 161 77 61 32 ( 14 ) ( 23 ) ( 27 ) Settlement/curtailment losses/(gains) (a) 40 213 296 ( 11 ) 19 12 — — — Special termination benefits 9 19 1 — — — — — — Total other pension and retiree medical benefits (income)/expense $ ( 404 ) $ ( 54 ) $ 119 $ ( 93 ) $ ( 37 ) $ ( 47 ) $ ( 25 ) $ ( 26 ) $ ( 28 ) Total $ 114 $ 380 $ 500 $ 11 $ 49 $ 26 $ 8 $ ( 1 ) $ ( 5 ) (a) In 2020, U.S. includes a settlement charge of $ 205 million ($ 158 million after-tax or $ 0.11 per share) related to lump sum distributions exceeding the total of annual service and interest cost. In 2019, U.S. includes settlement charges related to the purchase of a group annuity contract of $ 220 million ($ 170 million after-tax or $ 0.12 per share) and a pension lump sum settlement charge of $ 53 million ($ 41 million after-tax or $ 0.03 per share). 88 Table of Contents The following table provides the weighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost and projected benefit obligation for our pension and retiree medical plans: Pension Retiree Medical U.S. International 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 2019 Net Periodic Benefit Cost Service cost discount rate 2.6 % 3.4 % 4.4 % 2.7 % 3.2 % 4.2 % 2.3 % 3.2 % 4.3 % Interest cost discount rate 2.0 % 2.9 % 4.1 % 1.7 % 2.4 % 3.2 % 1.6 % 2.6 % 3.8 % Expected return on plan assets 6.4 % 6.8 % 7.1 % 5.3 % 5.6 % 5.8 % 5.4 % 5.8 % 6.6 % Rate of salary increases 3.0 % 3.1 % 3.1 % 3.3 % 3.3 % 3.7 % Projected Benefit Obligation Discount rate 2.9 % 2.5 % 3.3 % 2.4 % 2.0 % 2.5 % 2.7 % 2.3 % 3.1 % Rate of salary increases 3.0 % 3.0 % 3.1 % 3.3 % 3.3 % 3.3 % The following table provides selected information about plans with accumulated benefit obligation and total projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets: Pension Retiree Medical U.S. International 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 Selected information for plans with accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets (a) Obligation for service to date $ ( 1,499 ) $ ( 5,537 ) $ ( 127 ) $ ( 172 ) Fair value of plan assets $ 705 $ 4,156 $ 102 $ 123 Selected information for plans with projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets (a) Benefit obligation $ ( 1,709 ) $ ( 9,172 ) $ ( 286 ) $ ( 2,933 ) $ ( 954 ) $ ( 1,006 ) Fair value of plan assets $ 705 $ 7,088 $ 171 $ 2,696 $ 299 $ 315 (a) The decrease in U.S. pension plans with obligations in excess of plan assets primarily reflects employer contributions to Plan H. Of the total projected pension benefit obligation as of December 25, 2021, approximately $ 810 million relates to plans that we do not fund because the funding of such plans does not receive favorable tax treatment. Future Benefit Payments Our estimated future benefit payments are as follows: 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027 - 2031 Pension $ 1,110 $ 960 $ 960 $ 995 $ 1,030 $ 5,385 Retiree medical (a) $ 95 $ 90 $ 90 $ 85 $ 80 $ 355 (a) Expected future benefit payments for our retiree medical plans do not reflect any estimated subsidies expected to be received under the 2003 Medicare Act. Subsidies are expected to be approximately $ 1 million for each of the years from 2022 through 2026 and approximately $ 4 million in total for 2027 through 2031. These future benefit payments to beneficiaries include payments from both funded and unfunded plans. 89 Table of Contents Funding Contributions to our pension and retiree medical plans were as follows: Pension Retiree Medical 2021 2020 2019 2021 2020 2019 Discretionary (a) $ 525 $ 339 $ 417 $ — $ — $ — Non-discretionary 213 168 255 47 55 44 Total $ 738 $ 507 $ 672 $ 47 $ 55 $ 44 (a) Includes $ 500 million contribution in 2021, $ 325 million contribution in 2020 and $ 400 million contribution in 2019 to fund our qualified defined benefit plans in the United States. We made a discretionary contribution of $ 75 million to our U.S. qualified defined benefit plans in January 2022 and expect to make an additional $ 75 million contribution in the third quarter of 2022. In addition, in 2022, we expect to make non-discretionary contributions of approximately $ 135 million to our U.S. and international pension benefit plans and approximately $ 55 million for retiree medical benefits. We continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related global economic conditions and uncertainty on the net unfunded status of our pension and retiree medical plans. We also regularly evaluate opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans. Plan Assets Our pension plan investment strategy includes the use of actively managed accounts and is reviewed periodically in conjunction with plan obligations, an evaluation of market conditions, tolerance for risk and cash requirements for benefit payments. This strategy is also applicable to funds held for the retiree medical plans. Our investment objective includes ensuring that funds are available to meet the plans’ benefit obligations when they become due. Assets contributed to our pension plans are no longer controlled by us, but become the property of our individual pension plans. However, we are indirectly impacted by changes in these plan assets as compared to changes in our projected obligations. Our overall investment policy is to prudently invest plan assets in a well-diversified portfolio of equity and high-quality debt securities and real estate to achieve our long-term return expectations. Our investment policy also permits the use of derivative instruments, such as futures and forward contracts, to reduce interest rate and foreign currency risks. Futures contracts represent commitments to purchase or sell securities at a future date and at a specified price. Forward contracts consist of currency forwards. For 2022 and 2021, our expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets is 6.3 % and 6.4 %, respectively. Our target investment allocations for U.S. plan assets are as follows: 2022 2021 Fixed income 56 % 51 % U.S. equity 22 % 24 % International equity 18 % 21 % Real estate 4 % 4 % Actual investment allocations may vary from our target investment allocations due to prevailing market conditions. We regularly review our actual investment allocations and periodically rebalance our investments. The expected return on plan assets is based on our investment strategy and our expectations for long-term rates of return by asset class, taking into account volatility and correlation among asset classes and our historical experience. We also review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of the long-term rates. We evaluate our expected return assumptions annually to ensure that they are reasonable. To calculate the expected return on plan assets, our market-related value of assets 90 Table of Contents for fixed income is the actual fair value. For all other asset categories, such as equity securities, we use a method that recognizes investment gains or losses (the difference between the expected and actual return based on the market-related value of assets) over a five-year period. This has the effect of reducing year-to-year volatility. Plan assets measured at fair value as of year-end 2021 and 2020 are categorized consistently by Level 1 (quoted prices in active markets for identical assets), Level 2 (significant other observable inputs) and Level 3 (significant unobservable inputs) in both years and are as follows: Fair Value Hierarchy Level 2021 2020 U.S. plan assets (a) Equity securities, including preferred stock (b) 1 $ 6,387 $ 7,179 Government securities (c) 2 2,523 2,177 Corporate bonds (c) 2 6,210 5,437 Mortgage-backed securities (c) 2 199 119 Contracts with insurance companies (d) 3 9 9 Cash and cash equivalents (e) 1, 2 352 278 Sub-total U.S. plan assets 15,680 15,199 Real estate commingled funds measured at net asset value (f) 478 517 Dividends and interest receivable, net of payables 45 64 Total U.S. plan assets $ 16,203 $ 15,780 International plan assets Equity securities (b) 1 $ 2,232 $ 2,119 Government securities (c) 2 1,053 937 Corporate bonds (c) 2 400 445 Fixed income commingled funds (g) 1 632 509 Contracts with insurance companies (d) 3 43 50 Cash and cash equivalents 1 34 33 Sub-total international plan assets 4,394 4,093 Real estate commingled funds measured at net asset value (f) 221 202 Dividends and interest receivable 9 8 Total international plan assets $ 4,624 $ 4,303 (a) Includes $ 299 million and $ 315 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, of retiree medical plan assets that are restricted for purposes of providing health benefits for U.S. retirees and their beneficiaries. (b) Invested in U.S. and international common stock and commingled funds, and the preferred stock portfolio was invested in domestic and international corporate preferred stock investments. The common and preferred stock investments are based on quoted prices in active markets. The commingled funds are based on the published price of the fund and include one large-cap fund that represents 11 % and 13 % of total U.S. plan assets for 2021 and 2020, respectively. (c) These investments are based on quoted bid prices for comparable securities in the marketplace and broker/dealer quotes in active markets. Corporate bonds of U.S.-based companies represent 32 % and 30 % of total U.S. plan assets for 2021 and 2020, respectively. (d) Based on the fair value of the contracts as determined by the insurance companies using inputs that are not observable. The changes in Level 3 amounts were not significant in the years ended December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020. (e) Includes Level 1 assets of $ 216 million and $ 178 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively, and Level 2 assets of $ 136 million and $ 100 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively. (f) The real estate commingled funds include investments in limited partnerships. These funds are based on the net asset value of the appraised value of investments owned by these funds as determined by independent third parties using inputs that are not observable. The majority of the funds are redeemable quarterly subject to availability of cash and have notice periods ranging from 45 to 90 days.

Savings Plan Certain U.S. employees are eligible to participate in a 401(k) savings plan, which is a voluntary defined contribution plan. The plan is designed to help employees accumulate savings for retirement and we make Company matching contributions for certain employees on a portion of employee contributions based on years of service. Certain U.S. salaried employees, who are not eligible to participate in a defined benefit pension plan, are also eligible to receive an employer contribution based on age and years of service regardless of employee contribution. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, our total Company contributions were $ 246 million, $ 225 million and $ 197 million, respectively.

(b) The interest rates presented reflect weighted-average effective interest rates at year-end. Certain of our fixed rate indebtedness have been swapped to floating rates through the use of interest rate derivative instruments. See Note 9 for further information regarding our interest rate derivative instruments. As of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, our international debt of $ 38 million and $ 29 million, respectively, was related to borrowings from external parties, including various lines of credit. These lines 92 Table of Contents of credit are subject to normal banking terms and conditions and are fully committed at least to the extent of our borrowings. In 2021, we issued the following senior notes: Interest Rate Maturity Date Amount (a) 0.750 % October 2033 € 1,000 1.950 % October 2031 $ 1,250 2.625 % October 2041 $ 750 2.750 % October 2051 $ 1,000 (a) Represents gross proceeds from issuances of long-term debt excluding debt issuance costs, discounts and premiums. The net proceeds from the issuances of the above notes will be used for general corporate purposes, including the repurchase of outstanding indebtedness and the repayment of commercial paper. In 2021, we paid $ 4.8 billion in cash in connection with the tender of certain notes redeemed in the following amounts: Interest Rate Maturity Date Principal Amount Tendered 5.500 % May 2035 $ 8 5.500 % May 2035 $ 1 (a) 5.500 % January 2040 $ 26 3.500 % March 2040 $ 443 4.875 % November 2040 $ 30 4.000 % March 2042 $ 261 3.600 % August 2042 $ 210 4.250 % October 2044 $ 190 4.600 % July 2045 $ 203 4.450 % April 2046 $ 532 3.450 % October 2046 $ 622 4.000 % May 2047 $ 212 3.375 % July 2049 $ 508 3.625 % March 2050 $ 611 3.875 % March 2060 $ 240 (a) Series A. As a result of the cash tender offers, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $ 842 million ($ 677 million after-tax or $ 0.49 per share) to net interest expense and other, primarily representing the tender price paid over the carrying value of the tendered notes and loss on treasury rate locks used to mitigate the interest rate risk on the cash tender offers. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for the mark-to-market impact of treasury rate locks associated with the cash tender offers. In 2021, we entered into a new five-year unsecured revolving credit agreement (Five-Year Credit Agreement), which expires on May 28, 2026. The Five-Year Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $ 3.75 billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros, including a $ 0.75 billion swing line subfacility for euro-denominated borrowings permitted to be borrowed on a same-day basis, subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $ 4.5 billion (or the equivalent amount in euros). Additionally, we may, once a year, 93 Table of Contents request renewal of the agreement for an additional one-year period. The Five-Year Credit Agreement replaced our $ 3.75 billion five year credit agreement, dated as of June 3, 2019. Also in 2021, we entered into a new 364-day unsecured revolving credit agreement (364-Day Credit Agreement), which expires on May 27, 2022. The 364-Day Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $ 3.75 billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros, subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $ 4.5 billion (or the equivalent amount in euros). We may request renewal of this facility for an additional 364-day period or convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year, which term loan would mature no later than the anniversary of the then effective termination date. The 364-Day Credit Agreement replaced our $ 3.75 billion 364-day credit agreement, dated as of June 1, 2020. Funds borrowed under the Five-Year Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. Subject to certain conditions, we may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts under these agreements. As of December 25, 2021, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Five-Year Credit Agreement or the 364-Day Credit Agreement. In 2020, one of our international consolidated subsidiaries borrowed 21.7 billion South African rand, or approximately $ 1.3 billion, from our two unsecured bridge loan facilities (Bridge Loan Facilities) to fund our acquisition of Pioneer Foods. These borrowings were fully repaid in April 2020 and no further borrowings under these Bridge Loan Facilities are permitted. In 2021, we paid $ 750 million to redeem all $ 750 million outstanding principal amount of our 1.70 % senior notes due 2021 and terminated the associated interest rate swap with a notional amount of $ 250 million. In 2020, we paid $ 1.1 billion to redeem all $ 1.1 billion outstanding principal amount of our 2.15 % senior notes due 2020 and terminated associated interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $ 0.8 billion. In 2019, we paid $ 1.0 billion to redeem all $ 1.0 billion outstanding principal amount of our 4.50 % senior notes due 2020. Note 9 — Financial Instruments Derivatives and Hedging We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in: • commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy; • foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and • interest rates. In the normal course of business, we manage commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of strategies, including productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs and hedging. Ongoing productivity initiatives involve the identification and effective implementation of meaningful cost-saving opportunities or efficiencies, including the use of derivatives. We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Our global purchasing programs include fixed-price contracts and purchase orders and pricing agreements. Our hedging strategies include the use of derivatives and, in the case of our net investment hedges, debt instruments. Certain derivatives are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment, while others do not qualify and are marked to market through earnings. The accounting for qualifying hedges allows changes in a hedging instrument’s fair value to offset corresponding changes in the hedged item in the same reporting period that the hedged item impacts earnings. Gains or losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other 94 Table of Contents comprehensive loss and reclassified to our income statement when the hedged transaction affects earnings. If it becomes probable that the hedged transaction will not occur, we immediately recognize the related hedging gains or losses in earnings; such gains or losses reclassified during the year ended December 25, 2021 were not material. Cash flows from derivatives used to manage commodity price, foreign exchange or interest rate risks are classified as operating activities in the cash flow statement. We classify both the earnings and cash flow impact from these derivatives consistent with the underlying hedged item. Credit Risk We perform assessments of our counterparty credit risk regularly, including reviewing netting agreements, if any, and a review of credit ratings, credit default swap rates and potential nonperformance of the counterparty. Based on our most recent assessment of our counterparty credit risk, we consider this risk to be low. In addition, we enter into derivative contracts with a variety of financial institutions that we believe are creditworthy in order to reduce our concentration of credit risk. Certain of our agreements with our counterparties require us to post full collateral on derivative instruments in a net liability position if our credit rating is at A2 (Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.) or A (S&P Global Ratings) and we have been placed on credit watch for possible downgrade or if our credit rating falls below either of these levels. The fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position as of December 25, 2021 was $ 247 million. We have posted no collateral under these contracts and no credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered as of December 25, 2021. Commodity Prices We are subject to commodity price risk because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited in the competitive environment in which we operate. This risk is managed through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, which primarily include swaps and futures. In addition, risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. We use derivatives, with terms of no more than three years , to hedge price fluctuations related to a portion of our anticipated commodity purchases, primarily for agricultural products, energy and metals. Derivatives used to hedge commodity price risk that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Our commodity derivatives had a total notional value of $ 1.6 billion as of December 25, 2021 and $ 1.1 billion as of December 26, 2020. Foreign Exchange We are exposed to foreign exchange risks in the international markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. Additionally, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency purchases and foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. We manage this risk through sourcing purchases from local suppliers, negotiating contracts in local currencies with foreign suppliers and through the use of derivatives, primarily forward contracts with terms of no more than two years . Exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions are recognized as transaction gains or losses on our income statement as incurred. We also use net investment hedges to partially offset the effects of foreign currency on our investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries. 95 Table of Contents Our foreign currency derivatives had a total notional value of $ 2.8 billion as of December 25, 2021 and $ 1.9 billion as of December 26, 2020. The total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was $ 2.1 billion as of December 25, 2021 and $ 2.7 billion as of December 26, 2020. For foreign currency derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, gains and losses were offset by changes in the underlying hedged items, resulting in no material net impact on earnings. Interest Rates We centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks, tax consequences and overall financing strategies. We use various interest rate derivative instruments including, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps, Treasury locks and swap locks to manage our overall interest expense and foreign exchange risk. These instruments effectively change the interest rate and currency of specific debt issuances. Certain of our fixed rate indebtedness have been swapped to floating rates. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt. Our cross-currency interest rate swaps have terms of no more than twelve years . Our Treasury locks and swap locks are entered into to protect against unfavorable interest rate changes relating to forecasted debt transactions. Our interest rate derivatives had a total notional value of $ 2.1 billion as of December 25, 2021 and $ 3.0 billion as of December 26, 2020. As of December 25, 2021, approximately 2 % of total debt was subject to variable rates, compared to approximately 3 %, after the impact of the related interest rate derivative instruments, as of December 26, 2020. Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities Investments in debt securities that we have the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity. Highly liquid debt securities with original maturities of three months or less are recorded as cash equivalents. Our held-to-maturity debt securities consist of U.S. Treasury securities and commercial paper. As of December 25, 2021, we had no investments in U.S. Treasury securities. As of December 26, 2020, we had $ 2.1 billion of investments in U.S. Treasury securities with $ 2.0 billion recorded in cash and cash equivalents and $ 0.1 billion in short-term investments. As of December 25, 2021, we had $ 130 million of investments in commercial paper recorded in cash and cash equivalents. As of December 26, 2020, we had $ 260 million of investments in commercial paper with $ 75 million recorded in cash and cash equivalents and $ 185 million in short-term investments. Held-to-maturity debt securities are recorded at amortized cost, which approximates fair value, and realized gains or losses are reported in earnings. Our investments mature in less than one year. As of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, gross unrecognized gains and losses and the allowance for expected credit losses were not material. 96 Table of Contents Fair Value Measurements The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities as of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020 are categorized as follows: 2021 2020 Fair Value Hierarchy Levels (a) Assets (a) Liabilities (a) Assets (a) Liabilities (a) Index funds (b) 1 $ 337 $ — $ 231 $ — Prepaid forward contracts (c) 2 $ 21 $ — $ 18 $ — Deferred compensation (d) 2 $ — $ 505 $ — $ 477 Contingent consideration (e) 3 $ — $ — $ — $ 861 Derivatives designated as fair value hedging instruments: Interest rate (f) 2 $ — $ — $ 2 $ — Derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments: Foreign exchange (g) 2 $ 29 $ 14 $ 9 $ 71 Interest rate (g) 2 14 264 13 307 Commodity (h) 2 70 5 32 — $ 113 $ 283 $ 54 $ 378 Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Foreign exchange (g) 2 $ 19 $ 7 $ 4 $ 8 Commodity (h) 2 35 22 19 7 $ 54 $ 29 $ 23 $ 15 Total derivatives at fair value (i) $ 167 $ 312 $ 79 $ 393 Total $ 525 $ 817 $ 328 $ 1,731 (a) Fair value hierarchy levels are defined in Note 7. Unless otherwise noted, financial assets are classified on our balance sheet within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets. Financial liabilities are classified on our balance sheet within accounts payable and other current liabilities and other liabilities. (b) Based on the price of index funds. These investments are classified as short-term investments and are used to manage a portion of market risk arising from our deferred compensation liability. (c) Based primarily on the price of our common stock. (d) Based on the fair value of investments corresponding to employees’ investment elections. (e) In connection with our acquisition of Rockstar, we recorded a liability for tax-related contingent consideration payable over up to 15 years, with an option to accelerate all remaining payments, with estimated maximum payments of approximately $ 1.1 billion, using current tax rates. The fair value of the liability is estimated using probability-weighted, discounted future cash flows at current tax rates. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we exercised our option to accelerate all remaining payments. The change in the contingent consideration in 2021 is comprised of the fourth quarter payment of $ 773 million, a recognized pre-tax gain of $ 86 million ($ 66 million after-tax or $ 0.05 per share), recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, and a fair value decrease of $ 2 million, recorded in goodwill as a result of the finalization of purchase price allocation. (f) Based on London Interbank Offered Rate forward rates. As of December 25, 2021, we had no hedged fixed-rate debt. As of December 26, 2020, the carrying amount of hedged fixed-rate debt was $ 0.2 billion and classified on our balance sheet within short-term debt obligations. As of December 25, 2021, there were no fair value hedging adjustments to hedged fixed-rate debt. As of December 26, 2020, the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments to hedged fixed-rate debt was a $ 2 million gain. As of December 25, 2021, the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments on discontinued hedges was a $ 2 million net loss, which is being amortized over the remaining life of the related debt obligations. (g) Based on recently reported market transactions of spot and forward rates. (h) Primarily based on recently reported market transactions of swap arrangements. (i) Derivative assets and liabilities are presented on a gross basis on our balance sheet. Amounts subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements which are not offset on the balance sheet as of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020 were not material. Collateral received or posted against our asset or liability positions was not material. Exchange-traded commodity futures are cash-settled on a daily basis and, therefore, not included in the table as of December 25, 2021. 97 Table of Contents The carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments recorded at amortized cost approximate fair value (classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy) due to their short-term maturity. The fair value of our debt obligations as of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020 was $ 43 billion and $ 50 billion, respectively, based upon prices of similar instruments in the marketplace, which are considered Level 2 inputs. Losses/(gains) on our hedging instruments are categorized as follows: Fair Value/Non- designated Hedges Cash Flow and Net Investment Hedges Losses/(Gains) Recognized in Income Statement (a) Losses/(Gains) Recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Losses/(Gains) Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss into Income Statement (b) 2021 2020 2021 2020 2021 2020 Foreign exchange $ ( 4 ) $ — $ ( 7 ) $ ( 9 ) $ 82 $ ( 43 ) Interest 56 ( 6 ) 44 ( 96 ) 64 ( 129 ) Commodity ( 218 ) 53 ( 285 ) ( 21 ) ( 194 ) 56 Net investment — — ( 192 ) 235 — — Total $ ( 166 ) $ 47 $ ( 440 ) $ 109 $ ( 48 ) $ ( 116 ) (a) Foreign exchange derivative losses/gains are primarily included in selling, general and administrative expenses.

See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Commodity derivative losses/gains are included in either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. (b) Foreign exchange derivative losses/gains are primarily included in cost of sales. Interest rate derivative losses/gains on cross-currency interest rate swaps are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Commodity derivative losses/gains are included in either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. Based on current market conditions, we expect to reclassify net gains of $ 176 million related to our cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net income during the next 12 months. 98 Table of Contents Note 10 — Net Income Attributable to PepsiCo per Common Share The computations of basic and diluted net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share are as follows: 2021 2020 2019 Income Shares (a) Income Shares (a) Income Shares (a) Basic net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share $ 5.51 $ 5.14 $ 5.23 Net income available for PepsiCo common shareholders $ 7,618 1,382 $ 7,120 1,385 $ 7,314 1,399 Dilutive securities: Stock options, RSUs, PSUs and other (b) — 7 — 7 — 8 Diluted $ 7,618 1,389 $ 7,120 1,392 $ 7,314 1,407 Diluted net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share $ 5.49 $ 5.12 $ 5.20 (a) Weighted-average common shares outstanding (in millions).

We have operating leases for plants, warehouses, distribution centers, storage facilities, offices and other facilities, as well as machinery and equipment, including fleet. Our leases generally have remaining lease terms of up to 20 years, some of which include options to extend the lease term for up to five years and some of which include options to terminate the lease within one year . We consider these options in determining the lease term used to establish our right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. We have lease agreements that contain both lease and non-lease components. For real estate leases, we account for lease components together with non-lease components (e.g., common-area maintenance). 101 Table of Contents Components of lease cost are as follows: 2021 2020 2019 Operating lease cost (a) $ 563 $ 539 $ 474 Variable lease cost (b) $ 112 $ 111 $ 101 Short-term lease cost (c) $ 469 $ 436 $ 379 (a) Includes right-of-use asset amortization of $ 505 million, $ 478 million, and $ 412 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. (b) Primarily related to adjustments for inflation, common-area maintenance and property tax. (c) Not recorded on our balance sheet. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recognized gains of $ 42 million, $ 7 million and $ 77 million, respectively, on sale-leaseback transactions with terms under five years. Supplemental cash flow information and non-cash activity related to our operating leases are as follows: 2021 2020 2019 Operating cash flow information: Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities $ 567 $ 555 $ 478 Non-cash activity: Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations $ 934 $ 621 $ 479 Supplemental balance sheet information related to our operating leases is as follows: Balance Sheet Classification 2021 2020 Right-of-use assets Other assets $ 2,020 $ 1,670 Current lease liabilities Accounts payable and other current liabilities $ 446 $ 460 Non-current lease liabilities Other liabilities $ 1,598 $ 1,233 Weighted-average remaining lease term and discount rate for our operating leases are as follows: 2021 2020 2019 Weighted-average remaining lease term 7 years 6 years 6 years Weighted-average discount rate 3 % 4 % 4 % Maturities of lease liabilities by year for our operating leases are as follows: 2022 $ 511 2023 402 2024 314 2025 245 2026 202 2027 and beyond 677 Total lease payments 2,351 Less: Imputed interest 307 Present value of lease liabilities $ 2,044 Lessor We have various arrangements for certain foodservice and vending equipment under which we are the lessor. These leases meet the criteria for operating lease classification. Lease income associated with these leases is not material. 102 Table of Contents Note 13 — Acquisitions and Divestitures 2020 Acquisitions On March 23, 2020, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Pioneer Foods, a food and beverage company in South Africa with exports to countries across the globe, for 110.00 South African rand per share in cash. The total consideration transferred was approximately $ 1.2 billion and was funded by two unsecured bridge loan facilities entered into by one of our international consolidated subsidiaries, which were fully repaid in April 2020. In connection with our acquisition of Pioneer Foods, we have made certain commitments to the South Africa Competition Commission, including a commitment to provide the equivalent of 8.8 billion South African rand, or approximately $ 0.5 billion as of the acquisition date, in value for the benefit of our employees, agricultural development, education, developing Pioneer Foods’ operations and enterprise development programs in South Africa. Included in this commitment is 2.3 billion South African rand, or approximately $ 0.1 billion, relating to the implementation of an employee ownership plan and an agricultural, entrepreneurship and educational development fund, which is an irrevocable condition of the acquisition. This commitment was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses primarily in the year ended December 26, 2020 and was primarily settled in the fourth quarter of 2021. The remaining commitment of 6.5 billion South African rand, or approximately $ 0.4 billion as of the acquisition date, relates to capital expenditures and/or business-related costs which will be incurred and recorded over a five-year period from the acquisition date. On April 24, 2020, we acquired Rockstar, an energy drink maker with whom we had a distribution agreement prior to the acquisition, for an upfront cash payment of approximately $ 3.85 billion and contingent consideration related to estimated future tax benefits associated with the acquisition of approximately $ 0.88 billion. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we exercised our option to accelerate all remaining payments due under the contingent consideration arrangement. See Note 9 for further information about the contingent consideration. On June 1, 2020, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Be & Cheery, one of the largest online convenient food companies in China, from Haoxiangni Health Food Co., Ltd. for cash. The total consideration transferred was approximately $ 0.7 billion. 103 Table of Contents We accounted for the 2020 transactions as business combinations. We recognized and measured the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the respective dates of acquisition. The purchase price allocations for each of the 2020 acquisitions were finalized in the second quarter of 2021. The fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisitions of Pioneer Foods, Rockstar and Be & Cheery and the resulting goodwill as of the respective acquisition dates is summarized as follows: Pioneer Foods Rockstar Be & Cheery Acquisition date March 23, 2020 April 24, 2020 June 1, 2020 Inventories $ 229 $ 52 $ 45 Property, plant and equipment 379 8 60 Amortizable intangible assets 52 — 98 Nonamortizable intangible assets 183 2,400 309 Other assets and liabilities ( 53 ) ( 9 ) ( 24 ) Net deferred income taxes ( 117 ) — ( 99 ) Noncontrolling interest ( 5 ) — — Total identifiable net assets 668 2,451 389 Goodwill 558 2,278 309 Total purchase price $ 1,226 $ 4,729 $ 698 Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets recognized. The goodwill recorded as part of the acquisition of Pioneer Foods primarily reflects synergies expected to arise from our combined brand portfolios and distribution networks, and is not deductible for tax purposes. All of the goodwill is recorded in the AMESA segment. The goodwill recorded as part of the acquisition of Rockstar primarily represents the value of PepsiCo’s expected new innovation in the energy category and is deductible for tax purposes. All of the goodwill is recorded in the PBNA segment. The goodwill recorded as part of the acquisition of Be & Cheery primarily reflects growth opportunities for PepsiCo as we leverage Be & Cheery’s direct-to-consumer and supply chain capabilities and is not deductible for tax purposes. All of the goodwill is recorded in the APAC segment. Juice Transaction In the first quarter of 2022, we sold our Tropicana, Naked and other select juice brands to PAI Partners for approximately $ 3.5 billion in cash and a 39 % noncontrolling interest in a newly formed joint venture that will operate across North America and Europe. The North America portion of the transaction was completed on January 24, 2022 and the Europe portion of the transaction was completed on February 1, 2022. In the U.S., PepsiCo acts as the exclusive distributor for the new joint venture’s portfolio of brands for small-format and foodservice customers with chilled direct-store-delivery. In connection with the sale, we entered into a transition services agreement with PAI Partners, under which we will provide certain services to the joint venture to help facilitate an orderly transition of the business following the sale. In return for these services, the new joint venture is required to pay certain agreed upon fees to reimburse us for our actual costs without markup. Subsequent to the transaction close date, the purchase price will be adjusted for net working capital and net debt amounts as of the transaction close date compared to targeted amounts set forth in the purchase agreement. We expect to record a pre-tax gain of approximately $ 3 billion in our PBNA and Europe segments in the first quarter of 2022 as a result of this transaction. We have reclassified $ 1.8 billion of assets, primarily accounts receivable, net, and inventories of $ 0.5 billion, goodwill and other intangible assets of $ 0.6 billion and property, plant and equipment of 104 Table of Contents $ 0.5 billion, and liabilities of $ 0.8 billion, primarily accounts payable and other liabilities of $ 0.6 billion and deferred income taxes of $ 0.2 billion, related to the Juice Transaction as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 25, 2021. The Juice Transaction does not meet the criteria to be classified as discontinued operations.

We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 25, 2021 and December 26, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 25, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 25, 2021 based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Basis for Opinions The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 108 Table of Contents Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Sales incentive accruals As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company offers sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. A number of the sales incentives are based on annual targets, resulting in the need to accrue for the expected liability. These incentives are accrued for in the “Accounts payable and other current liabilities” line on the balance sheet. These accruals are based on sales incentive agreements, expectations regarding customer and consumer participation and performance levels, and historical experience and trends. We identified the evaluation of certain of the Company’s sales incentive accruals as a critical audit matter. Subjective and complex auditor judgment is required in evaluating these sales incentive accruals as a result of the timing difference between when the product is delivered and when the incentive is settled. This specifically related to (1) forecasted customer and consumer participation and performance level assumptions underlying the accrual, and (2) the impact of historical experience and trends. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the sales incentive process, including controls related to (1) the accrual methodology, (2) assumptions around forecasted customer and consumer participation, (3) performance levels, and (4) monitoring of actual sales incentives incurred compared to estimated sales incentives in respect of historical periods. To evaluate the timing and amount of certain accrued sales incentives we (1) analyzed the accrual by sales incentive type as compared to historical trends to identify specific sales incentives that may require additional testing, (2) recalculated expenses and closing accruals on a sample basis, 109 Table of Contents based on volumes sold and terms of the sales incentives, (3) assessed the Company’s ability to accurately estimate its sales incentive accrual by comparing previously established accruals to actual settlements, and (4) tested a sample of settlements or claims that occurred after period end, and compared them to the recorded sales incentive accrual. Carrying value of certain reacquired and acquired franchise rights and certain juice and dairy brands As discussed in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company performs impairment testing of its indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis during the third quarter of each fiscal year and whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that there is a greater than 50% likelihood that the asset is impaired. The carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December 25, 2021 was $35.5 billion which represents 38% of total assets, and includes PepsiCo Beverages North America’s (PBNA) reacquired and acquired franchise rights which had a carrying value of $8.6 billion as of December 25, 2021. We identified the assessment of the carrying value of PBNA’s reacquired and acquired franchise rights and certain of Europe’s juice and dairy brands in Russia as a critical audit matter. Significant auditor judgment is necessary to assess the impact of competitive operating and macroeconomic factors on future levels of sales, operating profit and cash flows. The impairment analysis of these indefinite-lived intangible assets requires significant auditor judgment to evaluate the Company’s forecasted revenue and profitability levels, including the expected long-term growth rates and the selection of the discount rates to be applied to the projected cash flows. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the indefinite-lived assets impairment process, including controls related to the development of forecasted revenue, profitability levels, and expected long-term growth rates and select the discount rates to be applied to the projected cash flows. We also evaluated the sensitivity of the Company’s conclusion to changes in assumptions, including the assessment of changes in assumptions from prior periods. To assess the Company’s ability to accurately forecast, we compared the Company’s historical forecasted results to actual results. We compared the cash flow projections used in the impairment tests with available external industry data and other internal information. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in evaluating (1) the long-term growth rates used in the impairment tests by comparing against economic data and information specific to the respective assets, including projected long-term nominal Gross Domestic Product growth in the respective local countries, and (2) the discount rates used in the impairment tests by comparing them against discount rates that were independently developed using publicly available market data, including that of comparable companies. Unrecognized tax benefits As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s global operating model gives rise to income tax obligations in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions in which it operates. As of December 25, 2021, the Company recorded reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $1.9 billion. The Company establishes reserves if it believes that certain positions taken in its tax returns are subject to challenge and the Company likely will not succeed, even though the Company believes the tax return position is supportable under the tax law. The Company adjusts these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of new information, such as the progress of a tax examination, new tax law, relevant court rulings or tax authority settlements. We identified the evaluation of certain of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits as a critical audit matter because the application of tax law and interpretation of a tax authority’s settlement history is 110 Table of Contents complex and involves subjective judgment. Such judgments impact both the timing and amount of the reserves that are recognized, including judgments about re-measuring liabilities for positions taken in prior years’ tax returns in light of new information. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the unrecognized tax benefits process, including controls to (1) identify uncertain income tax positions, (2) evaluate the tax law and tax authority’s settlement history used to estimate the unrecognized tax benefits, and (3) monitor for new information that may give rise to changes to the existing unrecognized tax benefits, such as progress of a tax examination, new tax law or tax authority settlements. We involved tax and valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in assessing the unrecognized tax benefits by (1) evaluating the Company’s tax structure and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, and (2) assessing the Company’s interpretation of existing tax law as well as new and amended tax laws, tax positions taken, associated external counsel opinions, information from tax examinations, relevant court rulings and tax authority settlements. /s/ KPMG LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1990.

Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based upon criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 25, 2021. Attestation Report of the Registered Public Accounting Firm . KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, as part of their audit, has issued their report, included herein, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. (c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. During our fourth quarter of 2021, we continued migrating certain of our financial processing systems to an ERP solution. These systems implementations are part of our ongoing global business transformation initiative, and we plan to continue implementing such systems throughout other parts of our businesses in phases over the next several years. In connection with these ERP implementations, we are updating and will continue to update our internal control over financial reporting, as necessary, to accommodate modifications to our business processes and accounting procedures. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2021 and continuing into the first quarter of 2022, we began implementing these systems, resulting in changes that materially affected our internal control over financial reporting. These system implementations did not have an adverse effect, nor do we expect will have an adverse effect, on our internal control over financial reporting. In addition, in connection with our 2019 multi-year productivity plan, we continue to migrate to shared business models across our operations to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes. In connection with this 114 Table of Contents multi-year productivity plan and resulting business process changes, we continue to enhance the design and documentation of our internal control over financial reporting processes, to maintain effective controls over our financial reporting. These business process changes have not materially affected, and we do not expect them to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Except with respect to the continued implementation of ERP systems, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our fourth quarter of 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We will continue to assess the impact on our internal control over financial reporting as we continue to implement our ERP solution and our 2019 multi-year productivity plan. Item 9B.

COVID-19 The novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic in 2020 resulted in challenging operating environments and affected almost all of the more than 200 countries and territories in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, including as a result of travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, curfews, restrictions on public gatherings, shelter in place and safer-at-home orders, business shutdowns 4 Table of Contents and closures. We expect that the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our business operations, including our employees, customers, consumers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners, suppliers and other third parties with which we do business. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our future business operations and financial results remains uncertain and will continue to depend on numerous evolving factors outside our control. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Also, see “Our Business Risks” in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further information related to the impact of COVID-19 on our 2020 financial results. Our Distribution Network Our products are primarily brought to market through direct-store-delivery (DSD), customer warehouse and distributor networks and are also sold directly to consumers through e-commerce platforms and retailers. The distribution system used depends on customer needs, product characteristics and local trade practices. Direct-Store-Delivery We, our independent bottlers and our distributors operate DSD systems that deliver beverages, foods and snacks directly to retail stores where the products are merchandised by our employees or our independent bottlers. DSD enables us to merchandise with maximum visibility and appeal. DSD is especially well-suited to products that are restocked often and respond to in-store promotion and merchandising. Customer Warehouse Some of our products are delivered from our manufacturing plants and distribution centers, both company and third-party operated, to customer warehouses. These less costly systems generally work best for products that are less fragile and perishable, and have lower turnover. Distributor Networks We distribute many of our products through third-party distributors. Third-party distributors are particularly effective when greater distribution reach can be achieved by including a wide range of products on the delivery vehicles. For example, our foodservice and vending business distributes beverages, foods and snacks to restaurants, businesses, schools and stadiums through third-party foodservice and vending distributors and operators. E-commerce Our products are also available and sold directly to consumers on a growing number of company-owned and third-party e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications. Ingredients and Other Supplies The principal ingredients we use in our beverage, food and snack products are apple, orange and pineapple juice and other juice concentrates, aspartame, corn, corn sweeteners, flavorings, flour, grapefruit, oranges and other fruits, oats, potatoes, raw milk, rice, seasonings, sucralose, sugar, vegetable and essential oils, and wheat. We also use water in the manufacturing of our products. Our key packaging materials include plastic resins, including polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene resins used for plastic beverage bottles and film packaging used for snack foods, aluminum, glass, closures, cardboard and paperboard cartons. In addition, we continue to integrate recyclability into our product development process and support the increased use of recycled content, including recycled PET, in our packaging. Fuel, electricity and natural gas are also important commodities for our businesses due to their use in our and our business partners’ facilities and the vehicles delivering our products. We employ specialists to secure 5 Table of Contents adequate supplies of many of these items and have not experienced any significant continuous shortages that would prevent us from meeting our requirements. Many of these ingredients, raw materials and commodities are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and futures. In addition, risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. When prices increase, we may or may not pass on such increases to our customers. In addition, we continue to make investments to improve the sustainability and resources of our agricultural supply chain, including the development of our initiative to advance sustainable farming practices by our suppliers and expanding it further globally. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on how we manage our exposure to commodity prices. We also maintain voluntary supply chain finance agreements with several participating global financial institutions, pursuant to which our suppliers, at their sole discretion, may elect to sell their accounts receivable with PepsiCo to such global financial institutions. These agreements have not had a material impact on our business or financial results. See “Our Financial Results – Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further information.

We also hold long-term licenses to use valuable trademarks in connection with our products in certain markets, including Dole and Ocean Spray. We also distribute Bang Energy drinks and various Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. brands, including Dr Pepper in certain markets, Crush and Schweppes. Joint ventures in which we have an ownership interest either own or have the right to use certain trademarks, such as Lipton, Sabra and Starbucks. Trademarks remain valid so long as they are used properly for identification purposes, and we emphasize correct use of our trademarks. We have authorized, through licensing arrangements, the use of many of our trademarks in such contexts as snack food joint ventures and beverage bottling appointments. In addition, we license the use of our trademarks on merchandise that is sold at retail, which enhances brand awareness. We either own or have licenses to use a number of patents which relate to certain of our products, their packaging, the processes for their production and the design and operation of various equipment used in our businesses. Some of these patents are licensed to others. 6 Table of Contents Seasonality Our businesses are affected by seasonal variations. Our beverage, food and snack sales are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related patterns and generally lowest in the first quarter. However, taken as a whole, seasonality has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial results. Our Customers Our customers include wholesale and other distributors, foodservice customers, grocery stores, drug stores, convenience stores, discount/dollar stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, hard discounters, e-commerce retailers and authorized independent bottlers, among others. We normally grant our independent bottlers exclusive contracts to sell and manufacture certain beverage products bearing our trademarks within a specific geographic area. These arrangements provide us with the right to charge our independent bottlers for concentrate, finished goods and Aquafina royalties and specify the manufacturing process required for product quality. We also grant distribution rights to our independent bottlers for certain beverage products bearing our trademarks for specified geographic areas. We rely on and provide financial incentives to our customers to assist in the distribution and promotion of our products to the consumer. For our independent distributors and retailers, these incentives include volume-based rebates, product placement fees, promotions and displays. For our independent bottlers, these incentives are referred to as bottler funding and are negotiated annually with each bottler to support a variety of trade and consumer programs, such as consumer incentives, advertising support, new product support, and vending and cooler equipment placement. Consumer incentives include pricing discounts and promotions, and other promotional offers. Advertising support is directed at advertising programs and supporting independent bottler media. New product support includes targeted consumer and retailer incentives and direct marketplace support, such as point-of-purchase materials, product placement fees, media and advertising. Vending and cooler equipment placement programs support the acquisition and placement of vending machines and cooler equipment. The nature and type of programs vary annually. Changes to the retail landscape, including increased consolidation of retail ownership, the rapid growth of sales through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription services and other direct-to-consumer businesses, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers, as well as the international expansion of hard discounters, and the current economic environment, including in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, continue to increase the importance of major customers. In 2020, sales to Walmart Inc. (Walmart) and its affiliates, including Sam’s Club (Sam’s), represented approximately 14% of our consolidated net revenue, with sales reported across all of our divisions, including concentrate sales to our independent bottlers, which were used in finished goods sold by them to Walmart. The loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on our FLNA, QFNA and PBNA divisions. See “Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements” in “Our Financial Results – Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further information on our independent bottlers. Our Competition Our beverage, food and snack products are in highly competitive categories and markets and compete against products of international beverage, food and snack companies that, like us, operate in multiple geographies, as well as regional, local and private label manufacturers and economy brands and other competitors, including smaller companies developing and selling micro brands directly to consumers through e-commerce platforms or through retailers focused on locally-sourced products. In many countries in which our products are sold, including the United States, The Coca-Cola Company is our primary beverage competitor. Other beverage, food and snack competitors include, but are not limited to, 7 Table of Contents Campbell Soup Company, Conagra Brands, Inc., Kellogg Company, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., The Kraft Heinz Company, Link Snacks, Inc., Mondelēz International, Inc., Monster Beverage Corporation, Nestlé S.A., Red Bull GmbH and Utz Brands, Inc. Many of our food and snack products hold significant leadership positions in the food and snack industry in the United States and worldwide. In 2020, we and The Coca-Cola Company represented approximately 22% and 20%, respectively, of the U.S. liquid refreshment beverage category by estimated retail sales in measured channels, according to Information Resources, Inc. However, The Coca-Cola Company has significant carbonated soft drink (CSD) share advantage in many markets outside the United States. Our beverage, food and snack products compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition and loyalty, taste, price, value, quality, product variety, innovation, distribution, advertising, marketing and promotional activity (including digital), packaging, convenience, service and the ability to anticipate and effectively respond to consumer preferences and trends, including increased consumer focus on health and wellness and the continued acceleration of e-commerce and other methods of distributing and purchasing products. Success in this competitive environment is dependent on effective promotion of existing products, effective introduction of new products and reformulations of existing products, increased efficiency in production techniques, effective incorporation of technology and digital tools across all areas of our business, the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns, marketing programs, product packaging and pricing, new vending and dispensing equipment and brand and trademark development and protection. We believe that the strength of our brands, innovation and marketing, coupled with the quality of our products and flexibility of our distribution network, allows us to compete effectively. Research and Development We engage in a variety of research and development activities and invest in innovation globally with the goal of meeting the needs of our customers and consumers and accelerating growth. These activities principally involve: innovations focused on creating consumer preferred products to grow and transform our portfolio through development of new technologies, ingredients, flavors and substrates; development and improvement of our manufacturing processes including reductions in cost and environmental footprint; implementing product improvements to our global portfolio that reduce added sugars, sodium or saturated fat; offering more products with functional ingredients and positive nutrition including whole grains, fruit, vegetables, dairy, protein, fiber, micronutrients and hydration; development of packaging technology and new package designs, including reducing the amount of plastic in our packaging and developing recyclable and sustainable packaging; development of marketing, merchandising and dispensing equipment; further expanding our beyond the bottle portfolio including innovation for our SodaStream business; investments in technology and digitalization including data analytics to enhance our consumer insights and research; continuing to strengthen our omnichannel capabilities, particularly in e-commerce; and efforts focused on reducing our impact on the environment including reducing water use in our operations and our agricultural practices. Our research centers are located around the world, including in Brazil, China, India, Ireland, Mexico, Russia, South Africa, the United Kingdom and the United States, and leverage consumer insights, food science and engineering to meet our strategy to continually innovate our portfolio of convenient foods and beverages. Regulatory Matters The conduct of our businesses, including the production, storage, distribution, sale, display, advertising, marketing, labeling, content, quality, safety, transportation, packaging, disposal, recycling and use of our products, as well as our employment and occupational health and safety practices and protection of personal information, are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States, as well as to laws and regulations administered by 8 Table of Contents government entities and agencies in the more than 200 other countries and territories in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. It is our policy to abide by the laws and regulations around the world that apply to our businesses. The U.S. laws and regulations that we are subject to include, but are not limited to: the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and various state laws governing food safety; the Food Safety Modernization Act; the Occupational Safety and Health Act and various state laws and regulations governing workplace health and safety; various federal, state and local environmental protection laws, as discussed below; the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act; the Federal Trade Commission Act; the Lanham Act; various federal and state laws and regulations governing competition and trade practices; various federal and state laws and regulations governing our employment practices, including those related to equal employment opportunity, such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Act and the National Labor Relations Act and those related to overtime compensation, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act; data privacy and personal data protection laws and regulations, including the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018; customs and foreign trade laws and regulations, including laws regarding the import or export of our products or ingredients used in our products and tariffs; laws regulating the sale of certain of our products in schools; laws regulating our supply chain, including the 2010 California Transparency in Supply Chains Act and laws relating to the payment of taxes. We are also required to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act. We are also subject to various state and local statutes and regulations, including state consumer protection laws such as Proposition 65 in California, which requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a substance listed by the State of California as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects, unless the amount of such substance in the product is below a safe harbor level. We are subject to numerous similar and other laws and regulations outside the United States, including but not limited to laws and regulations governing food safety, international trade and tariffs, supply chain, including the U.K. Modern Slavery Act, occupational health and safety, competition, anti-corruption and data privacy, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. In many jurisdictions, compliance with competition laws is of special importance to us due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions, as is compliance with anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act. We rely on legal and operational compliance programs, as well as in-house and outside counsel and other experts, to guide our businesses in complying with the laws and regulations around the world that apply to our businesses. In addition, certain jurisdictions have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or commodities used in the production of our products. These taxes vary in scope and form: some apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). Similarly, some measures apply a single tax rate per ounce/liter on beverages containing over a certain level of added sugar (or other sweetener) while others apply a graduated tax rate depending upon the amount of added sugar (or other sweetener) in the beverage and some apply a flat tax rate on beverages containing a particular substance or ingredient, regardless of the level of such substance or ingredient. In addition, certain jurisdictions have either imposed, or are considering imposing, product labeling or warning requirements or other limitations on the marketing or sale of certain of our products as a result of ingredients or substances contained in such products or the audience to whom products are marketed. These types of provisions have required that we highlight perceived concerns about a product, warn consumers to avoid consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in our products, restrict the age of consumers to whom products are marketed or sold or limit the location in which our products may be available. It is possible that similar or more restrictive requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future. 9 Table of Contents In addition, certain jurisdictions have either imposed or are considering imposing regulations designed to increase recycling rates or encourage waste reduction. These regulations vary in scope and form from deposit return systems designed to incentivize the return of beverage containers, to extended producer responsibility policies and even bans on the use of some types of single-use plastics. It is possible that similar or more restrictive requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future. We are also subject to national and local environmental laws in the United States and in foreign countries in which we do business, including laws related to water consumption and treatment, wastewater discharge and air emissions. In the United States, our facilities must comply with the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other federal and state laws regarding handling, storage, release and disposal of wastes generated onsite and sent to third-party owned and operated offsite licensed facilities and our facilities outside the United States must comply with similar laws and regulations. In addition, continuing concern over climate change may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements (in or outside of the United States) to reduce or mitigate the potential effects of greenhouse gases, or to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity concerns. Our policy is to abide by all applicable environmental laws and regulations, and we have internal programs in place with respect to our global environmental compliance. We have made, and plan to continue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. While these expenditures have not had a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations to date, changes in environmental compliance requirements, and any expenditures necessary to comply with such requirements, could adversely affect our financial performance. In addition, we and our subsidiaries are subject to environmental remediation obligations arising in the normal course of business, as well as remediation and related indemnification obligations in connection with certain historical activities and contractual obligations, including those of businesses acquired by us or our subsidiaries. While these environmental remediation and indemnification obligations cannot be predicted with certainty, such obligations have not had, and are not expected to have, a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. In addition to the discussion in this section, see also “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Human Capital PepsiCo believes that human capital management, including attracting, developing and retaining a high quality workforce, is critical to our long-term success. Our Board and its Committees provide oversight on a broad range of human capital management topics, including corporate culture, diversity and inclusion, pay equity, health and safety, training and development and compensation and benefits. We employed approximately 291,000 people worldwide as of December 26, 2020, including approximately 120,000 people within the United States. We are party to numerous collective bargaining agreements and believe that relations with our employees are generally good. Protecting the safety, health, and well-being of our associates around the world is PepsiCo’s top priority. We strive to achieve an injury-free work environment. We also continue to invest in emerging technologies to protect our employees from injuries, including leveraging fleet telematics and distracted driving technology, resulting in reductions in road traffic accidents, and deploying wearable ergonomic risk reduction devices. In addition, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have remained focused on the health and safety of our associates, especially our frontline associates who continue to make, move and sell our products during this critical time, including by implementing new safety protocols in our facilities, providing personal protective equipment and enabling testing. We believe that our culture of diversity and inclusion is a competitive advantage that fuels innovation, enhances our ability to attract and retain talent and strengthens our reputation. We continually strive to 10 Table of Contents improve the attraction, retention, and advancement of diverse associates to ensure we sustain a high-caliber pipeline of talent that also represents the communities we serve. As of December 26, 2020, our global workforce was approximately 25% female, while management roles were approximately 41% female. As of December 26, 2020, approximately 43% of our U.S. workforce was comprised of racially/ethnically diverse individuals, of which approximately 30% of our U.S. associates in managerial roles were racially/ethnically diverse individuals. Direct reports of our Chief Executive Officer include 7 executives globally who are racially/ethnically diverse and/or female. We are also committed to the continued growth and development of our associates. PepsiCo supports and develops its associates through a variety of global training and development programs that build and strengthen employees' leadership and professional skills, including career development plans, mentoring programs and in-house learning opportunities, such as PEP U Degreed, our internal global online learning resource. In 2020, PepsiCo employees completed over 875,000 hours of training.

The following risks, some of which have occurred and any of which may occur in the future, can have a material adverse effect on our business or financial performance, which in turn can affect the price of our publicly traded securities. These are not the only risks we face. There may be other risks we are not currently aware of or that we currently deem not to be material but may become material in the future. COVID-19 Risks The impact of COVID-19 continues to create considerable uncertainty for our business. Our global operations continue to expose us to risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. Authorities around the world have implemented numerous measures to try to reduce the spread of the virus and such measures have impacted and continue to impact us, our business partners and consumers. While some of these measures have been lifted or eased in certain jurisdictions, other jurisdictions have seen a resurgence of COVID-19 cases resulting in reinstitution or expansion of such measures. 11 Table of Contents We have seen and could continue to see changes in consumer demand as a result of COVID-19, including the inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine or other restrictions, store closures, or financial hardship. We also continue to see shifts in product and channel prefe rences, particularly an increase in demand in the e-commerce channel, which has impacted and could continue to impact our sales and profitability. Reduced demand for our products or changes in consumer purchasing patterns, as well as continued economic uncertainty, can adversely affect our customers’ financial condition, which can result in bankruptcy filings and/or an inability to pay for our products. In addition, we may also continue to experience business disruptions as a result of COVID-19, resulting from temporary closures of our facilities or facilities of our business partners or the inability of a significant portion of our or our business partners’ workforce to work because of illness, quarantine, or travel or other governmental restrictions. Any sustained interruption in our or our business partners’ operations, distribution network or supply chain or any significant continuous shortage of raw materials or other supplies, including personal protective equipment or sanitization products, can negatively impact our business. We have also incurred, and expect to continue to incur, increased employee and operating costs as a result of COVID-19, such as costs related to expanded benefits and frontline incentives, the provision of personal protective equipment and increased sanitation, allowances for credit losses, upfront payment reserves and inventory write-offs, which have negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact our profitability. In addition, the increase in certain of our employees working remotely has resulted in increased demand on our information technology infrastructure, which can be subject to failure, disruption or unavailability, and increased vulnerability to cyberattacks and other cyber incidents. Also, continued economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in volatility in the global capital and credit markets which can impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. The impact of COVID-19 has heightened, or in some cases manifested, certain of the other risks discussed herein. The extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business remains uncertain and will continue to depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict and which will vary by jurisdiction and market, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, global economic conditions during and after the pandemic, governmental actions that have been taken, or may be taken in the future, in response to the pandemic, and changes in consumer behavior in response to the pandemic, some of which may be more than just temporary. Business Risks Reduction in future demand for our products would adversely affect our business. Demand for our products depends in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively respond to shifts in consumer trends and preferences, including the types of products our consumers want and how they browse for, purchase and consume them. Consumer preferences continuously evolve due to a variety of factors, including: changes in consumer demographics, consumption patterns and channel preferences (including continued rapid increases in the e-commerce and online-to-offline channels); pricing; product quality; concerns or perceptions regarding packaging and its environmental impact (such as single-use and other plastic packaging); and concerns or perceptions regarding the nutrition profile and health effects of, or location of origin of, ingredients or substances in our products. Concerns with any of the foregoing could lead consumers to reduce or publicly boycott the purchase or consumption of our products. Consumer preferences are also influenced by perception of our brand image or the brand images of our products, the success of our advertising and marketing campaigns, our ability to engage with our consumers in the manner they prefer, including through the use of digital media, and the perception of our use, and the use of social media. These and other factors have reduced in the past and could continue to reduce consumers’ willingness to purchase certain of our products. Any inability on our part to anticipate 12 Table of Contents or react to changes in consumer preferences and trends, or make the right strategic investments to do so, including investments in data analytics to understand consumer trends, can lead to reduced demand for our products, lead to inventory write-offs or erode our competitive and financial position, thereby adversely affecting our business. In addition, our business operations are subject to disruption by natural disasters or other events beyond our control that could negatively impact product availability and decrease demand for our products if our crisis management plans do not effectively resolve these issues. Damage to our reputation or brand image can adversely affect our business. Maintaining a positive reputation globally is critical to selling our products. Our reputation or brand image has in the past been, and could in the future be, adversely impacted by a variety of factors, including: any failure by us or our business partners to maintain high ethical, social, business and environmental practices, including with respect to human rights, child labor laws and workplace conditions and employee health and safety; any failure to achieve our sustainability goals, including with respect to the nutrition profile of our products, packaging, water use and our impact on the environment; any failure to address health concerns about our products or particular ingredients in our products, including concerns regarding whether certain of our products contribute to obesity; our research and development efforts; any product quality or safety issues, including the recall of any of our products; any failure to comply with laws and regulations; consumer perception of our advertising campaigns, sponsorship arrangements, marketing programs and use of social media; or any failure to effectively respond to negative or inaccurate comments about us on social media or otherwise regarding any of the foregoing. Damage to our reputation or brand image has in the past and could in the future decrease demand for our products, thereby adversely affecting our business. Issues or concerns with respect to product quality and safety can adversely affect our business. Product quality or safety issues, including alleged mislabeling, misbranding, spoilage, undeclared allergens, adulteration or contamination, whether as a result of failure to comply with food safety laws or otherwise, have in the past and could in the future reduce consumer confidence and demand for our products, cause production and delivery disruptions, require product recalls and result in increased costs (including payment of fines and/or judgments) and damage our reputation, all of which can adversely affect our business. Failure to maintain adequate oversight over product quality or safety can result in product recalls, litigation, government investigations or inquiries or civil or criminal proceedings, all of which may result in fines, penalties, damages or criminal liability. Our business can also be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in product quality, safety and integrity generally, even if such loss of confidence is unrelated to products in our portfolio. Any inability to compete effectively can adversely affect our business. Our products compete against products of international beverage, food and snack companies that, like us, operate in multiple geographies, as well as regional, local and private label and economy brand manufacturers and other competitors, including smaller companies developing and selling micro brands directly to consumers through e-commerce platforms or through retailers focused on locally sourced products. In many countries in which our products are sold, including the United States, The Coca-Cola Company is our primary beverage competitor. Our products compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition and loyalty, taste, price, value, quality, product variety, innovation, distribution, advertising, marketing and promotional activity, packaging, convenience, service and the ability to anticipate and effectively respond to consumer preferences and trends. Our business can be adversely affected if we are unable to effectively promote or develop our existing products or introduce new products, if our competitors spend more aggressively than we do or if we are otherwise unable to effectively respond to pricing pressure or compete effectively, and we may be unable to grow or maintain sales or category share or we may need to increase capital, marketing or other expenditures. 13 Table of Contents Failure to attract, develop and maintain a highly skilled and diverse workforce can have an adverse effect on our business. Our business requires that we attract, develop and maintain a highly skilled and diverse workforce. Our employees are highly sought after by our competitors and other companies and our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract, retain, develop and motivate highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Any unplanned turnover or unsuccessful implementation of our succession plans to backfill current leadership positions, including the Chief Executive Officer, or failure to attract, develop and maintain a highly skilled and diverse workforce, including with key capabilities such as e-commerce and digital marketing and data analytic skills, can deplete our institutional knowledge base, erode our competitive advantage or result in increased costs due to increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs. In addition, failure to attract, retain and develop associates from underrepresented communities can damage our business results and our reputation. Any of the foregoing can adversely affect our business. Water scarcity can adversely affect our business. We and our business partners use water in the manufacturing and sourcing of our products. Lack of available water of acceptable quality, increasing focus by governmental and non-governmental organizations, investors, customers and consumers on water scarcity and increasing pressure to conserve and replenish water in areas of scarcity and stress may lead to: supply chain disruption; adverse effects on our operations or the operations of our business partners; higher compliance costs; capital expenditures (including investments in the development of technologies to enhance water efficiency and reduce consumption); higher production costs, including less favorable pricing for water; the interruption or cessation of operations at, or relocation of, our facilities or the facilities of our business partners; failure to achieve our sustainability goals relating to water use; perception of our failure to act responsibly with respect to water use or to effectively respond to legal or regulatory requirements concerning water scarcity; or damage to our reputation, any of which can adversely affect our business. Changes in the retail landscape or in sales to any key customer can adversely affect our business. The retail landscape continues to evolve, including rapid growth in e-commerce channels and hard discounters. Our business will be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain and develop successful relationships with e-commerce retailers and hard discounters, while also maintaining relationships with our key customers operating in traditional retail channels (many of whom are also focused on increasing their e-commerce sales). Our business can be adversely affected if e-commerce channels and hard discounters take significant additional market share away from traditional retailers or we fail to find ways to create more powerful digital tools and capabilities for our retail customers to enable them to grow their businesses. In addition, our business can be adversely affected if we are unable to profitably expand our own direct-to-consumer e-commerce capabilities. The retail industry is also impacted by increased consolidation of ownership and purchasing power, particularly in North America, Europe and Latin America, resulting in large retailers or buying groups with increased purchasing power, impacting our ability to compete in these areas. Consolidation also adversely impacts our smaller customers’ ability to compete effectively, resulting in an inability on their part to pay for our products or reduced or canceled orders of our products. Further, we must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers, including Walmart, to compete effectively. Any inability to resolve a significant dispute with any of our key customers, a change in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of any of our key customers, even if unrelated to us, a significant reduction in sales to any key customer, or the loss of any of our key customers can adversely affect our business. 14 Table of Contents Disruption of our supply chain may adversely affect our business. Many of the raw materials and supplies used in the production of our products are sourced from countries experiencing civil unrest, political instability or unfavorable economic conditions. Some raw materials and supplies, including packaging materials such as recycled PET, are available only from a limited number of suppliers or from a sole supplier or are in short supply when seasonal demand is at its peak. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain favorable arrangements and relationships with suppliers or that our contingency plans will be effective to prevent disruptions that may arise from shortages or discontinuation of any raw materials and other supplies that we use in the manufacture, production and distribution of our products. The raw materials and other supplies, including agricultural commodities and fuel, that we use for the manufacturing, production and distribution of our products are subject to price volatility and fluctuations in availability caused by many factors, including changes in supply and demand, weather conditions (including potential effects of climate change), fire, natural disasters, disease or pests (including the impact of greening disease on the citrus industry), agricultural uncertainty, health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks, governmental incentives and controls (including import/export restrictions, such as new or increased tariffs, sanctions, quotas or trade barriers), political uncertainties, acts of terrorism, governmental instability or currency exchange rates. Many of our raw materials and supplies are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation. If price changes result in unexpected or significant increases in the costs of any raw materials or other supplies, we may be unwilling or unable to increase our product prices or unable to effectively hedge against price increases to offset these increased costs without suffering reduced volume, revenue, margins and operating results. Political and social conditions can adversely affect our business. Political and social conditions in the markets in which our products are sold have been and could continue to be difficult to predict, resulting in adverse effects on our business. The results of elections, referendums or other political conditions (including government shutdowns) in these markets, including the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union, have in the past and could continue to impact how existing laws, regulations and government programs or policies are implemented or result in uncertainty as to how such laws, regulations, programs or policies may change, including with respect to tariffs, sanctions, environmental and climate change regulations, taxes, benefit programs, the movement of goods, services and people between countries, relationships between countries, customer or consumer perception of a particular country or its government and other matters, and has resulted in and could continue to result in exchange rate fluctuation, volatility in global stock markets and global economic uncertainty or adversely affect demand for our products, any of which can adversely affect our business. In addition, political and social conditions in certain cities throughout the U.S. as well as globally have resulted in demonstrations and protests, including in connection with political elections and civil rights and liberties. Our operations, including the distribution of our products and the ingredients or other raw materials used in the production of our products, may be disrupted if such events persist for a prolonged period of time, including due to actions taken by governmental authorities in affected cities and regions, which can adversely affect our business. Our business can be adversely affected if we are unable to grow in developing and emerging markets. Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business in developing and emerging markets, including Mexico, Russia, the Middle East, Brazil, China, South Africa and India. There can be no assurance that our products will be accepted or be successful in any particular developing or emerging market, due to competition, price, cultural differences, consumer preferences, method of distribution or otherwise. Our business in these markets has been and could continue in the future to be impacted by economic, political and social conditions; acts of war, terrorist acts, and civil unrest, including demonstrations and protests; competition; tariffs, sanctions or other regulations restricting contact with 15 Table of Contents certain countries in these markets; foreign ownership restrictions; nationalization of our assets or the assets of our business partners; government-mandated closure, or threatened closure, of our operations or the operations of our business partners; restrictions on the import or export of our products or ingredients or substances used in our products; highly inflationary economies; devaluation or fluctuation or demonetization of currency; regulations on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, currency controls or other currency exchange restrictions, which result in significant cash balances in foreign countries, from time to time, or can significantly affect our ability to effectively manage our operations in certain of these markets and can result in the deconsolidation of such businesses; the lack of well-established or reliable legal systems; increased costs of doing business due to compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act; and adverse consequences, such as the assessment of fines or penalties, for any failure to comply with laws and regulations. Our business can be adversely affected if we are unable to expand our business in developing and emerging markets, effectively operate, or manage the risks associated with operating, in these markets, or achieve the return on capital we expect from our investments in these markets. Changes in economic conditions can adversely impact our business. Many of the jurisdictions in which our products are sold have experienced and could continue to experience uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions, such as recessions or economic slowdowns, which have and could continue to result in adverse changes in interest rates, tax laws or tax rates; volatile commodity markets; highly inflationary economies, devaluation, fluctuation or demonetization; contraction in the availability of credit; demonetization, austerity or stimulus measures; the effects of any default by or deterioration in the creditworthiness of the countries in which our products are sold; or a decrease in the fair value of pension or post-retirement assets that could increase future employee benefit costs and/or funding requirements of our pension or post-retirement plans. In addition, we cannot predict how current or future economic conditions will affect our business partners, including financial institutions with whom we do business, and any negative impact on any of the foregoing may also have an adverse impact on our business. Future cyber incidents and other disruptions to our information systems can adversely affect our business. We depend on information systems and technology, including public websites and cloud-based services, for many activities important to our business, including communications within our company, interfacing with customers and consumers; ordering and managing inventory; managing and operating our facilities; protecting confidential information; maintaining accurate financial records and complying with regulatory, financial reporting, legal and tax requirements. Our business has in the past and could in the future be negatively affected by system shutdowns, degraded systems performance, systems disruptions or security incidents. These disruptions or incidents may be caused by cyberattacks and other cyber incidents, network or power outages, software, equipment or telecommunications failures, the unintentional or malicious actions of employees or contractors, natural disasters, fires or other catastrophic events. Cyberattacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently, are constantly evolving in nature, are becoming more sophisticated and are being carried out by groups and individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives. Cyberattacks and cyber incidents take many forms including cyber extortion, denial of service, social engineering, introduction of viruses or malware, exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware, software or other infrastructure, hacking, website defacement or theft of passwords and other credentials, unauthorized use of computing resources for digital currency mining and business email compromise. As with other global companies, we are regularly subject to cyberattacks and other cyber incidents, including many of the types of attacks and incidents described above. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to continue to build and maintain our information technology infrastructure, or if 16 Table of Contents we fail to timely identify or appropriately respond to cyberattacks or other cyber incidents, our business can be adversely affected, resulting in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, data loss, legal claims or proceedings, regulatory penalties, and the loss of sales and customers. Similar risks exist with respect to third-party providers, including cloud-based service providers, that we rely upon for aspects of our information technology support services and administrative functions, including payroll processing, health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions, and the systems managed, hosted, provided and/or used by such third parties and their vendors. The need to coordinate with various third-party service providers, including with respect to timely notification and access to personnel and information concerning an incident, may complicate our efforts to resolve issues that arise. As a result, we are subject to the risk that the activities associated with our third-party service providers can adversely affect our business even if the attack or breach does not directly impact our systems or information. Although the cyber incidents and other systems disruptions that we have experienced to date have not had a material effect on our business, such incidents or disruptions could have a material adverse effect on us in the future. While we devote significant resources to network security, disaster recovery, employee training and other security measures to protect our systems and data, there are no assurances that such measures will protect us against all cyber incidents or systems disruptions. In addition, while we currently maintain insurance coverage that, subject to its terms and conditions, is intended to address costs associated with certain aspects of cyber incidents and information systems failures, this insurance coverage may not, depending on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding an incident, cover all losses or all types of claims that arise from an incident, or the damage to our reputation or brands that may result from an incident. Failure to successfully complete or manage strategic transactions can adversely affect our business. We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and evaluate potential acquisitions, joint ventures, distribution agreements, divestitures, refranchisings and other strategic transactions. The success of these transactions is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to realize the full extent of the expected returns, benefits, cost savings or synergies as a result of a transaction, within the anticipated time frame, or at all; receipt of necessary consents, clearances and approvals; and diversion of management’s attention from day-to-day operations. Risks associated with strategic transactions include integrating manufacturing, distribution, sales, accounting, financial reporting and administrative support activities and information technology systems with our company; operating through new business models or in new categories or territories; motivating, recruiting and retaining executives and key employees; conforming controls (including internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures) and policies (including with respect to environmental compliance, health and safety compliance and compliance with anti-bribery laws); retaining existing customers and consumers and attracting new customers and consumers; managing tax costs or inefficiencies; maintaining good relations with divested or refranchised businesses in our supply or sales chain; managing the impact of business decisions or other actions or omissions of our joint venture partners that may have different interests than we do; and other unanticipated problems or liabilities, such as contingent liabilities and litigation. Strategic transactions that are not successfully completed or managed effectively, or our failure to effectively manage the risks associated with such transactions, have in the past and could continue to result in adverse effects on our business. Our reliance on third-party service providers can have an adverse effect on our business. We rely on third-party service providers, including cloud data service providers, for certain areas of our business, including payroll processing, health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions. Failure by these third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory and other obligations to us, or our failure to adequately monitor their performance, has in the past and could 17 Table of Contents continue to result in our inability to achieve the expected cost savings or efficiencies and result in additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers. Depending on the function involved, such errors can also lead to business disruption, systems performance degradation, processing inefficiencies or other systems disruptions, the loss of or damage to intellectual property or sensitive data through security breaches or otherwise, incorrect or adverse effects on financial reporting, litigation or remediation costs, damage to our reputation or have a negative impact on employee morale, all of which can adversely affect our business. In addition, we continue on our multi-year business transformation initiative to migrate certain of our systems, including our financial processing systems, to enterprise-wide systems solutions. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper information technology infrastructure, or if we fail to achieve the expected benefits from this initiative, our business could be adversely affected. Climate change or measures to address climate change can negatively affect our business or damage our reputation. Climate change may have a negative effect on agricultural productivity which may result in decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as potatoes, sugar cane, corn, wheat, rice, oats, oranges and other fruits (and fruit-derived oils). In addition, climate change may also increase the frequency or severity of natural disasters and other extreme weather conditions, which could impair our production capabilities, disrupt our supply chain or impact demand for our products. Also, concern over climate change may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change, which could result in significant increased costs and require additional investments in facilities and equipment. As a result, the effects of climate change can negatively affect our business and operations. In addition, any failure to achieve our goals with respect to reducing our impact on the environment or perception of a failure to act responsibly with respect to the environment or to effectively respond to regulatory requirements concerning climate change can lead to adverse publicity, resulting in an adverse effect on our business or damage to our reputation. Strikes or work stoppages can cause our business to suffer. Many of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and other employees may seek to be covered by collective bargaining agreements. Strikes or work stoppages or other business interruptions can occur if we are unable to renew, or enter into new, collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms and can impair manufacturing and distribution of our products, lead to a loss of sales, increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully implement future operational changes to enhance our efficiency or to adapt to changing business needs or strategy, all of which can adversely affect our business. Financial Risks Failure to realize benefits from our productivity initiatives can adversely affect our financial performance. Our future growth depends, in part, on our ability to continue to reduce costs and improve efficiencies, including implementing shared business service organizational models. We continue to identify and implement productivity initiatives that we believe will position our business for long-term sustainable growth by allowing us to achieve a lower cost structure, improve decision-making and operate more efficiently. Some of these measures result in unintended consequences, such as business disruptions, distraction of management and employees, reduced morale and productivity, unexpected employee attrition, an inability to attract or retain key personnel and negative publicity. If we are unable to successfully implement our productivity initiatives as planned or do not achieve expected savings as a 18 Table of Contents result of these initiatives, we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits, resulting in adverse effects on our financial performance. A deterioration in our estimates and underlying assumptions regarding the future performance of our business can result in an impairment charge that can adversely affect our results of operations. We conduct impairment tests on our goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. In addition, amortizable intangible assets, property, plant and equipment and other long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. A deterioration in our underlying assumptions regarding the impact of competitive operating conditions, macroeconomic conditions or other factors used to estimate the future performance of any of our reporting units or assets, including any deterioration in the weighted-average cost of capital based on market data available at the time, can result in an impairment, which can adversely affect our results of operations. Fluctuations in exchange rates impact our financial performance. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the United States, where the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar, are translated into U.S. dollars. Given our global operations, we also pay for the ingredients, raw materials and commodities used in our business in numerous currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates, including as a result of currency controls or other currency exchange restrictions have had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on our financial performance. Our borrowing costs and access to capital and credit markets can be adversely affected by a downgrade or potential downgrade of our credit ratings. Rating agencies routinely evaluate us and their ratings are based on a number of factors, including our cash generating capability, levels of indebtedness, policies with respect to shareholder distributions and our financial strength generally, as well as factors beyond our control, such as the state of the economy and our industry. We expect to maintain Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global credit markets at favorable interest rates. Any downgrade or announcement that we are under review for a potential downgrade of our credit ratings, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, can increase our future borrowing costs, impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all, result in a reduction in our liquidity, or impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically (and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing), all of which can adversely affect our financial performance. Legal, Tax and Regulatory Risks Taxes aimed at our products can adversely affect our business or financial performance. Certain jurisdictions in which our products are sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes on the manufacture, distribution or sale of certain of our products, particularly our beverages, as a result of the ingredients or substances contained in our products. These taxes vary in scope and form: some apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). Similarly, some measures apply a single tax rate per ounce/liter on beverages containing over a certain amount of added sugar (or other sweetener), some apply a graduated tax rate depending upon the amount of added sugar (or other sweetener) in the beverage and others apply a flat tax rate on beverages containing any amount of added sugar (or other sweetener). For example, Poland enacted a graduated tax on all sweetened beverages, effective January 1, 2021, at a rate of PLN 0.5 (USD 0.12) per liter for drinks with a sugar (or other sweetener) content of up to 5g per 100ml and an additional PLN 0.05 (USD 0.01) for each gram of sugar (or other sweetener) over 5g . These tax measures, whatever their scope or form, have in the past and could continue to increase the cost of certain 19 Table of Contents of our products, reduce overall consumption of our products or lead to negative publicity, resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial performance. Limitations on the marketing or sale of our products can adversely affect our business and financial performance. Certain jurisdictions in which our products are sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, limitations on the marketing or sale of our products as a result of ingredients or substances in our products. These limitations require that we highlight perceived concerns about a product, warn consumers to avoid consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in our products, restrict the age of consumers to whom products are marketed or sold or limit the location in which our products may be available. For example, Mexico has imposed a stop-sign labeling scheme to signal the presence of non-caloric sweeteners and caffeine in pre-packaged foods and non-alcoholic beverages. Certain jurisdictions have imposed or are considering imposing color-coded labeling requirements where colors such as red, yellow and green are used to indicate various levels of a particular ingredient, such as sugar, sodium or saturated fat, in products. The imposition or proposed imposition of additional limitations on the marketing or sale of our products has in the past and could continue to reduce overall consumption of our products, lead to negative publicity or leave consumers with the perception that our products do not meet their health and wellness needs, resulting in an adverse effect on our business and financial performance. Laws and regulations related to the use or disposal of plastics or other packaging can adversely affect our business and financial performance. Certain of our products are sold in plastic or other packaging designed to be recyclable. However, not all packaging is recycled, whether due to lack of infrastructure or otherwise, and certain of our packaging is not currently recyclable. Packaging waste that displays one or more of our brands has in the past resulted in and could continue to result in negative publicity or reduced consumer demand for our products, adversely affecting our financial performance. Many jurisdictions in which our products are sold have imposed or are considering imposing regulations or policies intended to encourage the use of sustainable packaging, waste reduction or increased recycling rates or to restrict the sale of products utilizing certain packaging. These regulations vary in form and scope and include taxes to incentivize behavior, restrictions on certain products and materials, requirements for bottle caps to be tethered to bottles, bans on the use of single-use plastics, extended producer responsibility policies and requirements to charge deposit fees. For example, the European Union has imposed a minimum recycled content requirement for beverage bottles packaging and similar legislation is under consideration in several states in the United States. These laws and regulations have in the past and could continue to increase the cost of our products, impact demand for our products, result in negative publicity and require us and our business partners, including our independent bottlers, to increase our capital expenditures to invest in minimizing the amount of plastic or other materials used in our packaging or to develop alternative packaging, all of which can adversely affect our business and financial performance. Failure to comply with personal data protection and privacy laws can adversely affect our business. We are subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in numerous jurisdictions regarding personal data protection and privacy laws. These laws and regulations may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country or, within the United States, from state to state, and can create inconsistent or conflicting requirements. Our efforts to comply with these laws and regulations, including with respect to data from residents of the European Union who are covered by the General Data Protection Regulation or residents of the state of California who are covered by the California Consumer Privacy Act, impose significant costs and challenges that are likely to continue to increase over time. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can result in litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations or damage to our reputation, all of which can adversely affect our business. 20 Table of Contents Increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or disagreements with tax authorities can adversely affect our financial performance. Increases in income tax rates or other changes in tax laws, including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, can adversely affect our financial performance. For example, economic and political conditions in countries where we are subject to taxes, including the United States, have in the past and could continue to result in significant changes in tax legislation or regulation, including as a result of any changes enacted during the new U.S. presidential administration. The increasingly complex global tax environment has in the past and could continue to increase tax uncertainty, resulting in higher compliance costs and adverse effects on our financial performance. We are also subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by numerous taxing authorities with respect to income and non-income based taxes. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in jurisdictions in which we operate, or the adoption of new or reformed tax legislation or regulation, may make resolving tax disputes more difficult and the final resolution of tax audits and any related litigation can differ from our historical provisions and accruals, resulting in an adverse effect on our financial performance. If we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, or if we are found to infringe on the intellectual property rights of others, our business can be adversely affected. We possess intellectual property rights that are important to our business, including ingredient formulas, trademarks, copyrights, patents, business processes and other trade secrets. The laws of various jurisdictions in which we operate have differing levels of protection of intellectual property. Our competitive position and the value of our products and brands can be reduced and our business adversely affected if we fail to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property, including our ingredient formulas, or if there is a change in law that limits or removes the current legal protections afforded our intellectual property. Also, if, in the course of developing new products or improving the quality of existing products, we are found to have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others, directly or indirectly, such finding can damage our reputation and limit our ability to introduce new products or improve the quality of existing products, resulting in an adverse effect on our business. Failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our business can adversely affect our business. The conduct of our business is subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the production, storage, distribution, sale, display, advertising, marketing, labeling, content (including whether a product contains genetically engineered ingredients), quality, safety, transportation, traceability, packaging, disposal, recycling and use of our products, employment and occupational health and safety, environmental matters (including pesticide use) and data privacy and protection. In addition, in many jurisdictions, compliance with competition laws is of special importance to us due to our competitive position, as is compliance with anti-corruption laws. The imposition of new laws, changes in laws or regulatory requirements or changing interpretations thereof, and differing or competing regulations and standards across the markets where our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, have in the past and could continue to result in higher compliance costs, capital expenditures and higher production costs, resulting in adverse effects on our business. In addition, if one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new laws or regulations that impact the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products, other jurisdictions can often follow. Failure to comply with such laws or regulations can subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions, including fines, injunctions, product recalls, penalties, disgorgement of profits or activity restrictions, all of which can adversely affect our business. 21 Table of Contents Potential liabilities and costs from litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations can have an adverse impact on our business. We and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations, including but not limited to matters related to our advertising, marketing or commercial practices, product labels, claims and ingredients, intellectual property rights, environmental, privacy, employment, tax and insurance matters and matters relating to our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. These matters are inherently uncertain and there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves or that our assessment of the materiality of these matters and the likely outcome or potential losses and established reserves will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such matters. Responding to these matters, even those that are ultimately non-meritorious, requires us to incur significant expense and devote significant resources, and may generate adverse publicity that damages our reputation or brand image. Any of the foregoing can adversely affect our business. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. We have received no written comments regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff of the SEC that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of our 2020 year and that remain unresolved. 22 Table of Contents Item 2. Properties. Our principal executive office located in Purchase, New York and our facilities located in Plano, Texas, all of which we own, are our most significant corporate properties. In connection with making, marketing, distributing and selling our products, each division utilizes manufacturing, processing, bottling and production plants, warehouses, distribution centers, storage facilities, offices, including division headquarters, research and development facilities and other facilities, all of which are either owned or leased. Significant properties by division are as follows: Property Type Location Owned/ Leased FLNA Research and development facility Plano, Texas Owned QFNA Food plant Cedar Rapids, Iowa Owned PBNA Research and development facility Valhalla, New York Owned PBNA Concentrate plant Arlington, Texas Owned PBNA Tropicana plant Bradenton, Florida Owned LatAm Snack plant Celaya, Mexico Owned LatAm Two snack plants Vallejo, Mexico Owned Europe Snack plant Kashira, Russia Owned Europe Manufacturing plant Lehavim, Israel Owned Europe Dairy plant Moscow, Russia Owned (a) AMESA Snack plant Riyadh, Saudi Arabia Owned (a) APAC Snack plant Wuhan, China Owned (a) FLNA, QFNA, PBNA Shared service center Winston Salem, North Carolina Leased PBNA, LatAm Concentrate plant Colonia, Uruguay Owned (a) PBNA, Europe, AMESA Two concentrate plants Cork, Ireland Owned PBNA, AMESA, APAC Concentrate plant Singapore Owned (a) All divisions Shared service center Hyderabad, India Leased (a) The land on which these plants are located is leased. Most of our plants are owned or leased on a long-term basis. In addition to company-owned or leased properties described above, we also utilize a highly distributed network of plants, warehouses and distribution centers that are owned or leased by our contract manufacturers, co-packers, strategic alliances or joint ventures in which we have an equity interest. We believe that our properties generally are in good operating condition and, taken as a whole, are suitable, adequate and of sufficient capacity for our current operations. Item 3. Legal Proceedings. We and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations. While the results of such litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the final outcome of the foregoing will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.

OUR BUSINESS Executive Overview PepsiCo is a leading global food and beverage company with a complementary portfolio of brands, including Frito-Lay, Gatorade, Pepsi-Cola, Quaker and Tropicana. Through our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a wide variety of convenient beverages, foods and snacks, serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories Everything we do is driven by an approach we call Winning with Purpose. Winning with Purpose is our guide for achieving accelerated, sustainable growth that includes our mission, to Create More Smiles with Every Sip and Every Bite; our vision, to Be the Global Leader in Convenient Foods and Beverages by Winning with Purpose; and The PepsiCo Way, seven behaviors that define our shared culture. This approach proved prescient and powerful in 2020 as we faced a worsening climate crisis, renewed calls for racial equality, and the first global pandemic in a century. Life in communities around the world was transformed, and our business was tested like never before. First and foremost, we had to protect the health of our associates, so that we could continue to serve our consumers, customers and communities. At the same time, we had to secure our supply chain; ensure continuity in manufacturing, distribution and sales; further strengthen our e-commerce and digital capabilities; reimagine our marketing; deliver positive outcomes for people, our shareholders and the planet; and much more. These challenges were in addition to the structural issues facing our Company, including: shifting consumer preferences and behaviors; a highly competitive operating environment; a rapidly changing retail landscape, including the growth in e-commerce; continued macroeconomic and political volatility; and an evolving regulatory landscape. To meet this once in a generation moment and ensure our Company’s long-term success, we will continue to focus on becoming Faster, Stronger, and Better: • We will become Faster by sustaining or improving growth and market share in our high return foods and snacks businesses in North America; improving the profitability of our PBNA business and capturing our fair share of category growth; accelerating our growth and presence in international snacks and food while investing wisely in beverages to balance between growth and returns; and making the necessary investments in our manufacturing capacity, go-to-market systems and digital initiatives, such as improving our presence and scale in our e-commerce business. 29 Table of Contents • We will become Stronger by renewing our focus on driving holistic cost management throughout our organization to support our investments in advantaged capabilities, such as a highly agile and flexible end-to-end value chain; more precision around revenue management; and investing in data analytics that can provide more granularity around consumer insights. We also plan to continue investing to further expand global business services into new capabilities, which will enable better insight and support for our businesses at a lower cost. And we will remain focused on diversifying our workforce and reinforcing The PepsiCo Way, where we emphasize that employees act like owners to get things done quickly. • We will become Better by further integrating purpose into our business strategy and brands by becoming planet positive, strengthening our roots in our communities, and advancing social justice. This includes supporting practices and technologies that improve farmer livelihoods and agricultural resiliency; using precious resources such as water more efficiently; accelerating our efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions throughout our value chain; driving progress toward a world where plastics need never become waste; advancing respect for human rights; and investing to promote shared prosperity in local communities where we live and work. We believe these priorities will position our Company for long-term sustainable growth. See also “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further information about risks and uncertainties that the Company faces. Our Operations See “Item 1. Business” for information on our divisions and a description of our distribution network, ingredients and other supplies, brands and intellectual property rights, seasonality, customers, competition and human capital. In addition, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for financial information about our divisions and geographic areas. Other Relationships Certain members of our Board of Directors also serve on the boards of certain vendors and customers. These Board members do not participate in our vendor selection and negotiations nor in our customer negotiations. Our transactions with these vendors and customers are in the normal course of business and are consistent with terms negotiated with other vendors and customers. In addition, certain of our employees serve on the boards of Pepsi Bottling Ventures LLC and other affiliated companies of PepsiCo and do not receive incremental compensation for such services. Our Business Risks COVID-19 Our global operations continue to expose us to risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, which continues to result in challenging operating environments and has affected almost all of the more than 200 countries and territories in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. Travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, curfews, restrictions on public gatherings, shelter in place and safer-at-home orders, business shutdowns and closures continue in many of these markets. These measures have impacted and will continue to impact us, our customers (including foodservice customers), consumers, employees, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners, suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business, which may result in changes in demand for our products, increases in operating costs (whether as a result of changes to our supply chain or increases in employee costs, including expanded benefits and frontline incentives, costs associated with the provision of personal protective equipment and increased sanitation, or otherwise), or adverse impacts to our supply chain through reduced availability of air or other commercial transport, port closures or border restrictions, any 30 Table of Contents of which can impact our ability to make, manufacture, distribute and sell our products. In addition, measures that impact our ability to access our offices (several of which remain closed), plants, warehouses, distribution centers or other facilities, or that impact the ability of our customers (including our foodservice customers), consumers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners, suppliers and other third parties to do the same, may continue to impact the availability or productivity of our and their employees, many of whom are not able to perform their job functions remotely. Public concern regarding the risk of contracting COVID-19 has impacted and may continue to impact demand from consumers, including due to consumers not leaving their homes or leaving their homes less often than they did prior to the start of the pandemic or otherwise shopping for and consuming food and beverage products in a different manner than they historically have or because some of our consumers have lower discretionary income due to unemployment or reduced or limited work as a result of measures taken in response to the pandemic. Even as governmental restrictions are relaxed and economies gradually, partially, or fully reopen in certain of these jurisdictions and markets, the ongoing economic impacts and health concerns associated with the pandemic may continue to affect consumer behavior, spending levels and shopping and consumption preferences. In addition, as a result of COVID-19, certain jurisdictions, such as certain states in Mexico, have enacted or are considering enacting new or expanded product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of certain of our products as a result of ingredients or substances contained in such products. Changes in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns may increase demand for our products in one quarter, resulting in decreased demand for our products in subsequent quarters, or in a lower-margin sales channel resulting in potentially reduced profit from sales of our products. We continue to see shifts in product and channel preferences as markets move through varying stages of restrictions and re-opening at different times, including changes in at-home consumption, in immediate consumption and away-from-home channels, such as convenience and gas and foodservice. In addition, we continue to see a rapid increase in demand in the e-commerce and online-to-offline channels and any failure to capitalize on this demand could adversely affect our ability to maintain and grow sales or category share and erode our competitive position. Any reduced demand for our products or change in consumer purchasing and consumption patterns, as well as continued economic uncertainty, can adversely affect our customers’ and business partners’ financial condition, which can result in bankruptcy filings and/or an inability to pay for our products, reduced or canceled orders of our products, continued or additional closing of restaurants, stores, entertainment or sports complexes, schools or other venues in which our products are sold, or reduced capacity at any of the foregoing, or our business partners’ inability to supply us with ingredients or other items necessary for us to make, manufacture, distribute or sell our products. Such adverse changes in our customers’ or business partners’ financial condition have also resulted and may continue to result in our recording additional charges for our inability to recover or collect any accounts receivable, owned or leased assets, including certain foodservice and vending and other equipment, or prepaid expenses. In addition, continued economic uncertainty associated with the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in volatility in the global capital and credit markets which can impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. While we have developed and implemented and continue to develop and implement health and safety protocols, business continuity plans and crisis management protocols in an effort to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19 to our employees and our business, the extent of the impact of the pandemic on our business and financial results will continue to depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict and which will vary by jurisdiction and market, including the duration and scope of the pandemic, the development and availability of effective treatments and vaccines, global economic conditions during and after the pandemic, governmental actions that have been taken, or may be taken in 31 Table of Contents the future, in response to the pandemic and changes in consumer behavior in response to the pandemic, some of which may be more than just temporary. Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) The CARES Act was enacted on March 27, 2020 in the United States. The CARES Act and related notices include several significant provisions, such as delaying certain payroll tax payments, mandatory transition tax payments under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJ Act) and estimated income tax payments. The CARES Act did not have a material impact on our financial results in 2020, including on our annual estimated effective tax rate or on our liquidity. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact similar legislation in other countries may have on our business and financial results. Refer to the COVID-19 discussion above and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Risks Associated with International Operations We are subject to risks in the normal course of business. During the periods presented in this report, certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold operated in a challenging environment, experiencing unstable economic, political and social conditions, civil unrest, natural disasters, debt and credit issues and currency controls or fluctuations. We continue to monitor the economic, operating and political environment in these markets closely and to identify actions to potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results. Imposition of Taxes and Regulations on our Products Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes or regulations on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products or their packaging, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or their packaging, commodities used in the production of our products or their packaging or the recyclability or recoverability of our packaging. These taxes and regulations vary in scope and form. For example, some taxes apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). In addition, some regulations apply to all products using certain types of packaging (e.g., plastic), while others are designed to increase the sustainability of packaging, encourage waste reduction and increased recycling rates or facilitate the waste management process or restrict the sale of products in certain packaging. We sell a wide variety of beverages, foods and snacks in more than 200 countries and territories and the profile of the products we sell, the amount of revenue attributable to such products and the type of packaging used vary by jurisdiction. Because of this, we cannot predict the scope or form potential taxes, regulations or other limitations on our products or their packaging may take, and therefore cannot predict the impact of such taxes, regulations or limitations on our financial results. In addition, taxes, regulations and limitations may impact us and our competitors differently. We continue to monitor existing and proposed taxes and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such taxes, regulations or limitations, including advocating alternative measures with respect to the imposition, form and scope of any such taxes, regulations or limitations. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. The related provisional measurement period allowed by the SEC ended in the fourth quarter of 2018. While our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act was deemed to be complete, additional guidance issued by the IRS impacted our recorded amounts after December 29, 2018. For further information, see “Our Liquidity and 32 Table of Contents Capital Resources,” “Our Critical Accounting Policies” and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements. Other Tax Matters On May 19, 2019, a public referendum held in Switzerland passed the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (TRAF), effective January 1, 2020. The enactment of certain provisions of the TRAF resulted in adjustments to our deferred taxes. During 2020, we recorded a net tax benefit of $72 million related to the adoption of the TRAF in the Swiss Canton of Bern. During 2019, we recorded net tax expense of $24 million related to the impact of the TRAF. See “Our Critical Accounting Policies” and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Retail Landscape Our industry continues to be affected by disruption of the retail landscape, including the rapid growth in sales through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription services, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers and the international expansion of hard discounters. We have seen and expect to continue to see a further shift to e-commerce, online-to-offline, and other online purchasing by consumers, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to monitor changes in the retail landscape and seek to identify actions we may take to build our global e-commerce and digital capabilities, such as expanding our direct-to-consumer business, and distribute our products effectively through all existing and emerging channels of trade and potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results. See also “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Executive Overview” above and “Market Risks” below for more information about these risks and the actions we have taken to address key challenges. Risk Management Framework The achievement of our strategic and operating objectives involves taking risks and that those risks may evolve over time. To identify, assess, prioritize, address, manage, monitor and communicate these risks across the Company’s operations, we leverage an integrated risk management framework. This framework includes the following: • PepsiCo’s Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for PepsiCo’s integrated risk management framework. One of the Board’s primary responsibilities is overseeing and interacting with senior management with respect to key aspects of the Company’s business, including risk assessment and risk mitigation of the Company’s top risks. The Board receives updates on key risks throughout the year, including risks related to cybersecurity. During 2020, in addition to COVID-19 discussions as part of risk updates to the Board and the relevant Committees, the Board was provided with updates on COVID-19’s impact to our business, financial condition and operations through memos, teleconferences or other appropriate means of communication. In addition, the Board has tasked designated Committees of the Board with oversight of certain categories of risk management, and the Committees report to the Board regularly on these matters. ◦ The Audit Committee of the Board reviews and assesses the guidelines and policies governing PepsiCo’s risk management and oversight processes, and assists the Board’s oversight of financial, compliance and employee safety risks facing PepsiCo; ◦ The Compensation Committee of the Board reviews PepsiCo’s employee compensation policies and practices to assess whether such policies and practices could lead to unnecessary risk-taking behavior; 33 Table of Contents ◦ The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee assists the Board in its oversight of the Company’s governance structure and other corporate governance matters, including succession planning; and ◦ The Sustainability, Diversity and Public Policy Committee of the Board assists the Board in its oversight of PepsiCo’s policies, programs and related risks that concern key sustainability, diversity and inclusion, and public policy matters. • The PepsiCo Risk Committee (PRC), which is comprised of a cross-functional, geographically diverse, senior management group, including PepsiCo’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, meets regularly to identify, assess, prioritize and address top strategic, financial, operating, compliance, safety, reputational and other risks. The PRC is also responsible for reporting progress on our risk mitigation efforts to the Board; • Division and key country risk committees, comprised of cross-functional senior management teams, meet regularly to identify, assess, prioritize and address division and country-specific business risks; • PepsiCo’s Risk Management Office, which manages the overall risk management process, provides ongoing guidance, tools and analytical support to the PRC and the division and key country risk committees, identifies and assesses potential risks and facilitates ongoing communication between the parties, as well as with PepsiCo’s Board of Directors, the Audit Committee of the Board and other Committees of the Board; • PepsiCo’s Corporate Audit Department evaluates the ongoing effectiveness of our key internal controls through periodic audit and review procedures; and • PepsiCo’s Compliance & Ethics and Law Departments lead and coordinate our compliance policies and practices. Market Risks We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in: • commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy; • foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and • interest rates. In the normal course of business, we manage commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of strategies, including productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs and hedging. Ongoing productivity initiatives involve the identification and effective implementation of meaningful cost-saving opportunities or efficiencies, including the use of derivatives. Our global purchasing programs include fixed-price contracts and purchase orders and pricing agreements. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion of our market risks, and see “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information on our non-cancelable purchasing commitments. The fair value of our derivatives fluctuates based on market rates and prices. The sensitivity of our derivatives to these market fluctuations is discussed below. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these derivatives and our hedging policies. See “Our Critical Accounting Policies” for a discussion of the exposure of our pension and retiree medical plan assets and liabilities to risks related to market fluctuations. Inflationary, deflationary and recessionary conditions impacting these market risks also impact the demand for and pricing of our products. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion. 34 Table of Contents Commodity Prices Our commodity derivatives had a total notional value of $1.1 billion as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019. At the end of 2020, the potential change in fair value of commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10% decrease in the underlying commodity price, would have decreased our net unrealized gains in 2020 by $121 million, which would generally be offset by a reduction in the cost of the underlying commodity purchases. Foreign Exchange Our operations outside of the United States generated 42% of our consolidated net revenue in 2020, with Mexico, Russia, Canada, the United Kingdom, China and South Africa, collectively, comprising approximately 21% of our consolidated net revenue in 2020. As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risks in the international markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. Additionally, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency purchases, foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. During 2020, unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net revenue growth by 2 percentage points, primarily due to declines in the Mexican peso, Russian ruble and Brazilian real. Currency declines against the U.S. dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our future financial results. In addition, volatile economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, including in Argentina, Brazil, China, Mexico, the Middle East, Russia and Turkey, and currency controls or fluctuations in certain of these international markets, continue to, and the threat or imposition of new or increased tariffs or sanctions or other impositions in or related to these international markets may, result in challenging operating environments. We also continue to monitor the economic and political developments related to the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union (Brexit), including the effects of the post-Brexit trade deal entered into between the United Kingdom and the European Union in December 2020, as well as the economic, operating and political environment in Russia and the potential impact for the Europe segment and our other businesses. Our foreign currency derivatives had a total notional value of $1.9 billion as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019. At the end of 2020, we estimate that an unfavorable 10% change in the underlying exchange rates would have increased our net unrealized losses in 2020 by $175 million, which would be significantly offset by an inverse change in the fair value of the underlying exposure. The total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was $2.7 billion as of December 26, 2020 and $2.5 billion as of December 28, 2019. Interest Rates Our interest rate derivatives had a total notional value of $3.0 billion as of December 26, 2020 and $5.0 billion as of December 28, 2019. Assuming year-end 2020 investment levels and variable rate debt, a 1-percentage-point increase in interest rates would have decreased our net interest expense in 2020 by $80 million due to higher cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments levels, as compared with our variable rate debt. OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS Results of Operations — Consolidated Review Volume Physical or unit volume is one of the key metrics management uses internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan and the evaluation of our business performance. We believe volume provides additional information to facilitate the comparison of 35 Table of Contents our historical operating performance and underlying trends, and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. Beverage volume includes volume of concentrate sold to independent bottlers and volume of finished products bearing company-owned or licensed trademarks and allied brand products and joint venture trademarks sold by company-owned bottling operations, including by our noncontrolled affiliates. Concentrate volume sold to independent bottlers is reported in concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE), whereas finished beverage product volume is reported in bottler case sales (BCS). Both CSE and BCS convert all beverage volume to an 8-ounce-case metric. Typically, CSE and BCS are not equal in any given period due to seasonality, timing of product launches, product mix, bottler inventory practices and other factors. While our net revenue is not entirely based on BCS volume due to the independent bottlers in our supply chain, we believe that BCS is a better measure of the consumption of our beverage products. PBNA, LatAm, Europe, AMESA and APAC, either independently or in conjunction with third parties, make, market, distribute and sell ready-to-drink tea products through a joint venture with Unilever (under the Lipton brand name), and PBNA, either independently or in conjunction with third parties, makes, markets, distributes and sells ready-to-drink coffee products through a joint venture with Starbucks. In addition, APAC licenses the Tropicana brand for use in China on co-branded juice products in connection with a strategic alliance with Tingyi. Food and snack volume includes volume sold by our subsidiaries and noncontrolled affiliates of snack products bearing company-owned or licensed trademarks. Internationally, we measure food and snack product volume in kilograms, while in North America we measure food and snack product volume in pounds. FLNA makes, markets, distributes and sells Sabra refrigerated dips and spreads through a joint venture with Strauss Group. Consolidated Net Revenue and Operating Profit 2020 2019 Change Net revenue $ 70,372 $ 67,161 5 % Operating profit $ 10,080 $ 10,291 (2) % Operating profit margin 14.3 % 15.3 % (1.0) See “Results of Operations – Division Review” for a tabular presentation and discussion of key drivers of net revenue. Operating profit decreased 2% and operating profit margin declined 1.0 percentage point. Operating profit performance was primarily driven by certain operating cost increases, partially offset by net revenue growth and productivity savings. The charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted operating profit performance by 7 percentage points. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Additionally, higher inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges included in “Items Affecting Comparability” and unfavorable foreign exchange each negatively impacted operating profit performance by 2 percentage points. 36 Table of Contents Results of Operations — Division Review See “Non-GAAP Measures” and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a discussion of items to consider when evaluating our results and related information regarding measures not in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). In the discussions of net revenue and operating profit below, “effective net pricing” reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries, and “net pricing” reflects the year-over-year combined impact of list price changes, weight changes per package, discounts and allowances. Additionally, “acquisitions and divestitures” reflect all mergers and acquisitions activity, including the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees. Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth Organic revenue growth is a non-GAAP financial measure.

In certain instances, the impact of organic volume growth on net revenue growth differs from the unit volume growth disclosed in the following divisional discussions due to product mix, nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our beverage businesses, temporary timing differences between BCS and CSE. Our net revenue excludes nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our franchise-owned beverage businesses, is based on CSE. 37 Table of Contents Operating Profit, Operating Profit Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability and Operating Profit Growth Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability on a Constant Currency Basis Operating profit adjusted for items affecting comparability and operating profit growth adjusted for items affecting comparability on a constant currency basis are both non-GAAP financial measures.

(b) Amounts may not sum due to rounding. FLNA Net revenue grew 7% and unit volume grew 3%. The net revenue growth was driven by effective net pricing and organic volume growth. The unit volume growth primarily reflects double-digit growth in variety packs and dips, and high-single-digit growth in trademark Tostitos and Ruffles, partially offset by a double-digit decline in nuts and seeds. Operating profit increased 2%, primarily reflecting the net revenue growth and productivity savings, partially offset by certain operating cost increases. Additionally, the charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic reduced operating profit growth by 4 percentage points. QFNA Net revenue and unit volume each increased 10%. The net revenue growth reflects organic volume growth and favorable pricing, partially offset by unfavorable mix. The unit volume growth was driven by double-digit growth in oatmeal and pancake syrup and mix and high-single-digit growth in ready-to-eat cereals. The COVID-19 pandemic drove an increase in consumer demand, which had a positive impact on both net revenue and unit volume growth. Operating profit grew 23%, reflecting the net revenue growth and productivity savings, partially offset by certain operating cost increases. Additionally, the charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic reduced operating profit growth by 3 percentage points. PBNA Net revenue increased 4%, primarily driven by effective net pricing, partially offset by a decrease in organic volume. Unit volume decreased 1%, driven by a 5% decrease in CSD volume, largely offset by a 4% increase in non-carbonated beverage (NCB) volume. The NCB volume increase primarily reflected a high-single-digit increase in Gatorade sports drinks, a double-digit increase in our energy portfolio, primarily due to acquisitions, and a low-single-digit increase in our overall water portfolio, partially offset by a mid-single-digit decrease in our juice and juice drinks portfolio. In addition, acquisitions contributed 2 percentage points to net revenue growth. 39 Table of Contents Operating profit decreased 11%, reflecting certain operating cost increases, including incremental information technology costs, a 14-percentage-point impact of the charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the organic volume decrease. These impacts were partially offset by the effective net pricing, productivity savings, lower advertising and marketing expenses, and a 4-percentage-point impact of lower commodity costs. Prior-year gains associated with sales of assets negatively impacted operating profit performance by 2 percentage points. Additionally, impairment charges associated with a coconut water brand negatively impacted operating profit performance by 2 percentage points. Acquisitions positively contributed 4 percentage points to operating profit performance. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we received notice of termination without cause from Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which would end our distribution rights of Bang Energy drinks, effective October 24, 2023. LatAm Net revenue decreased 8%, primarily reflecting an 11-percentage-point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange, partially offset by effective net pricing. Snacks unit volume grew slightly, primarily reflecting low-single-digit growth in Brazil, partially offset by a slight decline in Mexico. Beverage unit volume declined 1%, primarily reflecting a high-single-digit decline in Argentina, a mid-single-digit decline in Honduras and a low-single-digit decline in Guatemala, partially offset by double-digit growth in Brazil, low-single-digit growth in Mexico and mid-single-digit growth in Chile. The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a decrease in consumer demand, which had a negative impact on beverage unit volume performance. Operating profit decreased 10%, primarily reflecting certain operating cost increases and a 9-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs due to transaction-related foreign exchange. These impacts were partially offset by productivity savings and the effective net pricing. Additionally, unfavorable foreign exchange and certain charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted operating profit performance by 11 percentage points and 8 percentage points, respectively. Europe Net revenue increased 2%, reflecting organic volume growth, partially offset by a 4-percentage-point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange. Snacks unit volume grew 4%, primarily reflecting double-digit growth in Turkey, high-single-digit growth in the United Kingdom and France and mid-single-digit growth in the Netherlands, partially offset by a low-single-digit decline in Spain. Additionally, Russia and Poland each experienced low-single-digit growth. Beverage unit volume grew 11%, primarily reflecting double-digit growth in Germany and France, partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in Poland and a low-single-digit decline in Turkey. Additionally, Russia experienced low-single-digit growth and the United Kingdom experienced mid-single-digit growth. Operating profit increased 2%, primarily reflecting the organic volume growth, productivity savings, a 4-percentage-point impact of lower restructuring and impairment charges, a 3-percentage-point impact of the prior-year inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges primarily associated with our acquisition of SodaStream International Ltd. (SodaStream) and a 2-percentage-point impact of a gain on an asset sale. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases and a 2-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs due to transaction-related foreign exchange. Additionally, the charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and unfavorable foreign exchange reduced operating profit growth by 6 percentage points and 4 percentage points, respectively. 40 Table of Contents AMESA Net revenue increased 25%, primarily reflecting a 28-percentage-point impact of the Pioneer Foods acquisition, partially offset by a 3-percentage-point impact of the prior-year refranchising of a portion of our beverage business in India. Net revenue was also negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Snacks unit volume grew 199%, primarily reflecting a 195-percentage-point impact of the Pioneer Foods acquisition, double-digit growth in Pakistan and mid-single-digit growth in the Middle East. Additionally, India and South Africa (excluding our Pioneer Foods acquisition) each experienced low-single-digit growth. Beverage unit volume declined 5%, primarily reflecting a double-digit decline in India and a high-single-digit decline in Pakistan, partially offset by slight growth in the Middle East and low-single-digit growth in Nigeria. Our Pioneer Foods acquisition positively contributed 2 percentage points to beverage unit volume performance. The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a decrease in consumer demand, which had a negative impact on beverage unit volume performance. Operating profit decreased 11%, primarily reflecting certain operating cost increases, partially offset by productivity savings, lower advertising and marketing expenses and a 3-percentage-point impact of lower commodity costs. The inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges associated with our Pioneer Foods acquisition negatively impacted operating profit performance by 24 percentage points and were partially offset by Pioneer Foods’ 9-percentage-point positive contribution to operating profit performance. Additionally, the charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted operating profit performance by 5 percentage points. APAC Net revenue increased 18%, primarily reflecting a 10-percentage-point impact of our Be & Cheery acquisition, organic volume growth and effective net pricing. Snacks unit volume grew 17%, primarily reflecting a 10-percentage-point impact of our Be & Cheery acquisition and double-digit growth in Indonesia, partially offset by a low-single-digit decline in Thailand. Additionally, China (excluding our Be & Cheery acquisition) and Australia each experienced mid-single-digit growth and Taiwan experienced low-single-digit growth. Beverage unit volume grew 1%, primarily reflecting high-single-digit growth in China, partially offset by a double-digit decline in the Philippines, a mid-single-digit decline in Vietnam and a low-single-digit decline in Thailand. The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a decrease in consumer demand, which had a negative impact on beverage unit volume growth. Operating profit increased 24%, primarily reflecting the net revenue growth, productivity savings and a 10-percentage-point impact of lower restructuring and impairment charges, partially offset by certain operating cost increases and higher advertising and marketing expenses. 41 Table of Contents Other Consolidated Results 2020 2019 Change Other pension and retiree medical benefits income/(expense) $ 117 $ (44) $ 161 Net interest expense and other $ (1,128) $ (935) $ (193) Annual tax rate 20.9 % 21.0 % Net income attributable to PepsiCo (a) $ 7,120 $ 7,314 (3) % Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted (a) $ 5.12 $ 5.20 (2) % (a) The charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted both net income attributable to PepsiCo performance and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share performance by 8 percentage points. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Other pension and retiree medical benefits income increased $161 million, primarily reflecting the recognition of fixed income gains on plan assets, the impact of discretionary plan contributions and higher prior-year settlement losses, partially offset by the decrease in discount rates. Net interest expense and other increased $193 million, primarily due to higher average debt balances, lower interest rates on cash, as well as lower gains on the market value of investments used to economically hedge a portion of our deferred compensation liability. These impacts were partially offset by lower interest rates on debt and higher average cash balances. The reported tax rate decreased 0.1 percentage points, primarily reflecting the net tax benefits related to the TRAF, partially offset by an increase in reserves for uncertain tax positions in foreign jurisdictions. Non-GAAP Measures Certain financial measures contained in this Form 10-K adjust for the impact of specified items and are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures in this Form 10-K allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends. We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring plans; amounts associated with mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes; pension and retiree medical related items; charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as significant tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; asset impairments (non-cash); and remeasurements of net monetary assets. See below and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a description of adjustments to our U.S. GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K. Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. 42 Table of Contents The following non-GAAP financial measures contained in this Form 10-K are discussed below: Cost of sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, other pension and retiree medical benefits income/expense, provision for income taxes, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and net income attributable to PepsiCo, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, operating profit and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, and the corresponding constant currency growth rates These measures exclude the net impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on centrally managed commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, restructuring and impairment charges related to our 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan (2019 Productivity Plan) and our 2014 Multi-Year Productivity Plan (2014 Productivity Plan), inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges associated with our acquisitions, pension-related settlement charges and net tax related to the TCJ Act (see “Items Affecting Comparability” for a detailed description of each of these items). We also evaluate performance on operating profit, adjusted for items affecting comparability, and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, adjusted for items affecting comparability, each on a constant currency basis, which measure our financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. We believe these measures provide useful information in evaluating the results of our business because they exclude items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance. Organic revenue growth We define organic revenue growth as net revenue growth adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange translation, as well as the impact from acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes. We believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year. See “Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth” in “Results of Operations – Division Review” for further information. Free cash flow We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital spending, plus sales of property, plant and equipment. Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities. Free cash flow is used by us primarily for acquisitions and financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure. See “Free Cash Flow” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information. 43 Table of Contents Return on invested capital (ROIC) and net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability We define ROIC as net income attributable to PepsiCo plus interest expense after-tax divided by the sum of quarterly average debt obligations and quarterly average common shareholders’ equity. Although ROIC is a common financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating ROIC. Accordingly, the method used by management to calculate ROIC may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their ROIC. We believe this metric serves as a measure of how well we use our capital to generate returns. In addition, we use net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability, to compare our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis because it removes from our operating results the impact of items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance and reflects how management evaluates our operating results and trends. We define net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability, as ROIC, adjusted for quarterly average cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, after-tax interest income and items affecting comparability. We believe the calculation of ROIC and net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability, provides useful information to investors and is an additional relevant comparison of our performance to consider when evaluating our capital allocation efficiency. See “Return on Invested Capital” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information. Items Affecting Comparability Our reported financial results in this Form 10-K are impacted by the following items in each of the following years: 2020 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 31,797 $ 38,575 $ 28,495 $ 10,080 $ 117 $ 1,894 $ 7,120 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact 64 (64) 9 (73) — (15) (58) Restructuring and impairment charges (30) 30 (239) 269 20 58 231 Inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges (32) 32 (223) 255 — 18 237 Pension-related settlement charge — — — — 205 47 158 Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 31,799 $ 38,573 $ 28,042 $ 10,531 $ 342 $ 2,002 $ 7,688 2019 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits (expense)/income Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 30,132 $ 37,029 $ 26,738 $ 10,291 $ (44) $ 1,959 $ 39 $ 7,314 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact 57 (57) 55 (112) — (25) — (87) Restructuring and impairment charges (115) 115 (253) 368 2 67 5 298 Inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges (34) 34 (21) 55 — 8 — 47 Pension-related settlement charges — — — — 273 62 — 211 Net tax related to the TCJ Act — — — — — 8 — (8) Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 30,040 $ 37,121 $ 26,519 $ 10,602 $ 231 $ 2,079 $ 44 $ 7,775 44 Table of Contents (a) Provision for income taxes is the expected tax charge/benefit on the underlying item based on the tax laws and income tax rates applicable to the underlying item in its corresponding tax jurisdiction. 2020 2019 Change Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, GAAP measure $ 5.12 $ 5.20 (2) % Mark-to-market net impact (0.04) (0.06) Restructuring and impairment charges 0.17 0.21 Inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges 0.17 0.03 Pension-related settlement charges 0.11 0.15 Net tax related to the TCJ Act — (0.01) Core net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, non-GAAP measure $ 5.52 (a) $ 5.53 (a) — % Impact of foreign exchange translation 2 Growth in core net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, on a constant currency basis, non-GAAP measure 2 % (a) Does not sum due to rounding. Mark-to-Market Net Impact We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include agricultural products, energy and metals. Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in corporate unallocated expenses. Restructuring and Impairment Charges 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan The 2019 Productivity Plan, publicly announced on February 15, 2019, will leverage new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. In connection with this plan, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $2.5 billion, including cash expenditures of approximately $1.6 billion. Plan to date through December 26, 2020, we have incurred pre-tax charges of $797 million, including cash expenditures of $518 million. In our 2021 financial results, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $500 million, including cash expenditures of approximately $400 million, with the balance to be reflected in our 2022 and 2023 financial results. These charges will be funded primarily through cash from operations. We expect to incur the majority of the remaining pre-tax charges and cash expenditures in our 2021 and 2022 results. 2014 Multi-Year Productivity Plan The 2014 Productivity Plan was completed in 2019. The total plan pre-tax charges and cash expenditures approximated the previously disclosed plan estimates of $1.3 billion and $960 million, respectively. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further information related to our 2019 and 2014 Productivity Plans. We regularly evaluate productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plans and other initiatives discussed above and in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. Inventory Fair Value Adjustments and Merger and Integration Charges In 2020, we recorded inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges related to our acquisitions of BFY Brands, Inc. (BFY Brands), Rockstar, Pioneer Foods and Be & Cheery. Inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges include fair value adjustments to the acquired 45 Table of Contents inventory included in the acquisition-date balance sheets and closing costs, employee-related costs, contract termination costs, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration and other integration costs. Merger and integration charges also include liabilities to support socioeconomic programs in South Africa, which are irrevocable conditions of our acquisition of Pioneer Foods. In 2019, we recorded inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges primarily related to SodaStream’s acquired inventory included in acquisition-date balance sheet, as well as merger and integration charges, including employee-related costs. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Pension-Related Settlement Charges In 2020, we recorded a pension settlement charge related to lump sum distributions exceeding the total of annual service and interest cost. In 2019, we recorded pension settlement charges related to the purchase of a group annuity contract and one-time lump sum payments to certain former employees who had vested benefits. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Net Tax Related to the TCJ Act During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. We recognized net tax benefits in 2019 related to the TCJ Act. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. 46 Table of Contents Our Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our cash generating capability and financial condition, together with our revolving credit facilities, working capital lines and other available methods of debt financing, such as commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs, including with respect to our net capital spending plans. Our primary sources of cash available to fund cash outflows, such as our anticipated dividend payments, debt repayments, payments for acquisitions, including the contingent consideration related to Rockstar, and the transition tax liability under the TCJ Act, include cash from operations, proceeds obtained from issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt and cash and cash equivalents. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Our Business Risks” and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Our sources and uses of cash were not materially adversely impacted by COVID-19 in 2020 and, to date, we have not identified any material liquidity deficiencies as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on the information currently available to us, we do not expect the impact of COVID-19 to have a material impact on our liquidity. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact COVID-19 may have on our business and financial results. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. The CARES Act and related notices include several significant provisions, such as delaying certain payroll tax payments, mandatory transition tax payments under the TCJ Act and estimated income tax payments. The CARES Act did not have a material impact on our financial results in 2020, including on our annual estimated effective tax rate or on our liquidity. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact similar legislation in other countries may have on our business and financial results. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Our Business Risks” for further information related to the COVID-19 pandemic. As of December 26, 2020, cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in our consolidated subsidiaries subject to currency controls or currency exchange restrictions were not material. The TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings, including $18.9 billion held in our consolidated subsidiaries outside the United States as of December 30, 2017. As of December 26, 2020, our mandatory transition tax liability was $3.2 billion, which must be paid through 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act; we currently expect to pay approximately $309 million of this liability in 2021. See “Credit Facilities and Long-Term Contractual Commitments.” Any additional guidance issued by the IRS may impact our recorded amounts for this transition tax liability. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the TCJ Act. As part of our evolving market practices, we work with our suppliers to optimize our terms and conditions, which include the extension of payment terms. Our current payment terms with a majority of our suppliers generally range from 60 to 90 days, which we deem to be commercially reasonable. We will continue to monitor economic conditions and market practice working with our suppliers to adjust as necessary. We also maintain voluntary supply chain finance agreements with several participating global financial institutions. Under these agreements, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, may elect to sell their accounts receivable with PepsiCo to these participating global financial institutions. Supplier participation in these financing arrangements is voluntary. Our suppliers negotiate their financing agreements directly with the respective global financial institutions and we are not a party to these agreements. These financing arrangements allow participating suppliers to leverage PepsiCo’s creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs, which generally provides our suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own. Neither PepsiCo nor any of its subsidiaries provide any guarantees to any third party in connection with these financing arrangements. We have no economic interest in our suppliers’ decision to participate in these agreements. Our obligations to our suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment terms, are not impacted. All outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in such financing arrangements are recorded within 47 Table of Contents accounts payable and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet. We have been informed by the participating financial institutions that as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, of our accounts payable to suppliers who participate in these financing arrangements are outstanding. These supply chain finance arrangements did not have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources in the periods presented and we do not expect such arrangements to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources for the foreseeable future. Furthermore, our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality. Working capital needs are impacted by weekly sales, which are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns and generally lowest in the first quarter. On a continuing basis, we consider various transactions to increase shareholder value and enhance our business results, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, dividends, share repurchases, productivity and other efficiency initiatives and other structural changes. These transactions may result in future cash proceeds or payments. The table below summarizes our cash activity: 2020 2019 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 10,613 $ 9,649 Net cash used for investing activities $ (11,619) $ (6,437) Net cash provided by/(used for) financing activities $ 3,819 $ (8,489) Operating Activities In 2020, net cash provided by operating activities was $10.6 billion, compared to $9.6 billion in the prior year. The increase in operating cash flow primarily reflects lower net cash tax payments and lower pre-tax pension and retiree medical plan contributions in the current year. Investing Activities In 2020, net cash used for investing activities was $11.6 billion, primarily reflecting net cash paid in connection with our acquisitions of Rockstar of $3.85 billion, Pioneer Foods of $1.2 billion and Be & Cheery of $0.7 billion, net capital spending of $4.2 billion, as well as purchases of short-term investments with maturities greater than three months of $1.1 billion. In 2019, net cash used for investing activities was $6.4 billion, primarily reflecting $4.1 billion of net capital spending, as well as $1.9 billion of the remaining cash paid in connection with our acquisition of SodaStream. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of capital spending by division; see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our investments in debt securities; and see Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our acquisitions. We regularly review our plans with respect to net capital spending, including in light of the ongoing uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, and believe that we have sufficient liquidity to meet our net capital spending needs. Financing Activities In 2020, net cash provided by financing activities was $3.8 billion, primarily reflecting proceeds from issuances of long-term debt of $13.8 billion, partially offset by the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases of $7.5 billion, payments of long-term debt borrowings of $1.8 billion and debt redemptions of $1.1 billion. 48 Table of Contents In 2019, net cash used for financing activities was $8.5 billion, primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases of $8.3 billion, payments of long-term debt borrowings of $4.0 billion and debt redemptions of $1.0 billion, partially offset by proceeds from issuances of long-term debt of $4.6 billion. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of debt obligations. We annually review our capital structure with our Board of Directors, including our dividend policy and share repurchase activity. On February 13, 2018, we announced the 2018 share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $15.0 billion of PepsiCo common stock which commenced on July 1, 2018 and will expire on June 30, 2021. In addition, on February 11, 2021, we announced a 5% increase in our annualized dividend to $4.30 per share from $4.09 per share, effective with the dividend expected to be paid in June 2021. We expect to return a total of approximately $5.9 billion to shareholders in 2021, comprised of dividends of approximately $5.8 billion and share repurchases of approximately $100 million. We have recently completed our share repurchase activity and do not expect to repurchase any additional shares for the balance of 2021. Free Cash Flow The table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities, as reflected in our cash flow statement, to our free cash flow. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on free cash flow see “Non-GAAP Measures.” 2020 2019 Change Net cash provided by operating activities, GAAP measure $ 10,613 $ 9,649 10 % Capital spending (4,240) (4,232) Sales of property, plant and equipment 55 170 Free cash flow, non-GAAP measure $ 6,428 $ 5,587 15 % We use free cash flow primarily for acquisitions and financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. We expect to continue to return free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global capital and credit markets at favorable interest rates. However, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Our Business Risks” for certain factors that may impact our credit ratings or our operating cash flows. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, whether or not as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Our Business Risks” and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion. 49 Table of Contents Credit Facilities and Long-Term Contractual Commitments See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our credit facilities. The following table summarizes our long-term contractual commitments by period: Payments Due by Period (a) Total 2021 2022 – 2023 2024 – 2025 2026 and beyond Recorded Liabilities: Long-term debt obligations (b) $ 40,330 $ — $ 6,895 $ 6,298 $ 27,137 Operating leases (c) 1,895 486 663 333 413 One-time mandatory transition tax - TCJ Act (d) 3,239 309 617 1,351 962 Other long-term liabilities (e) 1,277 159 135 140 843 Other: Interest on debt obligations (f) 15,988 1,160 2,043 1,771 11,014 Purchasing commitments (g) 2,295 894 1,034 246 121 Marketing commitments (h) 950 355 366 161 68 Other long-term contractual commitments (i) 347 85 167 95 — Total contractual commitments $ 66,321 $ 3,448 $ 11,920 $ 10,395 $ 40,558 (a) Based on year-end foreign exchange rates.

(c) Primarily reflects building leases. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on operating leases. (d) Reflects our transition tax liability as of December 26, 2020, which must be paid through 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act. (e) Reflects contingent consideration related to estimated future tax benefits associated with our acquisition of Rockstar. Also reflects commitments to support socioeconomic programs in South Africa, which are irrevocable conditions of our acquisition of Pioneer Foods. See Note 9 and Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. (f) Interest payments on floating-rate debt are estimated using interest rates effective as of December 26, 2020. Includes accrued interest of $352 million as of December 26, 2020. (g) Reflects non-cancelable commitments, primarily for the purchase of commodities and outsourcing services in the normal course of business and does not include purchases that we are likely to make based on our plans but are not obligated to incur. (h) Reflects non-cancelable commitments, primarily for sports marketing in the normal course of business. (i) Reflects our commitment to incur capital expenditures and/or business-related costs associated with our acquisition of Pioneer Foods. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Reserves for uncertain tax positions are excluded from the table above as we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of any such settlements. Bottler funding to independent bottlers is not reflected in the table above as it is negotiated on an annual basis. Accrued liabilities for pension and retiree medical plans are not reflected in the table above. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our pension and retiree medical obligations. Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements We do not have guarantees or other off-balance-sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity. We coordinate, on an aggregate basis, the contract negotiations of raw material requirements, including sweeteners, aluminum cans and plastic bottles and closures for us and certain of our independent bottlers. Once we have negotiated the contracts, the bottlers order and take delivery directly from the supplier and pay the suppliers directly. Consequently, transactions between our independent bottlers and suppliers are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. As the contracting party, we could be liable to these suppliers in the event of any nonpayment by our independent bottlers, but we consider this exposure to be remote. 50 Table of Contents Return on Invested Capital ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure.

These policies may require management to make difficult and subjective judgments regarding uncertainties, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and as a result, such estimates may significantly impact our financial results. The precision of these estimates and the likelihood of future changes depend on a number of underlying variables and a range of possible outcomes. We applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all material respects and for all periods presented. We have discussed our critical accounting policies with our Audit Committee. Our critical accounting policies are: • revenue recognition; • goodwill and other intangible assets; • income tax expense and accruals; and • pension and retiree medical plans. 51 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when our performance obligation is satisfied. Our primary performance obligation (the distribution and sales of beverage products and food and snack products) is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to our customers, which is also when control is transferred. The transfer of control of products to our customers is typically based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return. However, our policy for DSD, including certain chilled products, is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect. Similarly, our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. As a result, we record reserves, based on estimates, for anticipated damaged and out-of-date produc ts. We recorded $20 million of reserves for product returns in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic . See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Our products are sold for cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry practices, typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the United States, and generally within 30 to 90 days internationally, and may allow discounts for early payment. There were no material changes in credit terms as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We estimate and reserve for our expected credit loss exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility, write-off history, the aging of accounts receivable, our analysis of customer data, and forward-looking information (including the expected impact of the global economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic), leveraging estimates of creditworthiness and projections of default and recovery rates for certain of our customers (including foodservice and vending businesses). We recorded an allowance for expected credit losses of $56 million in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Our policy is to provide customers with product when needed. In fact, our commitment to freshness and product dating serves to regulate the quantity of product shipped or delivered. In addition, DSD products are placed on the shelf by our employees with customer shelf space and storerooms limiting the quantity of product. For product delivered through other distribution networks, we monitor customer inventory levels. As discussed in “Our Customers” in “Item 1. Business,” we offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to customers for performing activities on our behalf, such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new products, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices. Sales incentives and discounts also include support provided to our independent bottlers through funding of advertising and other marketing activities. A number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur after year end once reconciled and settled. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our revenue recognition and related policies, including total marketplace spending. 52 Table of Contents Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We sell products under a number of brand names, many of which were developed by us. Brand development costs are expensed as incurred. We also purchase brands and other intangible assets in acquisitions. In a business combination, the consideration is first assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities, including brands and other intangible assets, based on estimated fair values, with any excess recorded as goodwill. Determining fair value requires significant estimates and assumptions, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic, based on an evaluation of a number of factors, such as marketplace participants, product life cycles, market share, consumer awareness, brand history and future expansion expectations, amount and timing of future cash flows and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. We believe that a brand has an indefinite life if it has a history of strong revenue and cash flow performance and we have the intent and ability to support the brand with marketplace spending for the foreseeable future. If these indefinite-lived brand criteria are not met, brands are amortized over their expected useful lives, which generally range from 20 to 40 years. Determining the expected life of a brand requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors, including market share, consumer awareness, brand history, future expansion expectations and regulatory restrictions, as well as the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brand is sold. In connection with previous acquisitions, we reacquired certain franchise rights which provided the exclusive and perpetual rights to manufacture and/or distribute beverages for sale in specified territories. In determining the useful life of these franchise rights, many factors were considered, including the pre-existing perpetual bottling arrangements, the indefinite period expected for these franchise rights to contribute to our future cash flows, as well as the lack of any factors that would limit the useful life of these franchise rights to us, including legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors. Therefore, certain of these franchise rights are considered as indefinite-lived. Franchise rights that are not considered indefinite-lived are amortized over the remaining contractual period of the contract in which the right was granted. Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and, as a result, are assessed for impairment at least annually, using either a qualitative or quantitative approach. We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Where we use the qualitative assessment, first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered include macroeconomic (including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic), industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environment, historical financial performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed. In the quantitative assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, estimated fair value is determined using discounted cash flows and requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with management’s strategic business plans, annual sales growth rates, perpetuity growth assumptions and the selection of assumptions underlying a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. Significant management judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeconomic and other factors (including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic) to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, such as forecasted growth rates (including perpetuity growth assumptions) and weighted-average cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. A deterioration in these assumptions could adversely impact our results. These 53 Table of Contents assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain of the risks described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Our Business Risks.” Amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows. See Note 2 and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Income Tax Expense and Accruals Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax structure and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we likely will not succeed. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit, new tax laws, relevant court cases or tax authority settlements. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion. An estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to our quarterly operating results. In the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the same time as that item. We consider the tax adjustments from the resolution of prior-year tax matters to be among such items. Tax law requires items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our consolidated financial statements. As a result, our annual tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different than that reported in our tax returns (our cash tax rate). Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit on our consolidated financial statements. We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our consolidated financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but have not yet recognized as expense in our consolidated financial statements. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. Among its many provisions, the TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings and reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. We recorded a net tax benefit of $28 million ($0.02 per share) in 2018 related to the TCJ Act. The related provisional measurement period allowed by the SEC ended in the fourth quarter of 2018. While our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act was deemed to be complete, additional guidance issued by the IRS impacted our recorded amounts after December 29, 2018. In 2019, we recognized a net tax benefit totaling $8 million ($0.01 per share) related to the TCJ Act. See further information in “Items Affecting Comparability.” On May 19, 2019, a public referendum held in Switzerland passed the TRAF, effective January 1, 2020. The enactment of certain provisions of the TRAF resulted in adjustments to our deferred taxes. During 2020, we recorded a net tax benefit of $72 million related to the adoption of the TRAF in the 54 Table of Contents Swiss Canton of Bern. During 2019, we recorded net tax expense of $24 million related to the impact of the TRAF. In 2020, our annual tax rate was 20.9% compared to 21.0% in 2019. See “Other Consolidated Results” for further information. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Pension and Retiree Medical Plans Our pension plans cover certain employees in the United States and certain international employees. Benefits are determined based on either years of service or a combination of years of service and earnings. Certain U.S. and Canada retirees are also eligible for medical and life insurance benefits (retiree medical) if they meet age and service requirements. Generally, our share of retiree medical costs is capped at specified dollar amounts, which vary based upon years of service, with retirees contributing the remainder of the cost. In addition, we have been phasing out certain subsidies of retiree medical benefits. In 2020, lump sum distributions exceeded the total of annual service and interest cost and triggered a pre-tax settlement charge in the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan A (Plan A) of $205 million ($158 million after-tax or $0.11 per share). In 2020, we adopted an amendment to the U.S. defined benefit pension plans to freeze benefit accruals for salaried participants, effective December 31, 2025. Since 2011, salaried new hires are not eligible to participate in the defined benefit plan. After the effective date, all salaried participants will receive an employer contribution to the 401(k) savings plan based on age and years of service regardless of employee contribution and will have the opportunity to receive employer contributions to match employee contributions up to defined limits. As a result of this amendment, pension benefits pre-tax expense is expected to decrease by approximately $70 million in 2021, primarily impacting corporate unallocated expenses. In 2020, we approved an amendment to reorganize the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans that resulted in the transfer of certain participants from Plan A to the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan I (Plan I) and to a newly created plan, the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Hourly Plan (Plan H), effective January 1, 2021. The benefits offered to the plans’ participants were unchanged. The reorganization will facilitate a more targeted investment strategy and provide additional flexibility in evaluating opportunities to reduce risk and volatility. No material impact to pension benefit pre-tax expense is expected from this reorganization. In 2020, we adopted an amendment, effective January 1, 2021, to enhance the pay credit benefits of certain participants in Plan H. As a result of this amendment, pension benefits pre-tax expense is expected to increase approximately $45 million in 2021, primarily impacting service cost expense. In 2019, Plan A purchased a group annuity contract whereby a third-party insurance company assumed the obligation to pay and administer future annuity payments for certain retirees. This transaction triggered a pre-tax settlement charge in 2019 of $220 million ($170 million after-tax or $0.12 per share). Also in 2019, certain former employees who had vested benefits in our U.S. defined benefit pension plans were offered the option of receiving a one-time lump sum payment equal to the present value of the participant’s pension benefit. This transaction triggered a pre-tax settlement charge in 2019 of $53 million ($41 million after-tax or $0.03 per share). Collectively, the group annuity contract and one-time lump sum payments to certain former employees who had vested benefits resulted in settlement charges in 2019 of $273 million ($211 million after-tax or $0.15 per share). See “Items Affecting Comparability” and Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. 55 Table of Contents Our Assumptions The determination of pension and retiree medical expenses and obligations requires the use of assumptions to estimate the amount of benefits that employees earn while working, as well as the present value of those benefits. Annual pension and retiree medical expense amounts are principally based on four components: (1) the value of benefits earned by employees for working during the year (service cost), (2) the increase in the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time (interest cost), and (3) other gains and losses as discussed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, reduced by (4) the expected return on assets for our funded plans. Significant assumptions used to measure our annual pension and retiree medical expenses include: • certain employee-related demographic factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; • the expected return on assets in our funded plans; • for pension expense, the rate of salary increases for plans where benefits are based on earnings; • for retiree medical expense, health care cost trend rates; and • for pension and retiree medical expense, the spot rates along the yield curve used to determine service and interest costs and the present value of liabilities. Certain assumptions reflect our historical experience and management’s best judgment regarding future expectations. All actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually, except in the case of an interim remeasurement due to a significant event such as a curtailment or settlement. Due to the significant management judgment involved, these assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension and retiree medical expenses and obligations. At each measurement date, the discount rates are based on interest rates for high-quality, long-term corporate debt securities with maturities comparable to those of our liabilities. Our U.S. obligation and pension and retiree medical expense is based on the discount rates determined using the Mercer Above Mean Curve. This curve includes bonds that closely match the timing and amount of our expected benefit payments and reflects the portfolio of investments we would consider to settle our liabilities. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for information about the expected rate of return on plan assets and our plans’ investment strategy. Although we review our expected long-term rates of return on an annual basis, our asset returns in a given year do not significantly influence our evaluation of long-term rates of return. The health care trend rate used to determine our retiree medical plans’ obligation and expense is reviewed annually. Our review is based on our claims experience, information provided by our health plans and actuaries, and our knowledge of the health care industry. Our review of the trend rate considers factors such as demographics, plan design, new medical technologies and changes in medical carriers. 56 Table of Contents Weighted-average assumptions for pension and retiree medical expense are as follows: 2021 2020 2019 Pension Service cost discount rate 2.6 % 3.4 % 4.4 % Interest cost discount rate 1.9 % 2.8 % 3.9 % Expected rate of return on plan assets 6.2 % 6.6 % 6.8 % Expected rate of salary increases 3.1 % 3.2 % 3.2 % Retiree medical Service cost discount rate 2.3 % 3.2 % 4.3 % Interest cost discount rate 1.6 % 2.6 % 3.8 % Expected rate of return on plan assets 5.4 % 5.8 % 6.6 % Current health care cost trend rate 5.5 % 5.6 % 5.7 % In 2020, lump sum distributions exceeded the total of annual service and interest cost and triggered a pre-tax settlement charge in Plan A. In addition, based on our assumptions, we expect our total pension and retiree medical expense to decrease in 2021 primarily reflecting the recognition of fixed income gains on plan assets, the impact of discretionary plan contributions and plan changes, partially offset by lower discount rates and lower rate of expected returns on U.S. plan assets. Sensitivity of Assumptions A decrease in each of the collective discount rates or in the expected rate of return assumptions would increase expense for our benefit plans. A 25-basis-point decrease in each of the above discount rates and expected rate of return assumptions would individually increase 2021 pre-tax pension and retiree medical expense as follows: Assumption Amount Discount rates used in the calculation of expense $ 55 Expected rate of return $ 50 Funding We make contributions to pension trusts that provide plan benefits for certain pension plans. These contributions are made in accordance with applicable tax regulations that provide for current tax deductions for our contributions and taxation to the employee only upon receipt of plan benefits. Generally, we do not fund our pension plans when our contributions would not be currently tax deductible. As our retiree medical plans are not subject to regulatory funding requirements, we generally fund these plans on a pay-as-you-go basis, although we periodically review available options to make additional contributions toward these benefits. In November 2020, we received approval from our Board of Directors to make discretionary contributions of $500 million to our U.S. qualified defined benefit plans. We contributed $300 million of the approved amount in January 2021; we expect to contribute the remaining $200 million in the third quarter of 2021. We made discretionary contributions to our U.S. qualified defined benefit plans of $325 million in 2020 and $400 million in 2019. Our pension and retiree medical contributions are subject to change as a result of many factors, such as changes in interest rates, deviations between actual and expected asset returns and changes in tax or other benefit laws. We continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related global economic conditions and uncertainty on the net unfunded status of our pension and retiree medical plans. We regularly evaluate different opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for our past and expected contributions and estimated future benefit payments. 57 Table of Contents Consolidated Statement of Income PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries Fiscal years ended December 26, 2020, December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 (in millions except per share amounts) 2020 2019 2018 Net Revenue $ 70,372 $ 67,161 $ 64,661 Cost of sales 31,797 30,132 29,381 Gross profit 38,575 37,029 35,280 Selling, general and administrative expenses 28,495 26,738 25,170 Operating Profit 10,080 10,291 10,110 Other pension and retiree medical benefits income/(expense) 117 ( 44 ) 298 Net interest expense and other ( 1,128 ) ( 935 ) ( 1,219 ) Income before income taxes 9,069 9,312 9,189 Provision for/(benefit from) income taxes (See Note 5) 1,894 1,959 ( 3,370 ) Net income 7,175 7,353 12,559 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 55 39 44 Net Income Attributable to PepsiCo $ 7,120 $ 7,314 $ 12,515 Net Income Attributable to PepsiCo per Common Share Basic $ 5.14 $ 5.23 $ 8.84 Diluted $ 5.12 $ 5.20 $ 8.78 Weighted-average common shares outstanding Basic 1,385 1,399 1,415 Diluted 1,392 1,407 1,425 See accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. 58 Table of Contents Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries Fiscal years ended December 26, 2020, December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 (in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Net income $ 7,175 $ 7,353 $ 12,559 Other comprehensive (loss)/income, net of taxes: Net currency translation adjustment ( 650 ) 628 ( 1,641 ) Net change on cash flow hedges 7 ( 90 ) 40 Net pension and retiree medical adjustments ( 532 ) 283 ( 467 ) Other ( 1 ) ( 2 ) 6 ( 1,176 ) 819 ( 2,062 ) Comprehensive income 5,999 8,172 10,497 Less: Comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests 55 39 44 Comprehensive Income Attributable to PepsiCo $ 5,944 $ 8,133 $ 10,453 See accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. 59 Table of Contents Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries Fiscal years ended December 26, 2020, December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 (in millions) 2020 2019 2018 Operating Activities Net income $ 7,175 $ 7,353 $ 12,559 Depreciation and amortization 2,548 2,432 2,399 Share-based compensation expense 264 237 256 Restructuring and impairment charges 289 370 308 Cash payments for restructuring charges ( 255 ) ( 350 ) ( 255 ) Inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges 255 55 75 Cash payments for merger and integration charges ( 131 ) ( 10 ) ( 73 ) Pension and retiree medical plan expenses 408 519 221 Pension and retiree medical plan contributions ( 562 ) ( 716 ) ( 1,708 ) Deferred income taxes and other tax charges and credits 361 453 ( 531 ) Net tax related to the TCJ Act — ( 8 ) ( 28 ) Tax payments related to the TCJ Act ( 78 ) ( 423 ) ( 115 ) Other net tax benefits related to international reorganizations — ( 2 ) ( 4,347 ) Change in assets and liabilities: Accounts and notes receivable ( 420 ) ( 650 ) ( 253 ) Inventories ( 516 ) ( 190 ) ( 174 ) Prepaid expenses and other current assets 26 ( 87 ) 9 Accounts payable and other current liabilities 766 735 882 Income taxes payable ( 159 ) ( 287 ) 448 Other, net 642 218 ( 258 ) Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 10,613 9,649 9,415 Investing Activities Capital spending ( 4,240 ) ( 4,232 ) ( 3,282 ) Sales of property, plant and equipment 55 170 134 Acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and investments in noncontrolled affiliates ( 6,372 ) ( 2,717 ) ( 1,496 ) Divestitures 4 253 505 Short-term investments, by original maturity: More than three months -

See accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. 63 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 — Basis of Presentation and Our Divisions Basis of Presentation The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include the consolidated accounts of PepsiCo, Inc. and the affiliates that we control. In addition, we include our share of the results of certain other affiliates using the equity method based on our economic ownership interest, our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating or financial decisions of these affiliates or our ability to direct their economic resources. We do not control these other affiliates, as our ownership in these other affiliates is generally 50 % or less. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. As a result of exchange restrictions and other operating restrictions, we do not have control over our Venezuelan subsidiaries. As such, our Venezuelan subsidiaries are not included within our consolidated financial results for any period presented. Raw materials, direct labor and plant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, costs directly related to production planning, inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities, are included in cost of sales. The costs of moving, storing and delivering finished product, including merchandising activities, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are used in determining, among other items, sales incentives accruals, tax reserves, share-based compensation, pension and retiree medical accruals, amounts and useful lives for intangible assets and future cash flows associated with impairment testing for indefinite-lived brands, goodwill and other long-lived assets. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience, as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances, such as current economic conditions, and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change. The business and economic uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has made such estimates and assumptions more difficult to calculate. As future events and their effect cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of each December, resulting in an additional week of results every five or six years. While our North America results are reported on a weekly calendar basis, substantially all of our international operations report on a monthly calendar basis. Certain operations in our Europe segment report on a weekly calendar basis. The following chart details our quarterly reporting schedule for the three years presented: Quarter United States and Canada International First Quarter 12 weeks January, February Second Quarter 12 weeks March, April and May Third Quarter 12 weeks June, July and August Fourth Quarter 16 weeks September, October, November and December Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Certain reclassifications were made to the prior year’s consolidated financial statements to conform to the current year presentation. 64 Table of Contents Our Divisions We are organized into seven reportable segments (also referred to as divisions), as follows: 1) FLNA, which includes our branded food and snack businesses in the United States and Canada; 2) QFNA, which includes our cereal, rice, pasta and other branded food businesses in the United States and Canada; 3) PBNA, which includes our beverage businesses in the United States and Canada; 4) LatAm, which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Latin America; 5) Europe, which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Europe; 6) AMESA, which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia; and 7) APAC, which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China region. Through our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a wide variety of convenient beverages, foods and snacks, serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories with our largest operations in the United States, Mexico, Russia, Canada, the United Kingdom, China and South Africa. The accounting policies for the divisions are the same as those described in Note 2, except for the following allocation methodologies: • share-based compensation expense; • pension and retiree medical expense; and • derivatives. Share-Based Compensation Expense Our divisions are held accountable for share-based compensation expense and, therefore, this expense is allocated to our divisions as an incremental employee compensation cost. The allocation of share-based compensation expense of each division is as follows: 2020 2019 2018 FLNA 13 % 13 % 13 % QFNA 1 % 1 % 1 % PBNA 18 % 17 % 18 % LatAm 6 % 7 % 8 % Europe 16 % 17 % 9 % AMESA 6 % 3 % 4 % APAC 2 % 5 % 4 % Corporate unallocated expenses 38 % 37 % 43 % The expense allocated to our divisions excludes any impact of changes in our assumptions during the year which reflect market conditions over which division management has no control. Therefore, any variances between allocated expense and our actual expense are recognized in corporate unallocated expenses. Pension and Retiree Medical Expense Pension and retiree medical service costs measured at fixed discount rates are reflected in division results. The variance between the fixed discount rate used to determine the service cost reflected in division results and the discount rate as disclosed in Note 7 is reflected in corporate unallocated expenses. 65 Table of Contents Derivatives We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include agricultural products, energy and metals. Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in corporate unallocated expenses. These derivatives hedge underlying commodity price risk and were not entered into for trading or speculative purposes. Net Revenue and Operating Profit Net revenue and operating profit of each division are as follows: Net Revenue Operating Profit 2020 2019 2018 2020 2019 2018 FLNA $ 18,189 $ 17,078 $ 16,346 $ 5,340 $ 5,258 $ 5,008 QFNA 2,742 2,482 2,465 669 544 637 PBNA 22,559 21,730 21,072 1,937 2,179 2,276 LatAm 6,942 7,573 7,354 1,033 1,141 1,049 Europe 11,922 11,728 10,973 1,353 1,327 1,256 AMESA (a) 4,573 3,651 3,657 600 671 661 APAC (b) 3,445 2,919 2,794 590 477 619 Total division 70,372 67,161 64,661 11,522 11,597 11,506 Corporate unallocated expenses — — — ( 1,442 ) ( 1,306 ) ( 1,396 ) Total $ 70,372 $ 67,161 $ 64,661 $ 10,080 $ 10,291 $ 10,110 (a) In 2020, the increase in net revenue primarily reflects our acquisition of Pioneer Foods. See Note 14 for further information. (b) In 2020, the increase in net revenue primarily reflects our acquisition of Be & Cheery. See Note 14 for further information. Our primary performance obligation is the distribution and sales of beverage and food and snack products to our customers. The following tables reflect the approximate percentage of net revenue generated between our beverage business and our food and snack business for each of our international divisions, as well as our consolidated net revenue: 2020 2019 2018 Beverage (a) Food/Snack Beverage (a) Food/Snack Beverage (a) Food/Snack LatAm 10 % 90 % 10 % 90 % 10 % 90 % Europe 55 % 45 % 55 % 45 % 50 % 50 % AMESA (b) 30 % 70 % 40 % 60 % 45 % 55 % APAC 25 % 75 % 25 % 75 % 25 % 75 % PepsiCo 45 % 55 % 45 % 55 % 45 % 55 % (a) Beverage revenue from company-owned bottlers, which primarily includes our consolidated bottling operations in our PBNA and Europe segments, is approximately 40 % of our consolidated net revenue in 2020, 2019 and 2018. Generally, our finished goods beverage operations produce higher net revenue, but lower operating margins as compared to concentrate sold to authorized bottling partners for the manufacture of finished goods beverages. (b) The increase in the approximate percentage of net revenue generated by our food and snack business primarily reflects our acquisition of Pioneer Foods. See Note 14 for further information. 66 Table of Contents Operating profit in 2020 includes certain pre-tax charges taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Note 2 — Our Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when our performance obligation is satisfied. Our primary performance obligation (the distribution and sales of beverage products and food and snack products) is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to our customers, which is also when control is transferred. Merchandising activities are performed after a customer obtains control of the product, are accounted for as fulfillment of our performance obligation to ship or deliver product to our customers and are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Merchandising activities are immaterial in the context of our contracts. In addition, we exclude from net revenue all sales, use, value-added and certain excise taxes assessed by government authorities on revenue producing transactions. The transfer of control of products to our customers is typically based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return. However, our policy for DSD, including certain chilled products, is to remove 68 Table of Contents and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect. Similarly, our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. As a result, we record reserves, based on estimates, for anticipated damaged and out-of-date produc ts. We recorded $ 20 million of reserves for product returns in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic . See Note 1 for further information. As a result of the implementation of the revenue recognition guidance adopted in the first quarter of 2018, which did not have a material impact on our accounting policies, we recorded an adjustment in the first quarter of 2018 of $ 137 million to beginning retained earnings to reflect marketplace spending that our customers and independent bottlers expected to be entitled to in line with revenue recognition. Our products are sold for cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry practices, typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the United States, and generally within 30 to 90 days internationally, and may allow discounts for early payment. There were no material changes in credit terms as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. We estimate and reserve for our expected credit loss exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility, write-off history, the aging of accounts receivable, our analysis of customer data, and forward-looking information (including the expected impact of the global economic uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic), leveraging estimates of creditworthiness and projections of default and recovery rates for certain of our customers (including foodservice and vending businesses). We recorded an allowance for expected credit losses of $ 56 million in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. See Note 1 for further information. Expected credit loss expense is classified within selling, general and administrative expenses on our income statement. We are exposed to concentration of credit risk from our major customers, including Walmart. In 2020, sales to Walmart and its affiliates (including Sam’s) represented approximately 14 % of our consolidated net revenue, including concentrate sales to our independent bottlers, which were used in finished goods sold by them to Walmart. We have not experienced credit issues with these customers. Total Marketplace Spending We offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to customers for performing activities on our behalf, such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new products, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices. Sales incentives and discounts also include support provided to our independent bottlers through funding of advertising and other marketing activities. A number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur after year end once reconciled and settled. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred. The terms of most of our incentive arrangements do not exceed a year, and, therefore, do not require highly uncertain long-term estimates. Certain arrangements, such as fountain pouring rights, may extend beyond one year. Upfront payments to customers under these arrangements are recognized over the 69 Table of Contents shorter of the economic or contractual life, primarily as a reduction of revenue, and the remaining balances of $ 299 million as of December 26, 2020 and $ 272 million as of December 28, 2019 are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on our balance sheet. We recorded reserves of $ 59 million for upfront payments to customers in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic . See Note 1 for further information. For interim reporting, our policy is to allocate our forecasted full-year sales incentives for most of our programs to each of our interim reporting periods in the same year that benefits from the programs. The allocation methodology is based on our forecasted sales incentives for the full year and the proportion of each interim period’s actual gross revenue or volume, as applicable, to our forecasted annual gross revenue or volume, as applicable. Based on our review of the forecasts at each interim period, any changes in estimates and the related allocation of sales incentives are recognized beginning in the interim period that they are identified. In addition, we apply a similar allocation methodology for interim reporting purposes for certain advertising and other marketing activities. Our annual consolidated financial statements are not impacted by this interim allocation methodology. Advertising and other marketing activities, reported as selling, general and administrative expenses, totaled $ 4.6 billion in 2020, $ 4.7 billion in 2019 and $ 4.2 billion in 2018, including advertising expenses of $ 3.0 billion in both 2020 and 2019, and $ 2.6 billion in 2018. Deferred advertising costs are not expensed until the year first used and consist of: • media and personal service prepayments; • promotional materials in inventory; and • production costs of future media advertising. Deferred advertising costs of $ 48 million and $ 55 million as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, respectively, are classified as prepaid expenses and other current assets on our balance sheet. Distribution Costs Distribution costs, including the costs of shipping and handling activities, which include certain merchandising activities, are reported as selling, general and administrative expenses. Shipping and handling expenses were $ 11.9 billion in 2020, $ 10.9 billion in 2019 and $ 10.5 billion in 2018. Software Costs We capitalize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use when both the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable that the software will be used as intended. Capitalized software costs include (1) external direct costs of materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining computer software, (2) compensation and related benefits for employees who are directly associated with the software projects and (3) interest costs incurred while developing internal-use computer software. Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and equipment on our balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis when placed into service over the estimated useful lives of the software, which approximate five to 10 years. Software amortization totaled $ 152 million in 2020, $ 166 million in 2019 and $ 204 million in 2018. Net capitalized software and development costs were $ 664 million and $ 572 million as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, respectively. Commitments and Contingencies We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, certain taxes and environmental matters, as well as commitments under contractual and other commercial obligations. We recognize liabilities for contingencies and commitments when a loss is probable and estimable. 70 Table of Contents Research and Development We engage in a variety of research and development activities and continue to invest to accelerate growth and to drive innovation globally. Consumer research is excluded from research and development costs and included in other marketing costs. Research and development costs were $ 719 million, $ 711 million and $ 680 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and are reported within selling, general and administrative expenses. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and, as a result, are assessed for impairment at least annually, using either a qualitative or quantitative approach. We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Where we use the qualitative assessment, first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered include macroeconomic (including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic), industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environment, historical financial performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed. In the quantitative assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, an assessment is performed to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and the reporting unit, respectively. Estimated fair value is determined using discounted cash flows and requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with management’s strategic business plans, annual sales growth rates, perpetuity growth assumptions and the selection of assumptions underlying a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. Significant management judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeconomic and other factors (including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic) to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, such as forecasted growth rates (including perpetuity growth assumptions) and weighted-average cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. A deterioration in these assumptions could adversely impact our results. Amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows. See Note 4 for further information. Other Significant Accounting Policies Our other significant accounting policies are disclosed as follows: • Basis of Presentation – Note 1 includes a description of our policies regarding use of estimates, basis of presentation and consolidation. • Income Taxes – Note 5. • Share-Based Compensation – Note 6. • Pension, Retiree Medical and Savings Plans – Note 7. • Financial Instruments – Note 9. • Cash Equivalents – Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. 71 Table of Contents • Inventories – Note 15. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the average; first-in, first-out (FIFO); or, in limited instances, last-in, first-out (LIFO) methods. • Property, Plant and Equipment – Note 15. Property, plant and equipment is recorded at historical cost. Depreciation is recognized on a straight-line basis over an asset’s estimated useful life. Land is not depreciated and construction in progress is not depreciated until ready for service. • Translation of Financial Statements of Foreign Subsidiaries – Financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and weighted-average exchange rates for revenues and expenses. Adjustments resulting from translating net assets are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders’ equity as currency translation adjustment. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements - Adopted In 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance that changes the impairment model used to measure credit losses for most financial assets. Under the new model we are required to estimate expected credit losses over the life of our trade receivables, certain other receivables and certain other financial instruments. The new model replaced the existing incurred credit loss model and generally results in earlier recognition of allowances for credit losses. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2020 and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures. On initial recognition, we recorded an after-tax cumulative effect decrease to retained earnings of $ 34 million ($ 44 million pre-tax) as of the beginning of 2020. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements - Not Yet Adopted In 2019, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes. The guidance primarily addresses how to (1) recognize a deferred tax liability after we transition to or from the equity method of accounting, (2) evaluate if a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill is related to a business combination or is a separate transaction, (3) recognize all of the effects of a change in tax law in the period of enactment, including adjusting the estimated annual tax rate, and (4) include the amount of tax based on income in the income tax provision and any incremental amount as a tax not based on income for hybrid tax regimes. The guidance is effective in the first quarter of 2021 with early adoption permitted. We will adopt the guidance when it becomes effective in the first quarter of 2021. The guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or related disclosures. Note 3 — Restructuring and Impairment Charges A summary of our restructuring and impairment charges and other productivity initiatives is as follows: 2020 2019 2018 2019 Productivity Plan $ 289 $ 370 $ 138 2014 Productivity Plan — — 170 Total restructuring and impairment charges 289 370 308 Other productivity initiatives — 3 8 Total restructuring and impairment charges and other productivity initiatives $ 289 $ 373 $ 316 72 Table of Contents 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan The 2019 Productivity Plan, publicly announced on February 15, 2019, will leverage new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. In connection with this plan, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $ 2.5 billion, including cash expenditures of approximately $ 1.6 billion. These pre-tax charges are expected to consist of approximately 65 % of severance and other employee-related costs, 15 % for asset impairments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related actions and 20 % for other costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives. We expect to complete this plan by 2023. The total expected plan pre-tax charges are expected to be incurred by division approximately as follows: FLNA QFNA PBNA LatAm Europe AMESA APAC Corporate Expected pre-tax charges 15 % 1 % 30 % 10 % 25 % 5 % 3 % 11 % A summary of our 2019 Productivity Plan charges is as follows: 2020 2019 2018 Cost of sales $ 30 $ 115 $ 3 Selling, general and administrative expenses 239 253 100 Other pension and retiree medical benefits expense 20 2 35 Total restructuring and impairment charges $ 289 $ 370 $ 138 After-tax amount $ 231 $ 303 $ 109 Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share $ 0.17 $ 0.21 $ 0.08 2020 2019 2018 Plan to Date through 12/26/2020 FLNA $ 83 $ 22 $ 31 $ 136 QFNA 5 2 5 12 PBNA 47 51 40 138 LatAm 31 62 9 102 Europe 48 99 6 153 AMESA 14 38 3 55 APAC 5 47 2 54 Corporate 36 47 7 90 269 368 103 740 Other pension and retiree medical benefits expense 20 2 35 57 Total $ 289 $ 370 $ 138 $ 797 Plan to Date through 12/26/2020 Severance and other employee costs $ 444 Asset impairments 125 Other costs 228 Total $ 797 73 Table of Contents Severance and other employee costs primarily include severance and other termination benefits, as well as voluntary separation arrangements.

Substantially all of the restructuring accrual at December 26, 2020 is expected to be paid by the end of 2021. 2014 Multi-Year Productivity Plan The 2014 Productivity Plan, publicly announced on February 13, 2014, included the next generation of productivity initiatives that we believed would strengthen our beverage, food and snack businesses by: accelerating our investment in manufacturing automation; further optimizing our global manufacturing footprint, including closing certain manufacturing facilities; re-engineering our go-to-market systems in developed markets; expanding shared services; and implementing simplified organization structures to drive efficiency. To build on the 2014 Productivity Plan, in the fourth quarter of 2017, we expanded and extended the plan through the end of 2019 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives described above that further strengthened our beverage, food and snack businesses. The 2014 Productivity Plan was completed in 2019. In 2019, there were no material pre-tax charges related to this plan and all cash payments were paid at year end. The total plan pre-tax charges and cash expenditures approximated the previously disclosed plan estimates of $ 1.3 billion and $ 960 million, respectively. These total plan pre-tax charges consisted of 59 % of severance and other employee costs, 15 % of asset impairments and 26 % of other costs, including costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives, including certain consulting and other contract termination costs. These total plan pre-tax charges were incurred by division as follows: FLNA 14 %, QFNA 3 %, PBNA 29 %, LatAm 15 %, Europe 23 %, AMESA 3 %, APAC 3 % and Corporate 10 %. 74 Table of Contents A summary of our 2014 Productivity Plan charges is as follows: 2018 Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 169 Other pension and retiree medical benefits expense 1 Total restructuring and impairment charges $ 170 After-tax amount $ 143 Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share $ 0.10 2018 FLNA $ 8 QFNA 2 PBNA 51 LatAm 30 Europe 53 AMESA 15 APAC 12 Corporate (a) ( 1 ) Total $ 170 (a) Income amount primarily relates to other pension and retiree medical benefits.

We regularly evaluate different productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plans and other initiatives described above. 75 Table of Contents Note 4 — Intangible Assets A summary of our amortizable intangible assets is as follows: 2020 2019 2018 Average Useful Life (Years) Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Acquired franchise rights (a) 56 – 60 $ 976 $ ( 173 ) $ 803 $ 846 $ ( 158 ) $ 688 Customer relationships (b) 10 – 24 642 ( 204 ) 438 457 ( 177 ) 280 Brands 20 – 40 1,348 ( 1,099 ) 249 1,326 ( 1,066 ) 260 Other identifiable intangibles 10 – 24 474 ( 261 ) 213 459 ( 254 ) 205 Total $ 3,440 $ ( 1,737 ) $ 1,703 $ 3,088 $ ( 1,655 ) $ 1,433 Amortization expense $ 90 $ 81 $ 69 (a) The change in 2020 primarily reflects our distribution agreement with Vital Pharmaceuticals, Inc., with an expected residual value higher than our carrying value. The distribution agreement’s useful life is three years, in accordance with the three-year termination notice issued, and is not reflected in the average useful life above. (b) The change in 2020 primarily reflects our acquisitions of Pioneer Foods and Be & Cheery. See Note 14 for further information. Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis over an intangible asset’s estimated useful life. Amortization of intangible assets for each of the next five years, based on existing intangible assets as of December 26, 2020 and using average 2020 foreign exchange rates, is expected to be as follows: 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 Five-year projected amortization $ 92 $ 89 $ 87 $ 87 $ 84 Depreciable and amortizable assets are evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. In these circumstances, if an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on discounted future cash flows. Useful lives are periodically evaluated to determine whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate the need for revision. Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets We did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in each of the years ended December 26, 2020, December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018. In 2020, we recognized a pre-tax impairment charge of $ 41 million related to a coconut water brand in PBNA. We did not recognize any material impairment charges for indefinite-lived intangible assets in each of the years ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018. As of December 26, 2020, the estimated fair values of our indefinite-lived reacquired and acquired franchise rights recorded at PBNA exceeded their carrying values. However, there could be an impairment of the carrying value of PBNA’s reacquired and acquired franchise rights if future revenues and their contribution to the operating results of PBNA’s CSD business do not achieve our expected future cash flows or if macroeconomic conditions result in a future increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value. We have also analyzed the impact of the macroeconomic conditions in Russia on the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in Russia and have concluded that there are no impairments for the year ended December 26, 2020. However, there could be an impairment of the carrying value of certain brands in Russia, including juice and dairy brands, if there is a deterioration in these conditions, if future revenues and their contributions to the operating results do not achieve our expected future cash flows (including perpetuity growth assumptions), if there are significant changes in the decisions regarding assets that do not perform consistent with our expectations, or if macroeconomic conditions result in a future increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value.

Among its many provisions, the TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings and reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35 % to 21 %, effective January 1, 2018. In 2017, the SEC issued guidance related to the TCJ Act which allowed recording of provisional tax expense using a measurement period, not to exceed one year, when information necessary to complete the accounting for the effects of the TCJ Act is not available. We elected to apply the measurement period provisions of this guidance to certain income tax effects of the TCJ Act when it became effective in the fourth quarter of 2017. As a result of the enactment of the TCJ Act, we recognized a provisional net tax expense of $ 2.5 billion ($ 1.70 per share) in the fourth quarter of 2017. 78 Table of Contents The provisional measurement period allowed by the SEC ended in the fourth quarter of 2018. As a result, in 2018, we recognized a net tax benefit of $ 28 million ($ 0.02 per share) related to the TCJ Act. While our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act was deemed to be complete, additional guidance issued by the IRS impacted our recorded amounts after December 29, 2018. In 2019, we recognized a net tax benefit totaling $ 8 million ($ 0.01 per share) related to the TCJ Act. There were no tax amounts recognized in 2020 related to the TCJ Act. As of December 26, 2020, our mandatory transition tax liability was $ 3.2 billion, which must be paid through 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act. We reduced our liability through cash payments and application of tax overpayments by $ 78 million in 2020, $ 663 million in 2019 and $ 150 million in 2018. We currently expect to pay approximately $ 309 million of this liability in 2021. The TCJ Act also created a requirement that certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries, known as global intangible low-tax income (GILTI), must be included in the gross income of their U.S. shareholder. The FASB allows an accounting policy election of either recognizing deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or recognizing such taxes as a current-period expense when incurred. During the first quarter of 2018, we elected to treat the tax effect of GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred. Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act The CARES Act was enacted on March 27, 2020 in the United States. The CARES Act and related notices include several significant provisions, such as delaying certain payroll tax payments, mandatory transition tax payments under the TCJ Act and estimated income tax payments. The CARES Act did not have a material impact on our financial results in 2020, including on our annual estimated effective tax rate or on our liquidity. We will continue to monitor and assess the impact similar legislation in other countries may have on our business and financial results. Other Tax Matters On May 19, 2019, a public referendum held in Switzerland passed the TRAF, effective January 1, 2020. The enactment of certain provisions of the TRAF resulted in adjustments to our deferred taxes. During 2020, we recorded a net tax benefit of $ 72 million related to the adoption of the TRAF in the Swiss Canton of Bern. During 2019, we recorded net tax expense of $ 24 million related to the impact of the TRAF. While the accounting for the impacts of the TRAF are deemed to be complete, further adjustments to our financial statements and related disclosures could be made in future quarters, including in connection with final tax return filings. In 2018, we reorganized certain of our international operations, including the intercompany transfer of certain intangible assets. As a result, we recognized other net tax benefits of $ 4.3 billion ($ 3.05 per share) in 2018. The related deferred tax asset of $ 4.4 billion is being amortized over a period of 15 years beginning in 2019. Additionally, the reorganization generated significant net operating loss carryforwards and related deferred tax assets that are not expected to be realized, resulting in the recording of a full valuation allowance. 79 Table of Contents Deferred tax liabilities and assets are comprised of the following: 2020 2019 Deferred tax liabilities Debt guarantee of wholly-owned subsidiary $ 578 $ 578 Property, plant and equipment 1,851 1,583 Recapture of net operating losses 504 335 Right-of-use assets 371 345 Other 159 167 Gross deferred tax liabilities 3,463 3,008 Deferred tax assets Net carryforwards 5,008 4,168 Intangible assets other than nondeductible goodwill 1,146 793 Share-based compensation 90 94 Retiree medical benefits 153 154 Other employee-related benefits 373 350 Pension benefits 80 104 Deductible state tax and interest benefits 150 126 Lease liabilities 371 345 Other 866 741 Gross deferred tax assets 8,237 6,875 Valuation allowances ( 4,686 ) ( 3,599 ) Deferred tax assets, net 3,551 3,276 Net deferred tax assets $ ( 88 ) $ ( 268 ) A summary of our valuation allowance activity is as follows: 2020 2019 2018 Balance, beginning of year $ 3,599 $ 3,753 $ 1,163 Provision 1,082 ( 124 ) 2,639 Other additions/(deductions) 5 ( 30 ) ( 49 ) Balance, end of year $ 4,686 $ 3,599 $ 3,753 Reserves A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. Our major taxing jurisdictions and the related open tax audits are as follows: Jurisdiction Years Open to Audit Years Currently Under Audit United States 2014-2019 2014-2016 Mexico 2014-2019 2014-2016 United Kingdom 2017-2019 None Canada (Domestic) 2016-2019 2016-2017 Canada (International) 2010-2019 2010-2017 Russia 2017-2019 None 80 Table of Contents In 2018, we recognized a non-cash tax benefit of $ 364 million ($ 0.26 per share) resulting from the conclusion of certain international tax audits. Additionally, in 2018, we recognized non-cash tax benefits of $ 353 million ($ 0.24 per share) as a result of our agreement with the IRS resolving all open matters related to the audits of taxable years 2012 and 2013, including the associated state impact. The conclusion of certain international tax audits and the resolution with the IRS, collectively, resulted in non-cash tax benefits totaling $ 717 million ($ 0.50 per share) in 2018. Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning strategies and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we likely will not succeed. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit, new tax laws, relevant court cases or tax authority settlements. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate in the year of resolution. As of December 26, 2020, the total gross amount of reserves for income taxes, reported in other liabilities, was $ 1.6 billion. We accrue interest related to reserves for income taxes in our provision for income taxes and any associated penalties are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. The gross amount of interest accrued, reported in other liabilities, was $ 338 million as of December 26, 2020, of which $ 93 million of tax expense was recognized in 2020. The gross amount of interest accrued, reported in other liabilities, was $ 250 million as of December 28, 2019, of which $ 84 million of tax expense was recognized in 2019. A reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: 2020 2019 Balance, beginning of year $ 1,395 $ 1,440 Additions for tax positions related to the current year 128 179 Additions for tax positions from prior years 153 93 Reductions for tax positions from prior years ( 22 ) ( 201 ) Settlement payments ( 13 ) ( 74 ) Statutes of limitations expiration ( 23 ) ( 47 ) Translation and other 3 5 Balance, end of year $ 1,621 $ 1,395 Carryforwards and Allowances Operating loss carryforwards totaling $ 28.3 billion as of December 26, 2020 are being carried forward in a number of foreign and state jurisdictions where we are permitted to use tax operating losses from prior periods to reduce future taxable income. These operating losses will expire as follows: $ 0.2 billion in 2021, $ 25.2 billion between 2022 and 2040 and $ 2.9 billion may be carried forward indefinitely. We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Undistributed International Earnings In 2018, we repatriated $ 20.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments held in our foreign subsidiaries without such funds being subject to further U.S. federal income tax liability, related to the TCJ Act. As of December 26, 2020, we had approximately $ 6 billion of undistributed international earnings. We intend to continue to reinvest $ 6 billion of earnings outside the United States for the 81 Table of Contents foreseeable future and while future distribution of these earnings would not be subject to U.S. federal tax expense, no deferred tax liabilities with respect to items such as certain foreign exchange gains or losses, foreign withholding taxes or state taxes have been recognized. It is not practicable for us to determine the amount of unrecognized tax expense on these reinvested international earnings. Note 6 — Share-Based Compensation Our share-based compensation program is designed to attract and retain employees while also aligning employees’ interests with the interests of our shareholders. PepsiCo has granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs, PEPunits and long-term cash awards to employees under the shareholder-approved PepsiCo, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). Executives who are awarded long-term incentives based on their performance may generally elect to receive their grant in the form of stock options or RSUs, or a combination thereof. Executives who elect stock options receive four stock options for every one RSU that would have otherwise been granted. Certain executive officers and other senior executives do not have a choice and are granted 66 % PSUs and 34 % long-term cash, each of which are subject to pre-established performance targets. The Company may use authorized and unissued shares to meet share requirements resulting from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of RSUs, PSUs and PEPunits. As of December 26, 2020, 52 million shares were available for future share-based compensation grants under the LTIP. The following table summarizes our total share-based compensation expense, which is primarily recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses, and excess tax benefits recognized: 2020 2019 2018 Share-based compensation expense - equity awards $ 264 $ 237 $ 256 Share-based compensation expense - liability awards 11 8 20 Restructuring charges ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 6 ) Total $ 274 $ 243 $ 270 Income tax benefits recognized in earnings related to share-based compensation $ 48 $ 39 $ 45 Excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation $ 35 $ 50 $ 48 As of December 26, 2020, there was $ 300 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation grants. This unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of two years . Method of Accounting and Our Assumptions The fair value of share-based award grants is amortized to expense over the vesting period, primarily three years . Awards to employees eligible for retirement prior to the award becoming fully vested are amortized to expense over the period through the date that the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide service to earn the award. In addition, we use historical data to estimate forfeiture rates and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. We do not backdate, reprice or grant share-based compensation awards retroactively. Repricing of awards would require shareholder approval under the LTIP. 82 Table of Contents Stock Options A stock option permits the holder to purchase shares of PepsiCo common stock at a specified price. We account for our employee stock options under the fair value method of accounting using a Black-Scholes valuation model to measure stock option expense at the date of grant. All stock option grants have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and generally have a 10 -year term. Our weighted-average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions are as follows: 2020 2019 2018 Expected life 6 years 5 years 5 years Risk-free interest rate 0.9 % 2.4 % 2.6 % Expected volatility 14 % 14 % 12 % Expected dividend yield 3.4 % 3.1 % 2.7 % The expected life is the period over which our employee groups are expected to hold their options. It is based on our historical experience with similar grants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the expected U.S. Treasury rate over the expected life. Volatility reflects movements in our stock price over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life. Dividend yield is estimated over the expected life based on our stated dividend policy and forecasts of net income, share repurchases and stock price. A summary of our stock option activity for the year ended December 26, 2020 is as follows: Options (a) Weighted-Average Exercise Price Weighted-Average Contractual Life Remaining (years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (a) Outstanding at December 28, 2019 11,625 $ 89.03 Granted 1,847 $ 131.79 Exercised ( 2,440 ) $ 73.37 Forfeited/expired ( 392 ) $ 102.69 Outstanding at December 26, 2020 10,640 $ 99.54 5.26 $ 484,362 Exercisable at December 26, 2020 6,545 $ 85.84 3.31 $ 387,625 Expected to vest as of December 26, 2020 3,719 $ 120.67 8.31 $ 90,725 (a) In thousands. Restricted Stock Units and Performance Stock Units Each RSU represents our obligation to deliver to the holder one share of PepsiCo common stock when the award vests at the end of the service period. PSUs are awards pursuant to which a number of shares are delivered to the holder upon vesting at the end of the service period based on PepsiCo’s performance against specified financial performance metrics. The number of shares may be increased to the maximum or reduced to the minimum threshold based on the results of these performance metrics in accordance with the terms established at the time of the award. During the vesting period, RSUs and PSUs accrue dividend equivalents that pay out in cash (without interest) if and when the applicable RSU or PSU vests and becomes payable. The fair value of RSUs and PSUs are measured at the market price of the Company’s stock on the date of grant. 83 Table of Contents A summary of our RSU and PSU activity for the year ended December 26, 2020 is as follows: RSUs/PSUs (a) Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value Weighted-Average Contractual Life Remaining (years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (a) Outstanding at December 28, 2019 6,380 $ 111.53 Granted (b) 2,496 $ 131.21 Converted (c) ( 2,315 ) $ 109.61 Forfeited ( 434 ) $ 117.51 Outstanding at December 26, 2020 (d) 6,127 $ 119.92 1.27 $ 888,832 Expected to vest as of December 26, 2020 5,447 $ 119.72 1.26 $ 790,179 (a) In thousands.

(d) The outstanding PSUs for which the vesting period has not ended as of December 26, 2020, at the threshold, target and maximum award levels were zero , 1 million and 2 million, respectively. PEPunits PEPunits provide an opportunity to earn shares of PepsiCo common stock with a value that adjusts based upon changes in PepsiCo’s absolute stock price as well as PepsiCo’s Total Shareholder Return relative to the S&P 500 over a three-year performance period. The fair value of PEPunits is measured using the Monte-Carlo simulation model, which incorporates into the fair-value determination the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied until actual performance is determined. PEPunits were last granted in 2015 and all outstanding PEPunits were converted to 278,000 shares in 2018. Long-Term Cash Certain executive officers and other senior executives were granted long-term cash awards for which final payout is based on PepsiCo’s Total Shareholder Return relative to a specific set of peer companies and achievement of a specified performance target over a three-year performance period. Long-term cash awards that qualify as liability awards under share-based compensation guidance are valued through the end of the performance period on a mark-to-market basis using the Monte Carlo simulation model. 84 Table of Contents A summary of our long-term cash activity for the year ended December 26, 2020 is as follows: Long-Term Cash Award (a) Balance Sheet Date Fair Value (a) Contractual Life Remaining (years) Outstanding at December 28, 2019 $ 44,224 Granted (b) 18,975 Vested (c) ( 15,686 ) Forfeited — Outstanding at December 26, 2020 (d) $ 47,513 $ 45,669 1.23 Expected to vest as of December 26, 2020 $ 42,658 $ 41,318 1.14 (a) In thousands.

As of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, there were approximately 287,000 and 269,000 outstanding awards, respectively, consisting primarily of phantom stock units that were granted under the PepsiCo Director Deferral Program and will be settled in shares of PepsiCo common stock pursuant to the LTIP at the end of the applicable deferral period, not included in the tables above. 85 Table of Contents Note 7 — Pension, Retiree Medical and Savings Plans In 2020, lump sum distributions exceeded the total of annual service and interest cost and triggered a pre-tax settlement charge in Plan A of $ 205 million ($ 158 million after-tax or $ 0.11 per share). In 2020, we adopted an amendment to the U.S. defined benefit pension plans to freeze benefit accruals for salaried participants, effective December 31, 2025. Since 2011, salaried new hires are not eligible to participate in the defined benefit plan. After the effective date, all salaried participants will receive an employer contribution to the 401(k) savings plan based on age and years of service regardless of employee contribution and will have the opportunity to receive employer contributions to match employee contributions up to defined limits. As a result of this amendment, pension benefits pre-tax expense is expected to decrease by approximately $ 70 million in 2021, primarily impacting corporate unallocated expenses. In 2020, we approved an amendment to reorganize the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans that resulted in the transfer of certain participants from Plan A to Plan I and to a newly created plan, Plan H, effective January 1, 2021. The benefits offered to the plans’ participants were unchanged. The reorganization will facilitate a more targeted investment strategy and provide additional flexibility in evaluating opportunities to reduce risk and volatility. No material impact to pension benefit pre-tax expense is expected from this reorganization. In 2020, we adopted an amendment, effective January 1, 2021, to enhance the pay credit benefits of certain participants in Plan H. As a result of this amendment, pension benefits pre-tax expense is expected to increase approximately $ 45 million in 2021, primarily impacting service cost expense. In 2019, Plan A purchased a group annuity contract whereby a third-party insurance company assumed the obligation to pay and administer future annuity payments for certain retirees. This transaction triggered a pre-tax settlement charge in 2019 of $ 220 million ($ 170 million after-tax or $ 0.12 per share). Also in 2019, certain former employees who had vested benefits in our U.S. defined benefit pension plans were offered the option of receiving a one-time lump sum payment equal to the present value of the participant’s pension benefit. This transaction triggered a pre-tax settlement charge in 2019 of $ 53 million ($ 41 million after-tax or $ 0.03 per share). Collectively, the group annuity contract and one-time lump sum payments to certain former employees who had vested benefits resulted in settlement charges in 2019 of $ 273 million ($ 211 million after-tax or $ 0.15 per share). Gains and losses resulting from actual experience differing from our assumptions, including the difference between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets, as well as changes in our assumptions, are determined at each measurement date. These differences are recognized as a component of net gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss. If this net accumulated gain or loss exceeds 10 % of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or plan obligations, a portion of the net gain or loss is included in other pension and retiree medical benefits (expense)/income for the following year based upon the average remaining service life for participants in Plan A (approximately 10 years ) and retiree medical (approximately 8 years), or the remaining life expectancy for participants in Plan I (approximately 23 years). In 2021, we expect the average remaining service life for participants in Plan A to be approximately 9 years , the remaining life expectancy for participants in Plan I to be approximately 27 years and the average remaining service life for participants in Plan H to be approximately 11 years . The cost or benefit of plan changes that increase or decrease benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost/(credit)) is included in other pension and retiree medical benefits (expense)/income on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service life for participants in both Plan A and Plan H, except that prior service cost/(credit) for salaried participants subject to the freeze will be amortized on a 86 Table of Contents straight-line basis over the period up to the effective date of the freeze, or the remaining life expectancy for participants in Plan I.

The amounts we report below operating profit as pension and retiree medical cost consist of the following components: • Interest cost is the accrued interest on the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time. • Expected return on plan assets is the long-term return we expect to earn on plan investments for our funded plans that will be used to settle future benefit obligations. • Amortization of prior service cost/(credit) represents the recognition in the income statement of benefit changes resulting from plan amendments. • Amortization of net loss/(gain) represents the recognition in the income statement of changes in the amount of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation based on changes in assumptions and actual experience. • Settlement/curtailment loss/(gain) represents the result of actions that effectively eliminate all or a portion of related projected benefit obligations. Settlements are triggered when payouts to settle the projected benefit obligation of a plan due to lump sums or other events exceed the annual service and interest cost. Settlements are recognized when actions are irrevocable and we are relieved of the primary responsibility and risk for projected benefit obligations. Lump sum payouts are generally higher when interest rates are lower. Curtailments are due to events such as plant closures or the sale of a business resulting in a reduction of future service or benefits. Curtailment losses are recognized when an event is probable and estimable, while curtailment gains are recognized when an event has occurred (when the related employees terminate or an amendment is adopted). • Special termination benefits are the additional benefits offered to employees upon departure due to actions such as restructuring. The components of total pension and retiree medical benefit costs are as follows: Pension Retiree Medical U.S. International 2020 2019 2018 2020 2019 2018 2020 2019 2018 Service cost $ 434 $ 381 $ 431 $ 86 $ 73 $ 92 $ 25 $ 23 $ 32 Other pension and retiree medical benefits (income)/expense: Interest cost $ 435 $ 543 $ 482 $ 85 $ 97 $ 93 $ 25 $ 36 $ 34 Expected return on plan assets ( 929 ) ( 892 ) ( 943 ) ( 202 ) ( 188 ) ( 197 ) ( 16 ) ( 18 ) ( 19 ) Amortization of prior service cost/(credits) 12 10 3 — — — ( 12 ) ( 19 ) ( 20 ) Amortization of net losses/(gains) 196 161 179 61 32 45 ( 23 ) ( 27 ) ( 8 ) Settlement/curtailment losses (a) 213 296 8 19 12 6 — — — Special termination benefits 19 1 36 — — 2 — — 1 Total other pension and retiree medical benefits (income)/expense $ ( 54 ) $ 119 $ ( 235 ) $ ( 37 ) $ ( 47 ) $ ( 51 ) $ ( 26 ) $ ( 28 ) $ ( 12 ) Total $ 380 $ 500 $ 196 $ 49 $ 26 $ 41 $ ( 1 ) $ ( 5 ) $ 20 (a) In 2020, U.S. includes a settlement charge of $ 205 million ($ 158 million after-tax or $ 0.11 per share) related to lump sum distributions exceeding the total of annual service and interest cost.

Of the total projected pension benefit obligation as of December 26, 2020, approximately $ 854 million relates to plans that we do not fund because the funding of such plans does not receive favorable tax treatment. Future Benefit Payments Our estimated future benefit payments are as follows: 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 - 2030 Pension $ 925 $ 1,080 $ 915 $ 960 $ 990 $ 5,270 Retiree medical (a) $ 95 $ 95 $ 90 $ 85 $ 80 $ 370 (a) Expected future benefit payments for our retiree medical plans do not reflect any estimated subsidies expected to be received under the 2003 Medicare Act. Subsidies are expected to be approximately $ 1 million for each of the years from 2021 through 2025 and approximately $ 4 million in total for 2026 through 2030. These future benefit payments to beneficiaries include payments from both funded and unfunded plans. 89 Table of Contents Funding Contributions to our pension and retiree medical plans were as follows: Pension Retiree Medical 2020 2019 2018 2020 2019 2018 Discretionary (a) $ 339 $ 417 $ 1,417 $ — $ — $ 37 Non-discretionary 168 255 198 55 44 56 Total $ 507 $ 672 $ 1,615 $ 55 $ 44 $ 93 (a) Includes $ 325 million contribution in 2020, $ 400 million contribution in 2019 and $ 1.4 billion contribution in 2018 to fund Plan A in the United States. In November 2020, we received approval from our Board of Directors to make discretionary contributions of $ 500 million to our U.S. qualified defined benefit plans. We contributed $ 300 million of the approved amount in January 2021; we expect to contribute the remaining $ 200 million in the third quarter of 2021. In addition, in 2021, we expect to make non-discretionary contributions of approximately $ 160 million to our U.S. and international pension benefit plans and approximately $ 50 million for retiree medical benefits. We continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and related global economic conditions and uncertainty on the net unfunded status of our pension and retiree medical plans. We regularly evaluate opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans. Plan Assets Our pension plan investment strategy includes the use of actively managed accounts and is reviewed periodically in conjunction with plan obligations, an evaluation of market conditions, tolerance for risk and cash requirements for benefit payments. This strategy is also applicable to funds held for the retiree medical plans. Our investment objective includes ensuring that funds are available to meet the plans’ benefit obligations when they become due. Assets contributed to our pension plans are no longer controlled by us, but become the property of our individual pension plans. However, we are indirectly impacted by changes in these plan assets as compared to changes in our projected obligations. Our overall investment policy is to prudently invest plan assets in a well-diversified portfolio of equity and high-quality debt securities and real estate to achieve our long-term return expectations. Our investment policy also permits the use of derivative instruments, such as futures and forward contracts, to reduce interest rate and foreign currency risks. Futures contracts represent commitments to purchase or sell securities at a future date and at a specified price. Forward contracts consist of currency forwards. For 2021 and 2020, our expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets is 6.4 % and 6.8 %, respectively. Our target investment allocations for U.S. plan assets are as follows: 2021 2020 Fixed income 51 % 50 % U.S. equity 24 % 25 % International equity 21 % 21 % Real estate 4 % 4 % Actual investment allocations may vary from our target investment allocations due to prevailing market conditions. We regularly review our actual investment allocations and periodically rebalance our investments. The expected return on plan assets is based on our investment strategy and our expectations for long-term rates of return by asset class, taking into account volatility and correlation among asset classes and our historical experience. We also review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the 90 Table of Contents reasonableness of the long-term rates. We evaluate our expected return assumptions annually to ensure that they are reasonable. To calculate the expected return on plan assets, our market-related value of assets for fixed income is the actual fair value. For all other asset categories, such as equity securities, we use a method that recognizes investment gains or losses (the difference between the expected and actual return based on the market-related value of assets) over a five-year period. This has the effect of reducing year-to-year volatility. Plan assets measured at fair value as of year-end 2020 and 2019 are categorized consistently by Level 1 (quoted prices in active markets for identical assets), Level 2 (significant other observable inputs) and Level 3 (significant unobservable inputs) in both years and are as follows: Fair Value Hierarchy Level 2020 2019 U.S. plan assets (a) Equity securities, including preferred stock (b) 1 $ 7,179 $ 6,605 Government securities (c) 2 2,177 2,154 Corporate bonds (c) 2 5,437 4,737 Mortgage-backed securities (c) 2 119 159 Contracts with insurance companies (d) 3 9 9 Cash and cash equivalents (e) 1, 2 278 275 Sub-total U.S. plan assets 15,199 13,939 Real estate commingled funds measured at net asset value (f) 517 605 Dividends and interest receivable, net of payables 64 60 Total U.S. plan assets $ 15,780 $ 14,604 International plan assets Equity securities (b) 1, 2 $ 2,119 $ 1,973 Government securities (c) 2 937 725 Corporate bonds (c) 2 445 331 Fixed income commingled funds (g) 1 509 437 Contracts with insurance companies (d) 3 50 42 Cash and cash equivalents 1 33 24 Sub-total international plan assets 4,093 3,532 Real estate commingled funds measured at net asset value (f) 202 193 Dividends and interest receivable 8 7 Total international plan assets $ 4,303 $ 3,732 (a) Includes $ 315 million and $ 302 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, of retiree medical plan assets that are restricted for purposes of providing health benefits for U.S. retirees and their beneficiaries. (b) Invested in U.S. and international common stock and commingled funds, and the preferred stock portfolio was invested in domestic and international corporate preferred stock investments. The common stock is based on quoted prices in active markets. The commingled funds are based on the published price of the fund and include one large-cap fund that represents 13 % and 16 % of total U.S. plan assets for 2020 and 2019, respectively. The preferred stock investments are based on quoted bid prices for comparable securities in the marketplace and broker/dealer quotes in active markets. The international portfolio includes Level 1 assets of $ 2,119 million and $ 1,941 million for 2020 and 2019, respectively, and Level 2 assets of $ 32 million for 2019. (c) These investments are based on quoted bid prices for comparable securities in the marketplace and broker/dealer quotes in active markets. Corporate bonds of U.S.-based companies represent 30 % and 28 % of total U.S. plan assets for 2020 and 2019, respectively. (d) Based on the fair value of the contracts as determined by the insurance companies using inputs that are not observable. The changes in Level 3 amounts were not significant in the years ended December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019.

(f) The real estate commingled funds include investments in limited partnerships. These funds are based on the net asset value of the appraised value of investments owned by these funds as determined by independent third parties using inputs that are not observable. The majority of the funds are redeemable quarterly subject to availability of cash and have notice periods ranging from 45 to 90 days.

Savings Plan Certain U.S. employees are eligible to participate in a 401(k) savings plan, which is a voluntary defined contribution plan. The plan is designed to help employees accumulate savings for retirement and we make Company matching contributions for certain employees on a portion of employee contributions based on years of service. Certain U.S. salaried employees, who are not eligible to participate in a defined benefit pension plan, are also eligible to receive an employer contribution based on age and years of service regardless of employee contribution. In 2020, 2019 and 2018, our total Company contributions were $ 225 million, $ 197 million and $ 180 million, respectively.

(b) The interest rates presented reflect weighted-average effective interest rates at year-end. Certain of our fixed rate indebtedness have been swapped to floating rates through the use of interest rate derivative instruments. See Note 9 for further information regarding our interest rate derivative instruments. 92 Table of Contents As of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, our international debt of $ 29 million and $ 69 million, respectively, was related to borrowings from external parties, including various lines of credit. These lines of credit are subject to normal banking terms and conditions and are fully committed at least to the extent of our borrowings. In 2020, we issued the following senior notes: Interest Rate Maturity Date Amount (a) 2.250 % March 2025 $ 1,500 2.625 % March 2027 $ 500 2.750 % March 2030 $ 1,500 3.500 % March 2040 $ 750 3.625 % March 2050 $ 1,500 3.875 % March 2060 $ 750 0.750 % May 2023 $ 1,000 1.625 % May 2030 $ 1,000 0.250 % May 2024 € 1,000 0.500 % May 2028 € 1,000 0.400 % October 2023 $ 750 1.400 % February 2031 $ 750 0.400 % October 2032 € 750 1.050 % October 2050 € 750 (a) Represents gross proceeds from issuances of long-term debt excluding debt issuance costs, discounts and premiums. The net proceeds from the issuances of the above notes will be used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper. In 2020, we entered into a new 364-day unsecured revolving credit agreement (364-Day Credit Agreement) which expires on May 31, 2021. The 364-Day Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $ 3.75 billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros, subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $ 4.5 billion in U.S dollars and/or euros. We may request renewal of this facility for an additional 364-day period or convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year, which term loan would mature no later than the anniversary of the then effective termination date. The 364-Day Credit Agreement replaced our $ 3.75 billion 364-day credit agreement, dated as of June 3, 2019. The 364-Day Credit Agreement is in addition to the five-year unsecured revolving credit agreement (Five-Year Credit Agreement) we entered into in 2019, and which expires on June 3, 2024. The Five-Year Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $ 3.75 billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros, including a $ 0.75 billion swing line subfacility for euro-denominated borrowings permitted to be borrowed on a same-day basis, subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $ 4.5 billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros. Additionally, we may, once a year, request renewal of the agreement for an additional one-year period. Funds borrowed under the 364-Day Credit Agreement and Five-Year Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. Subject to certain conditions, we may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts under these agreements. As of December 26, 2020, there were no outstanding borrowings under the 364-Day Credit Agreement or the Five-Year Credit Agreement. In 2020, one of our international consolidated subsidiaries borrowed 21.7 billion South African rand, or approximately $ 1.3 billion, from our two unsecured bridge loan facilities (Bridge Loan Facilities) to fund 93 Table of Contents our acquisition of Pioneer Foods. These borrowings were fully repaid in April 2020 and no further borrowings under these Bridge Loan Facilities are permitted. In 2020, we paid $ 1.1 billion to redeem all $ 1.1 billion outstanding principal amount of our 2.15 % senior notes due 2020 and terminated associated interest rate swaps with a notional amount of $ 0.8 billion. In 2019, we paid $ 1.0 billion to redeem all $ 1.0 billion outstanding principal amount of our 4.50 % senior notes due 2020. In 2018, we completed a cash tender offer to redeem $ 1.3 billion of certain notes issued by PepsiCo and predecessors to a PepsiCo subsidiary for $ 1.6 billion in cash. Also in 2018, we completed an exchange offer for certain notes issued by predecessors to a PepsiCo subsidiary for newly issued PepsiCo notes. These notes were issued in an aggregate principal amount of $ 732 million, equal to the exchanged notes. As a result of the above transactions, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $ 253 million ($ 191 million after-tax or $ 0.13 per share) to interest expense in 2018, primarily representing the tender price paid over the carrying value of the tendered notes. Note 9 — Financial Instruments Derivatives and Hedging We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in: • commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy; • foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and • interest rates. In the normal course of business, we manage commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of strategies, including productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs and hedging. Ongoing productivity initiatives involve the identification and effective implementation of meaningful cost-saving opportunities or efficiencies, including the use of derivatives. We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. Our global purchasing programs include fixed-price contracts and purchase orders and pricing agreements. Our hedging strategies include the use of derivatives and, in the case of our net investment hedges, debt instruments. Certain derivatives are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment, while others do not qualify and are marked to market through earnings. The accounting for qualifying hedges allows changes in a hedging instrument’s fair value to offset corresponding changes in the hedged item in the same reporting period that the hedged item impacts earnings. Gains or losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified to our income statement when the hedged transaction affects earnings. If it becomes probable that the hedged transaction will not occur, we immediately recognize the related hedging gains or losses in earnings; such gains or losses reclassified during the year ended December 26, 2020 were not material. Cash flows from derivatives used to manage commodity price, foreign exchange or interest rate risks are classified as operating activities in the cash flow statement. We classify both the earnings and cash flow impact from these derivatives consistent with the underlying hedged item. Credit Risk We perform assessments of our counterparty credit risk regularly, including reviewing netting agreements, if any, and a review of credit ratings, credit default swap rates and potential nonperformance of the counterparty. Based on our most recent assessment of our counterparty credit risk, we consider this risk to 94 Table of Contents be low. In addition, we enter into derivative contracts with a variety of financial institutions that we believe are creditworthy in order to reduce our concentration of credit risk. Certain of our agreements with our counterparties require us to post full collateral on derivative instruments in a net liability position if our credit rating is at A2 (Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.) or A (S&P Global Ratings) and we have been placed on credit watch for possible downgrade or if our credit rating falls below these levels. The fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position as of December 26, 2020 was $ 283 million. We have posted no collateral under these contracts and no credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered as of December 26, 2020. Commodity Prices We are subject to commodity price risk because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited in the competitive environment in which we operate. This risk is managed through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, which primarily include swaps and futures. In addition, risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. We use derivatives, with terms of no more than three years , to hedge price fluctuations related to a portion of our anticipated commodity purchases, primarily for agricultural products, energy and metals. Derivatives used to hedge commodity price risk that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Our commodity derivatives had a total notional value of $ 1.1 billion as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019. Foreign Exchange We are exposed to foreign exchange risks in the international markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. Additionally, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency purchases and foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. We manage this risk through sourcing purchases from local suppliers, negotiating contracts in local currencies with foreign suppliers and through the use of derivatives, primarily forward contracts with terms of no more than two years . Exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions are recognized as transaction gains or losses on our income statement as incurred. We also use net investment hedges to partially offset the effects of foreign currency on our investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries. Our foreign currency derivatives had a total notional value of $ 1.9 billion as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019. The total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was $ 2.7 billion as of December 26, 2020 and $ 2.5 billion as of December 28, 2019. For foreign currency derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, gains and losses were offset by changes in the underlying hedged items, resulting in no material net impact on earnings. Interest Rates We centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks, tax consequences and overall financing strategies. We use various interest rate derivative instruments including, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps, Treasury locks and 95 Table of Contents swap locks to manage our overall interest expense and foreign exchange risk. These instruments effectively change the interest rate and currency of specific debt issuances. Certain of our fixed rate indebtedness have been swapped to floating rates. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt. Our cross-currency interest rate swaps have terms of no more than twelve years . Our Treasury locks and swap locks are entered into to protect against unfavorable interest rate changes relating to forecasted debt transactions. Our interest rate derivatives had a total notional value of $ 3.0 billion as of December 26, 2020 and $ 5.0 billion as of December 28, 2019. As of December 26, 2020, approximately 3 % of total debt, after the impact of the related interest rate derivative instruments, was subject to variable rates, compared to approximately 9 % as of December 28, 2019. Held-to-Maturity Debt Securities Investments in debt securities that we have the positive intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held-to-maturity. Highly liquid debt securities with original maturities of three months or less are recorded as cash equivalents. Our held-to-maturity debt securities consist of U.S. Treasury securities and commercial paper. As of December 26, 2020, we had $ 2.1 billion of investments in U.S. Treasury securities with $ 2.0 billion recorded in cash and cash equivalents and $ 0.1 billion in short-term investments. We had no investments in U.S. Treasury securities as of December 28, 2019. As of December 26, 2020, we had $ 260 million of investments in commercial paper with $ 75 million recorded in cash and cash equivalents and $ 185 million in short-term investments. As of December 28, 2019, we had $ 130 million of investments in commercial paper recorded in cash and cash equivalents. Held-to-maturity debt securities are recorded at amortized cost, which approximates fair value, and realized gains or losses are reported in earnings. Our investments mature in less than one year. As of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, gross unrecognized gains and losses and the allowance for expected credit losses were not material. 96 Table of Contents Fair Value Measurements The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 are categorized as follows: 2020 2019 Fair Value Hierarchy Levels (a) Assets (a) Liabilities (a) Assets (a) Liabilities (a) Index funds (b) 1 $ 231 $ — $ 229 $ — Prepaid forward contracts (c) 2 $ 18 $ — $ 17 $ — Deferred compensation (d) 2 $ — $ 477 $ — $ 468 Contingent consideration (e) 3 $ — $ 861 $ — $ — Derivatives designated as fair value hedging instruments: Interest rate (f) 2 $ 2 $ — $ — $ 5 Derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments: Foreign exchange (g) 2 $ 9 $ 71 $ 5 $ 32 Interest rate (g) 2 13 307 — 390 Commodity (h) 1 — — 2 5 Commodity (i) 2 32 — 2 5 $ 54 $ 378 $ 9 $ 432 Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Foreign exchange (g) 2 $ 4 $ 8 $ 3 $ 2 Commodity (h) 1 — — 23 7 Commodity (i) 2 19 7 6 24 $ 23 $ 15 $ 32 $ 33 Total derivatives at fair value (j) $ 79 $ 393 $ 41 $ 470 Total $ 328 $ 1,731 $ 287 $ 938 (a) Fair value hierarchy levels are defined in Note 7. Unless otherwise noted, financial assets are classified on our balance sheet within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets. Financial liabilities are classified on our balance sheet within accounts payable and other current liabilities and other liabilities. (b) Based on the price of index funds. These investments are classified as short-term investments and are used to manage a portion of market risk arising from our deferred compensation liability. (c) Based primarily on the price of our common stock. (d) Based on the fair value of investments corresponding to employees’ investment elections. (e) In connection with our acquisition of Rockstar, we recorded a liability for tax-related contingent consideration payable over up to 15 years, with an option to accelerate all remaining payments, with estimated maximum payments of approximately $ 1.1 billion, using current tax rates. The fair value of the liability is estimated using probability-weighted, discounted future cash flows at current tax rates. The significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) used to estimate the fair value include the expected future tax benefits associated with the acquisition, the probability that the option to accelerate all remaining payments will be exercised and discount rates. The expected annual future tax benefits range from approximately $ 40 million to $ 110 million, with an average of $ 70 million. The probability, in any given year, that the option to accelerate will be exercised ranges from 3 to 25 percent, with a weighted-average payment period of approximately 4 years. The discount rates range from less than 1 percent to 5 percent, with a weighted average of 3 percent. The contingent consideration measured at fair value using unobservable inputs as of December 26, 2020 is $ 861 million, comprised of an $ 882 million liability recognized at the acquisition date of Rockstar and a fair value decrease of $ 21 million in the year ended December 26, 2020, recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. (f) Based on London Interbank Offered Rate forward rates. As of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, the carrying amount of hedged fixed-rate debt was $ 0.2 billion and $ 2.2 billion, respectively, and classified on our balance sheet within short-term and long-term debt obligations. As of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments to hedged fixed-rate debt was a $ 2 million gain and $ 5 million loss, respectively. As of December 26, 2020, the cumulative amount of fair value hedging adjustments on discontinued hedges was a $ 19 million loss, which is being amortized over the remaining life of the related debt obligations. 97 Table of Contents (g) Based on recently reported market transactions of spot and forward rates. (h) Based on quoted contract prices on futures exchange markets. (i) Based on recently reported market transactions of swap arrangements. (j) Derivative assets and liabilities are presented on a gross basis on our balance sheet. Amounts subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements which are not offset on the balance sheet as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 were not material. Collateral received or posted against our asset or liability positions was not material. Exchange-traded commodity futures are cash-settled on a daily basis and, therefore, not included in the table as of December 26, 2020. The carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments approximate fair value due to their short-term maturity. Our cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of our debt obligations as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019 was $ 50 billion and $ 34 billion, respectively, based upon prices of similar instruments in the marketplace, which are considered Level 2 inputs. Losses/(gains) on our hedging instruments are categorized as follows: Fair Value/Non- designated Hedges Cash Flow and Net Investment Hedges Losses/(Gains) Recognized in Income Statement (a) Losses/(Gains) Recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Losses/(Gains) Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss into Income Statement (b) 2020 2019 2020 2019 2020 2019 Foreign exchange $ — $ ( 1 ) $ ( 9 ) $ 57 $ ( 43 ) $ 3 Interest rate ( 6 ) ( 64 ) ( 96 ) 67 ( 129 ) 7 Commodity 53 ( 17 ) ( 21 ) 7 56 4 Net investment — — 235 ( 30 ) — — Total $ 47 $ ( 82 ) $ 109 $ 101 $ ( 116 ) $ 14 (a) Foreign exchange derivative losses/gains are primarily included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Interest rate derivative losses/gains are primarily from fair value hedges and are included in net interest expense and other. These losses/gains are substantially offset by decreases/increases in the value of the underlying debt, which are also included in net interest expense and other. Commodity derivative losses/gains are included in either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. (b) Foreign exchange derivative losses/gains are included in cost of sales. Interest rate derivative losses/gains are included in net interest expense and other. Commodity derivative losses/gains are included in either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. Based on current market conditions, we expect to reclassify net losses of $ 7 million related to our cash flow hedges from accumulated other comprehensive loss into net income during the next 12 months. 98 Table of Contents Note 10 — Net Income Attributable to PepsiCo per Common Share The computations of basic and diluted net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share are as follows: 2020 2019 2018 Income Shares (a) Income Shares (a) Income Shares (a) Net income attributable to PepsiCo $ 7,120 $ 7,314 $ 12,515 Preferred stock: Redemption premium (b) — — ( 2 ) Net income available for PepsiCo common shareholders $ 7,120 1,385 $ 7,314 1,399 $ 12,513 1,415 Basic net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share $ 5.14 $ 5.23 $ 8.84 Net income available for PepsiCo common shareholders $ 7,120 1,385 $ 7,314 1,399 $ 12,513 1,415 Dilutive securities: Stock options, RSUs, PSUs and other (c) — 7 — 8 — 10 Employee stock ownership plan (ESOP) convertible preferred stock — — — — 2 — Diluted $ 7,120 1,392 $ 7,314 1,407 $ 12,515 1,425 Diluted net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share $ 5.12 $ 5.20 $ 8.78 (a) Weighted-average common shares outstanding (in millions).

We have operating leases for plants, warehouses, distribution centers, storage facilities, offices and other facilities, as well as machinery and equipment, including fleet. Our leases generally have remaining lease terms of up to 20 years, some of which include options to extend the lease term for up to five years, and some of which include options to terminate the lease within one year . We consider these options in determining the lease term used to establish our right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. We have lease agreements that contain both lease and non-lease components. For real estate leases, we account for lease components together with non-lease components (e.g., common-area maintenance). 101 Table of Contents Components of lease cost are as follows: 2020 2019 Operating lease cost (a) $ 539 $ 474 Variable lease cost (b) $ 111 $ 101 Short-term lease cost (c) $ 436 $ 379 (a) Includes right-of-use asset amortization of $ 478 million and $ 412 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. (b) Primarily related to adjustments for inflation, common-area maintenance and property tax. (c) Not recorded on our balance sheet. Rent expense for the year ended December 29, 2018 was $ 771 million. In 2020 and 2019, we recognized gains of $ 7 million and $ 77 million, respectively, on sale-leaseback transactions with terms under four years. Supplemental cash flow information and non-cash activity related to our operating leases are as follows: 2020 2019 Operating cash flow information: Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities $ 555 $ 478 Non-cash activity: Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations $ 621 $ 479 Supplemental balance sheet information related to our operating leases is as follows: Balance Sheet Classification 2020 2019 Right-of-use assets Other assets $ 1,670 $ 1,548 Current lease liabilities Accounts payable and other current liabilities $ 460 $ 442 Non-current lease liabilities Other liabilities $ 1,233 $ 1,118 Weighted-average remaining lease term and discount rate for our operating leases are as follows: 2020 2019 Weighted-average remaining lease term 6 years 6 years Weighted-average discount rate 4 % 4 % Maturities of lease liabilities by year for our operating leases are as follows: 2021 $ 486 2022 385 2023 278 2024 194 2025 139 2026 and beyond 413 Total lease payments 1,895 Less: Imputed interest ( 202 ) Present value of lease liabilities $ 1,693 Lessor We have various arrangements for certain foodservice and vending equipment under which we are the lessor.

The total consideration transferred was $ 3.3 billion (or $ 3.2 billion, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired). The purchase price allocation was finalized in the fourth quarter of 2019. Refranchising in Thailand In 2018, we refranchised our beverage business in Thailand by selling a controlling interest in our Thailand bottling operations to form a joint venture, where we now have an equity method investment. We recorded a pre-tax gain of $ 144 million ($ 126 million after-tax or $ 0.09 per share) in selling, general and administrative expenses in our APAC segment as a result of this transaction. Refranchising in Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia In 2018, we refranchised our entire beverage bottling operations and snack distribution operations in Czech Republic, Hungary and Slovakia.

We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 26, 2020 and December 28, 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 26, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As permitted by SEC guidance, the scope of management's assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2020 excluded Pioneer Food Group Ltd. and its subsidiaries (Pioneer Foods) and Hangzhou Haomusi Food Co., Ltd. and its subsidiaries (Be & Cheery), both of which the Company acquired in 2020. Pioneer Foods’ total assets and net revenue represented approximately 2.2% and 1.4%, respectively, of the consolidated total assets and net revenue of the Company as of and for the year ended December 26, 2020. Be & Cheery’s total assets and net revenue represented approximately 1.1% and 0.4%, respectively, of the consolidated total assets and net revenue of the Company as of and for the year ended December 26, 2020. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Pioneer Foods and Be & Cheery. Basis for Opinions The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and 107 Table of Contents performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Sales incentive accruals As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company offers sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. A number of the sales incentives are based on annual targets, resulting in the need to accrue for the expected liability. These incentives are accrued for in the “Accounts payable and other current liabilities” line on the balance sheet. These accruals are based on sales incentive agreements, expectations regarding customer and consumer participation and performance levels, and historical experience and trends. We identified the evaluation of certain of the Company’s sales incentive accruals as a critical audit matter. Subjective and complex auditor judgment is required in evaluating these sales incentive accruals as a result of the timing difference between when the product is delivered and when the incentive is settled. This specifically related to (1) forecasted customer and consumer participation 108 Table of Contents and performance level assumptions underlying the accrual, and (2) the impact of historical experience and trends. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the critical audit matter. This included controls related to the Company’s sales incentive process, including (1) the accrual methodology, (2) assumptions around forecasted customer and consumer participation, (3) performance levels, and (4) monitoring of actual sales incentives incurred compared to estimated sales incentives in respect of historical periods. To evaluate the timing and amount of certain accrued sales incentives we (1) analyzed the accrual by sales incentive type as compared to historical trends to identify specific sales incentives that may require additional testing, (2) recalculated expenses and closing accruals on a sample basis, based on volumes sold and terms of the sales incentives, (3) assessed the Company’s ability to accurately estimate its sales incentive accrual by comparing previously established accruals to actual settlements, and (4) tested a sample of settlements or claims that occurred after period end, and compared them to the recorded sales incentive accrual. Carrying value of certain reacquired and acquired franchise rights and certain juice and dairy brands As discussed in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company performs impairment testing of its indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis during the third quarter of each fiscal year and whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that there is a greater than 50% likelihood that the asset is impaired. The carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December 26, 2020 was $36.4 billion which represents 39% of total assets, and includes PepsiCo Beverages North America’s (PBNA) reacquired and acquired franchise rights which had a carrying value of $8.6 billion as of December 26, 2020. We identified the assessment of the carrying value of PBNA’s reacquired and acquired franchise rights and certain of Europe’s juice and dairy brands in Russia as a critical audit matter. Significant auditor judgment is necessary to assess the impact of competitive operating and macroeconomic factors on future levels of sales, operating profit and cash flows. The impairment analysis of these indefinite-lived intangible assets requires significant auditor judgment to evaluate the Company’s forecasted revenue and profitability levels, including the expected long-term growth rates and the selection of the discount rates to be applied to the projected cash flows. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the critical audit matter. This included controls related to the Company’s indefinite-lived assets impairment process to develop the forecasted revenue, profitability levels, and expected long-term growth rates and select the discount rates to be applied to the projected cash flows. We also evaluated the sensitivity of the Company’s conclusion to changes in assumptions, including the assessment of changes in assumptions from prior periods. To assess the Company’s ability to accurately forecast, we compared the Company’s historical forecasted results to actual results. We compared the cash flow projections used in the impairment tests with available external industry data and other internal information. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in evaluating (1) the long-term growth rates used in the impairment tests by comparing against economic data and information specific to the respective assets, including projected long-term nominal Gross Domestic Product growth in the respective local countries, and (2) the discount rates used in the impairment tests by comparing them against discount rates that were independently developed using publicly available market data, including that of comparable companies. 109 Table of Contents Unrecognized tax benefits As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s global operating model gives rise to income tax obligations in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions in which it operates. As of December 26, 2020, the Company recorded reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $1.6 billion. The Company establishes reserves if it believes that certain positions taken in its tax returns are subject to challenge and the Company likely will not succeed, even though the Company believes the tax return position is supportable under the tax law. The Company adjusts these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of new information, such as the progress of a tax examination, new tax law, relevant court rulings or tax authority settlements. We identified the evaluation of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits as a critical audit matter because the application of tax law and interpretation of a tax authority’s settlement history is complex and involves subjective judgment. Such judgments impact both the timing and amount of the reserves that are recognized, including judgments about re-measuring liabilities for positions taken in prior years’ tax returns in light of new information. The following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the critical audit matter. This included controls related to the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits process, including controls to (1) identify uncertain income tax positions, (2) evaluate the tax law and tax authority’s settlement history used to estimate the unrecognized tax benefits, and (3) monitor for new information that may give rise to changes to the existing unrecognized tax benefits, such as progress of a tax examination, new tax law or tax authority settlements. We involved tax and valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in assessing the unrecognized tax benefits by (1) evaluating the Company’s tax structure and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, and (2) assessing the Company’s interpretation of existing tax law as well as new and amended tax laws, tax positions taken, associated external counsel opinions, information from tax examinations, relevant court rulings and tax authority settlements. /s/ KPMG LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1990.

As of the end of the period covered by this report, we carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this report our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is (1) recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in Securities and Exchange Commission rules and forms, and (2) accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. (b) Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act. Under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based upon criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 26, 2020. As permitted by SEC guidance, the scope of management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 26, 2020 excluded Pioneer Foods and Be & Cheery, both acquired in 2020. Pioneer Foods’ total assets and net revenue represented approximately 2.2% and 1.4%, respectively, of the consolidated total assets and net revenue of PepsiCo, Inc. as of and for the year ended December 26, 2020. Be & Cheery’s total assets and net revenue represented approximately 1.1% and 0.4%, respectively, of the consolidated total assets and net revenue of PepsiCo, Inc. as of and for the year ended December 26, 2020.

KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and, as part of their audit, has issued their report, included herein, on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. (c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Except as discussed, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our fourth quarter of 2020 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. During our fourth quarter of 2020, we continued migrating certain of our financial processing systems to an enterprise-wide systems solution. These systems implementations are part of our ongoing global business transformation initiative, and we plan to continue implementing such systems throughout other parts of our businesses. In addition, in connection with our 2019 multi-year productivity plan, we continue 113 Table of Contents to migrate to shared business models across our operations to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes. In connection with these implementations and resulting business process changes, we continue to enhance the design and documentation of our internal control over financial reporting processes to maintain effective controls over our financial reporting. These transitions have not materially affected, and we do not expect them to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Item 9B. Other Information. Not applicable. Item 9.

These forward-looking statements are based on currently available information, operating plans and projections about future events and trends.

PART I Item 1. Business. When used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “PepsiCo” and the “Company” mean PepsiCo, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, collectively. Certain terms used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are defined in the Glossary included in Item 7. of this report. Company Overview We were incorporated in Delaware in 1919 and reincorporated in North Carolina in 1986. We are a leading global food and beverage company with a complementary portfolio of brands, including Frito-Lay, Gatorade, Pepsi-Cola, Quaker and Tropicana. Through our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a wide variety of convenient beverages, foods and snacks, serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories. Our Operations Changes to Organizational Structure During the fourth quarter of 2019, we realigned our Europe Sub-Saharan Africa (ESSA) and Asia, Middle East and North Africa (AMENA) reportable segments to be consistent with a recent strategic realignment of our organizational structure and how our Chief Executive Officer assesses the performance of, and allocates resources to, our reportable segments. As a result, our beverage, food and snack businesses in North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia that were part of our former AMENA segment and our businesses in Sub-Saharan Africa that were part of our former ESSA segment are now reported together as our Africa, Middle East and South Asia (AMESA) segment. The remaining beverage, food and snack businesses that were part of our former AMENA segment are now reported together as our Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China region (APAC) segment and our beverage, food and snack businesses in Europe are now reported as our Europe segment. These changes did not impact our Frito-Lay North America (FLNA), Quaker Foods North America (QFNA), 2 Table of Contents PepsiCo Beverages North America (PBNA), formerly named North America Beverages, or Latin America (LatAm) reportable segments or our consolidated financial results .

The distribution system used depends on customer needs, product characteristics and local trade practices. Direct-Store-Delivery We, our independent bottlers and our distributors operate DSD systems that deliver beverages, foods and snacks directly to retail stores where the products are merchandised by our employees or our independent bottlers. DSD enables us to merchandise with maximum visibility and appeal. DSD is especially well-suited to products that are restocked often and respond to in-store promotion and merchandising. Customer Warehouse Some of our products are delivered from our manufacturing plants and warehouses to customer warehouses. These less costly systems generally work best for products that are less fragile and perishable, and have lower turnover. Distributor Networks We distribute many of our products through third-party distributors. Third-party distributors are particularly effective when greater distribution reach can be achieved by including a wide range of products on the delivery vehicles. For example, our foodservice and vending business distributes beverages, foods and snacks to restaurants, businesses, schools and stadiums through third-party foodservice and vending distributors and operators. E-commerce Our products are also available and sold directly to consumers on a growing number of company-owned and third-party e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications. Ingredients and Other Supplies The principal ingredients we use in our beverage, food and snack products are apple, orange and pineapple juice and other juice concentrates, aspartame, corn, corn sweeteners, flavorings, flour, grapefruit, oranges and other fruits, oats, potatoes, raw milk, rice, seasonings, sucralose, sugar, vegetable and essential oils, and wheat. We also use water in the manufacturing of our products. Our key packaging materials include plastic resins, including polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene resins used for plastic beverage bottles and film packaging used for snack foods, aluminum, glass, closures, cardboard and paperboard cartons. In addition, we continue to integrate recyclability into our product development process and support the increased use of recycled content, including recycled PET, in our packaging. Fuel, electricity and natural gas are also important commodities for our businesses due to their use in our and our business partners’ facilities and the vehicles delivering our products. We employ specialists to secure adequate supplies of many of these items and have not experienced any significant continuous shortages that would prevent us from meeting our requirements. Many of these ingredients, raw materials and commodities are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and futures. In addition, risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. When prices increase, we may or may not pass on such increases to our customers. In addition, we continue to make investments to improve the sustainability and resources of our agricultural supply chain, including the development of our initiative to advance sustainable farming practices by our suppliers and expanding it further globally. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on how we manage our exposure to commodity prices. 5 Table of Contents Our Brands and Intellectual Property Rights We own numerous valuable trademarks which are essential to our worldwide businesses, including 1893, Agusha, Amp Energy, Aquafina, Aquafina Flavorsplash, Arto Lifewater, Aunt Jemima, Bare, Bolt24, bubly, Cap’n Crunch, Cheetos, Chester’s, Chipita, Chipsy, Chokis, Chudo, Cracker Jack, Crunchy, Diet Mountain Dew, Diet Mug, Diet Pepsi, Diet 7UP (outside the United States), Domik v Derevne, Doritos, Duyvis, Elma Chips, Emperador, Evolve, Frito-Lay, Fritos, Fruktovy Sad, G2, Gamesa, Gatorade, Grandma’s, H2oh!, Health Warrior, Imunele, Izze, J-7 Tonus, Kas, KeVita, Kurkure, Lay’s, Life, Lifewtr, Lubimy, Manzanita Sol, Marias Gamesa, Matutano, Mirinda, Miss Vickie’s, Mother’s, Mountain Dew, Mountain Dew Amp Game Fuel, Mountain Dew Code Red, Mountain Dew Ice, Mountain Dew Kickstart, Mountain Dew Zero Sugar, Mug, Munchies, Muscle Milk, Naked, Near East, Off the Eaten Path, O.N.E., Paso de los Toros, Pasta Roni, Pepsi, Pepsi Black, Pepsi Max, Pepsi Zero Sugar, Propel, Quaker, Quaker Chewy, Rice-A-Roni, Rold Gold, Rosquinhas Mabel, Ruffles, Sabritas, Sakata, Saladitas, San Carlos, Sandora, Santitas, 7UP (outside the United States), 7UP Free (outside the United States), Sierra Mist, Sierra Mist Zero Sugar, Simba, Smartfood, Smith’s, Snack a Jacks, SoBe, SodaStream, Sonric’s, Stacy’s, Sting, Stubborn Soda, SunChips, Toddy, Toddynho, Tostitos, Trop 50, Tropicana, Tropicana Pure Premium, Tropicana Twister, V Water, Vesely Molochnik, Walkers and Ya. We also hold long-term licenses to use valuable trademarks in connection with our products in certain markets, including Dole and Ocean Spray. We also distribute Rockstar Energy drinks and various Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. brands, including Dr Pepper in certain markets, Crush and Schweppes. Joint ventures in which we have an ownership interest either own or have the right to use certain trademarks, such as Lipton, Sabra and Starbucks. Trademarks remain valid so long as they are used properly for identification purposes, and we emphasize correct use of our trademarks. We have authorized, through licensing arrangements, the use of many of our trademarks in such contexts as snack food joint ventures and beverage bottling appointments. In addition, we license the use of our trademarks on merchandise that is sold at retail, which enhances brand awareness. We either own or have licenses to use a number of patents which relate to certain of our products, their packaging, the processes for their production and the design and operation of various equipment used in our businesses. Some of these patents are licensed to others. Seasonality Our businesses are affected by seasonal variations. Our beverage, food and snack sales are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related patterns, and generally lowest in the first quarter. However, taken as a whole, seasonality has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial results. Our Customers Our customers include wholesale and other distributors, foodservice customers, grocery stores, drug stores, convenience stores, discount/dollar stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, hard discounters, e-commerce retailers and authorized independent bottlers, among others. We normally grant our independent bottlers exclusive contracts to sell and manufacture certain beverage products bearing our trademarks within a specific geographic area. These arrangements provide us with the right to charge our independent bottlers for concentrate, finished goods and Aquafina royalties and specify the manufacturing process required for product quality. We also grant distribution rights to our independent bottlers for certain beverage products bearing our trademarks for specified geographic areas. We rely on and provide financial incentives to our customers to assist in the distribution and promotion of our products to the consumer. For our independent distributors and retailers, these incentives include volume-based rebates, product placement fees, promotions and displays. For our independent bottlers, these incentives are referred to as bottler funding and are negotiated annually with each bottler to support a variety of trade and consumer programs, such as consumer incentives, advertising support, new product support, and vending and cooler equipment placement. Consumer incentives include pricing discounts and promotions, and other 6 Table of Contents promotional offers. Advertising support is directed at advertising programs and supporting independent bottler media. New product support includes targeted consumer and retailer incentives and direct marketplace support, such as point-of-purchase materials, product placement fees, media and advertising. Vending and cooler equipment placement programs support the acquisition and placement of vending machines and cooler equipment. The nature and type of programs vary annually. Changes to the retail landscape, including increased consolidation of retail ownership, the rapid growth of sales through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription services and other direct-to-consumer businesses, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers, as well as the growth in hard discounters, and the current economic environment continue to increase the importance of major customers. In 2019 , sales to Walmart Inc. (Walmart) and its affiliates, including Sam’s Club (Sam’s), represented approximately 13% of our consolidated net revenue, with sales reported across all of our divisions. Our top five retail customers represented approximately 34% of our 2019 net revenue in North America, with Walmart and its affiliates (including Sam’s) representing approximately 19% . These percentages include concentrate sales to our independent bottlers, which were used in finished goods sold by them to these retailers. See “Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements” in “Our Financial Results – Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for more information on our independent bottlers. Our Competition Our beverage, food and snack products are in highly competitive categories and markets and compete against products of international beverage, food and snack companies that, like us, operate in multiple geographies, as well as regional, local and private label manufacturers and economy brands and other competitors, including smaller companies developing and selling micro brands directly to consumers through e-commerce platforms or through retailers focused on locally-sourced products. In many countries in which our products are sold, including the United States, The Coca-Cola Company is our primary beverage competitor. Other beverage, food and snack competitors include, but are not limited to, Campbell Soup Company, Conagra Brands, Inc., Kellogg Company, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., The Kraft Heinz Company, Link Snacks, Inc., Mondelēz International, Inc., Monster Beverage Corporation, Nestlé S.A. and Red Bull GmbH. Many of our food and snack products hold significant leadership positions in the food and snack industry in the United States and worldwide. In 2019 , we and The Coca-Cola Company represented approximately 22% and 20%, respectively, of the U.S. liquid refreshment beverage category by estimated retail sales in measured channels, according to Information Resources, Inc. However, The Coca-Cola Company has significant carbonated soft drink (CSD) share advantage in many markets outside the United States. Our beverage, food and snack products compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition and loyalty, taste, price, value, quality, product variety, innovation, distribution, advertising, marketing and promotional activity (including digital), packaging, convenience, service and the ability to anticipate and effectively respond to consumer preferences and trends, including increased consumer focus on health and wellness and the continued acceleration of e-commerce and other methods of distributing and purchasing products. Success in this competitive environment is dependent on effective promotion of existing products, effective introduction of new products and reformulations of existing products, increased efficiency in production techniques, effective incorporation of technology and digital tools across all areas of our business, the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns, marketing programs, product packaging and pricing, new vending and dispensing equipment and brand and trademark development and protection. We believe that the strength of our brands, innovation and marketing, coupled with the quality of our products and flexibility of our distribution network, allows us to compete effectively. 7 Table of Contents Research and Development We engage in a variety of research and development activities and invest in innovation globally with the goal of meeting changing consumer demands and preferences and accelerating sustainable growth. These activities principally involve: development of new ingredients, flavors and products; reformulation and improvement in the quality and appeal of existing products; improvement and modernization of manufacturing processes, including cost reduction; improvements in product quality, safety and integrity; development of, and improvements in, marketing and merchandising equipment, dispensing equipment, packaging technology (including investments in recycling-focused technologies), package design (including development of sustainable, bio-based packaging) and portion sizes; efforts focused on identifying opportunities to transform, grow and broaden our product portfolio, including by developing products with improved nutrition profiles that reduce added sugars, sodium or saturated fat, including through the use of natural flavors, sweetener alternatives and flavor modifiers and innovation in existing sweeteners and flavoring, further expanding our beyond the bottle portfolio, including further growing our SodaStream business, and offering more products with positive nutrition including whole grains, fruits and vegetables, dairy, protein and hydration; investments in building our capabilities to support our global e-commerce business; investments in technology and digitalization, including data analytics to enhance our consumer insights; and efforts focused on reducing our impact on the environment, including improvements in energy efficiency, water use in our operations and our agricultural practices. Our research centers are located around the world, including Brazil, China, India, Ireland, Mexico, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States, and leverage nutrition science, food science, engineering and consumer insights to meet our strategy to continue to innovate in nutritious and convenient beverages, foods and snacks. In 2019 , we continued to make investments to further digitalize our business including: continuing to strengthen our omnichannel capabilities, particularly in e-commerce; and leveraging technology and data analytics to capture and analyze consumer level data to increasingly structure personalized communications with consumers and satisfy demand at the store level. In addition, we continued to refine our beverage, food and snack portfolio to meet changing consumer demands by reducing added sugars in many of our beverages and sodium and saturated fat in many of our foods and snacks, and by developing a broader portfolio of product choices, including: continuing to expand our beverage options that contain no high-fructose corn syrup and that are made with natural flavors; expanding our beyond the bottle offerings by offering bubly in fountain dispensing; developing 100% recycled PET packaging for LIFEWTR and aluminum can packaging for Aquafina; expanding our state of the art food and beverage healthy vending initiative to increase the availability of nutritious and convenient beverages, foods and snacks; further expanding our portfolio, through a combination of brand extensions, product reformulations, new product innovations and acquisitions to offer products with more of the nutritious ingredients and hydration our consumers are looking for, such as Quaker (grains), Tropicana (juices, lemonades, fruit and vegetable drinks), Gatorade (sports nutrition for athletes), Naked Juice (cold-pressed juices and smoothies), KeVita (probiotics, tonics and fermented teas), Bare (baked apple chips and other baked fruits and vegetables), Health Warrior (nutrition bars), Evolve (plant-based protein products) and Muscle Milk (protein shakes); further expanding our whole grain products globally; and further expanding our portfolio in growing categories, such as dairy, hummus and other refrigerated dips, and baked grain snacks. In addition, we continued to make investments to reduce our impact on the environment, including: efforts to conserve raw materials and energy, such as by working to achieve reductions in greenhouse gas emissions across our global businesses, by helping to protect and conserve global water supply especially in high-water-risk locations (including replenishing watersheds that source our operations in high-water-risk locations and promoting the efficient use of water in our agricultural supply chain), and by incorporating improvements in the sustainability and resources of our agricultural supply chain into our operations; efforts to reduce waste generated by our operations and disposed of in landfills; efforts to increase energy efficiency, including the increased use of renewable energy and resources; efforts to support sustainable agriculture by expanding best practices with our growers and suppliers, including 8 Table of Contents through the use of data and technology to optimize yields and efficiency and promote responsible use of pesticides; and efforts to create a circular future for packaging, including the increased use of recycled content and alternative packaging, support for increased packaging recovery and recycling rates globally, optimization of packaging technology and design to minimize the amount of plastic in our packaging and to make our packaging increasingly recoverable or recyclable with lower environmental impact, and our continued investments in developing compostable and biodegradable packaging. Regulatory Matters The conduct of our businesses, including the production, storage, distribution, sale, display, advertising, marketing, labeling, content, quality, safety, transportation, packaging, disposal, recycling and use of our products, as well as our employment and occupational health and safety practices and protection of personal information, are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States, as well as to laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies in the more than 200 other countries and territories in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. It is our policy to abide by the laws and regulations around the world that apply to our businesses. The U.S. laws and regulations that we are subject to include: the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and various state laws governing food safety; the Food Safety Modernization Act; the Occupational Safety and Health Act; various federal, state and local environmental protection laws, as discussed below; the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act; the Federal Trade Commission Act; the Lanham Act; various federal and state laws and regulations governing competition and trade practices; various federal and state laws and regulations governing our employment practices, including those related to equal employment opportunity, such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Act and the National Labor Relations Act and those related to overtime compensation, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act; data privacy and personal data protection laws and regulations, including the California Privacy Act of 2018; customs and foreign trade laws and regulations, including laws regarding the import or export of our products or ingredients used in our products and tariffs; laws regulating the sale of certain of our products in schools; laws regulating our supply chain, including the 2010 California Transparency in Supply Chains Act and laws relating to the payment of taxes. We are also required to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act. We are also subject to various state and local statutes and regulations, including state consumer protection laws such as Proposition 65 in California, which requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a substance listed by the State of California as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects, unless the amount of such substance in the product is below a safe harbor level. We are subject to numerous similar and other laws and regulations outside the United States, including but not limited to laws and regulations governing food safety, international trade and tariffs, supply chain, including the U.K. Modern Slavery Act, occupational health and safety, competition, anti-corruption and data privacy, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. In many jurisdictions, compliance with competition laws is of special importance to us due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions, as is compliance with anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act. We rely on legal and operational compliance programs, as well as in-house and outside counsel and other experts, to guide our businesses in complying with the laws and regulations around the world that apply to our businesses. In addition, certain jurisdictions have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or commodities used in the production of our products. These taxes vary in scope and form: some apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). Similarly, some measures apply a single tax rate per ounce/liter on beverages containing over a certain level of added sugar (or other sweetener) while others apply a graduated tax rate depending upon the amount of added sugar (or other sweetener) in the beverage and some apply a flat tax 9 Table of Contents rate on beverages containing a particular substance or ingredient, regardless of the level of such substance or ingredient. In addition, certain jurisdictions have either imposed, or are considering imposing, product labeling or warning requirements or other limitations on the marketing or sale of certain of our products as a result of ingredients or substances contained in such products or the audience to whom products are marketed. These types of provisions have required that we provide a label that highlights perceived concerns about a product or warns consumers to avoid consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in our products. It is possible that similar or more restrictive requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future. In addition, certain jurisdictions have either imposed or are considering imposing regulations designed to increase recycling rates or encourage waste reduction. These regulations vary in scope and form from deposit return systems designed to incentivize the return of beverage containers, to extended producer responsibility policies and even bans on the use of some plastic beverage bottles and other single-use plastics. It is possible that similar or more restrictive requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future. We are also subject to national and local environmental laws in the United States and in foreign countries in which we do business, including laws related to water consumption and treatment, wastewater discharge and air emissions. In the United States, our facilities must comply with the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other federal and state laws regarding handling, storage, release and disposal of wastes generated onsite and sent to third-party owned and operated offsite licensed facilities and our facilities outside the United States must comply with similar laws and regulations. In addition, continuing concern over climate change may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements (in or outside of the United States) to reduce or mitigate the potential effects of greenhouse gases, or to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity concerns. Our policy is to abide by all applicable environmental laws and regulations, and we have internal programs in place with respect to our global environmental compliance. We have made, and plan to continue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. While these expenditures have not had a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations to date, changes in environmental compliance requirements, and any expenditures necessary to comply with such requirements, could adversely affect our financial performance. In addition, we and our subsidiaries are subject to environmental remediation obligations arising in the normal course of business, as well as remediation and related indemnification obligations in connection with certain historical activities and contractual obligations, including those of businesses acquired by us or our subsidiaries. While these environmental remediation and indemnification obligations cannot be predicted with certainty, such obligations have not had, and are not expected to have, a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. In addition to the discussion in this section, see also “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Employees As of December 28, 2019 , we and our consolidated subsidiaries employed approximately 267,000 people worldwide, including approximately 116,000 people within the United States. In certain countries, our employment levels are subject to seasonal variations. We or our subsidiaries are party to numerous collective bargaining agreements. We expect that we will be able to renegotiate these collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms when they expire. We believe that relations with our employees are generally good. Available Information We are required to file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at http://www.sec.gov . 10 Table of Contents Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and amendments to those documents filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (Exchange Act), are also available free of charge on our Internet site at http://www.pepsico.com as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. Investors should note that we currently announce material information to our investors and others using filings with the SEC, press releases, public conference calls, webcasts or our corporate website ( www.pepsico.com ), including news and announcements regarding our financial performance, key personnel, our brands and our business strategy. Information that we post on our corporate website could be deemed material to investors. We encourage investors, the media, our customers, consumers, business partners and others interested in us to review the information we post on these channels. We may from time to time update the list of channels we will use to communicate information that could be deemed material and will post information about any such change on www.pepsico.com . The information on our website is not, and shall not be deemed to be, a part hereof or incorporated into this or any of our other filings with the SEC. Item 1A. Risk Factors. You should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. These risks, some of which have occurred and any of which may occur in the future, can have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or the price of our publicly traded securities. The risks described below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, may occur or become material in the future and adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations or the price of our publicly traded securities. Therefore, historical operating results, financial and business performance, events and trends are often not a reliable indicator of future operating results, financial and business performance, events or trends. Future demand for our products may be adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences or any inability on our part to innovate, market or distribute our products effectively, and any significant reduction in demand could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We are a global food and beverage company operating in highly competitive categories and markets. To generate revenues and profits, we rely on continued demand for our products and therefore must understand our customers and consumers and sell products that appeal to them in the sales channel in which they prefer to shop or browse for such products. In general, changes in consumption in our product categories or consumer demographics can result in reduced demand for our products. Demand for our products depends in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively respond to shifts in consumer trends and preferences, including increased demand for products that meet the needs of consumers who are concerned with: health and wellness (including products that have less added sugars, sodium and saturated fat); convenience (including responding to changes in in-home and on-the-go consumption patterns and methods of distribution of our products to customers and consumers, including through e-commerce and hard discounters); or the location of origin or source of ingredients and products (including the environmental impact related to production and packaging of our products). Consumer preferences continuously evolve, due to a variety of factors, including: changes in consumer demographics, including the aging of the general population and the emergence of the millennial and younger generations who have differing spending, consumption and purchasing habits; consumer concerns or perceptions regarding the nutrition profile of products, including the presence of added sugar, sodium and saturated fat in certain of our products; growing demand for organic, locally or sustainably sourced ingredients, or consumer concerns or perceptions (whether or not valid) regarding the health effects of ingredients or 11 Table of Contents substances present in certain of our products, such as 4-MeI, acrylamide, artificial flavors and colors, artificial sweeteners, aspartame, caffeine, furfuryl alcohol, high-fructose corn syrup, partially hydrolyzed oils, saturated fat, sodium, sugar, trans fats or other product ingredients, substances or attributes, including genetically engineered ingredients; taxes or other restrictions, including labeling requirements, imposed on our products; consumer concerns or perceptions regarding packaging materials, including single-use and other plastic packaging, and their environmental impact; changes in package or portion size; changes in social trends that impact travel, vacation or leisure activity patterns; changes in weather patterns or seasonal consumption cycles; the continued acceleration of e-commerce and other methods of purchasing products; negative publicity (whether or not valid) resulting from regulatory actions, litigation against us or other companies in our industry or negative or inaccurate posts or comments in the media, including social media, about us, our employees, our products or advertising campaigns and marketing programs; perception of our employees, agents, customers, suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties or our respective social media posts, business practices or other information disseminated by or regarding them or us; product boycotts; or a downturn in economic conditions. These factors have in the past and could in the future reduce consumers’ willingness to purchase certain of our products and any inability on our part to anticipate or react to such changes can lead to reduced demand for our products or erode our competitive and financial position, resulting in adverse effects on our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. Demand for our products is also dependent in part on product quality, product and marketing innovation and production and distribution, including our ability to: maintain a robust pipeline of new products; improve the quality of existing products; extend our portfolio of products in growing markets and categories (through acquisitions and innovation, such as increasing non-carbonated beverage offerings and other alternatives to, or reformulations of, carbonated beverage offerings); respond to cultural differences and regional consumer preferences (whether through developing or acquiring new products that are responsive to such preferences); monitor and adjust our use of ingredients and packaging materials (including to respond to applicable regulations); develop sweetener alternatives and innovation; increase the recyclability or recoverability of our packaging; create more relevant and personalized experiences for consumers whether in a digital environment or through digital devices in an otherwise physical environment; improve the production and distribution of our products; enhance our data analytics capabilities to develop new commercial insights; respond to competitive product and pricing pressures and changes in distribution channels, including in the e-commerce channel; maintain our labeling certifications (e.g., non-GMO) from independent organizations and regulatory authorities for certain of our products; and implement effective advertising campaigns and marketing programs, including successfully adapting to a rapidly changing media environment through the use of social media and online advertising campaigns and marketing programs. Although we devote significant resources to the items mentioned above, there can be no assurance as to our continued ability to develop, launch, maintain or distribute successful new products or variants of existing products in a timely manner (including correctly anticipating or effectively reacting to changes in consumer preferences) or to develop and effectively execute advertising and marketing campaigns that appeal to customers and consumers, including through the use of digital technology. Our failure to make the right strategic investments to drive innovation or successfully launch new products or variants of existing products or effectively market or distribute our products can reduce demand for our products, result in inventory write-offs and erode our competitive and financial position and can adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Changes in laws and regulations relating to the use or disposal of plastics or other product packaging can increase our costs, reduce demand for our products or otherwise have an adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. 12 Table of Contents Certain of our food and beverage products are sold in plastic or other packaging designed to be recoverable for recycling but not all packaging is recovered, whether due to lack of infrastructure or otherwise. In addition, certain of our packaging is not currently recyclable, compostable or biodegradable. There is a growing concern with the accumulation of plastic, including microplastics, and other packaging waste in the environment, particularly in the world’s oceans and waterways. As a result, packaging waste that displays one or more of our brands has in the past and could continue to result in negative publicity (whether or not valid) or reduce consumer demand and overall consumption of our products, resulting in adverse effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In response to these concerns, the United States and many other jurisdictions have imposed or are considering imposing regulations or policies designed to increase the sustainability of packaging, encourage waste reduction and increase recycling rates or facilitate the waste management process or restrict the sale of products in certain packaging. These regulations vary in scope and form from taxes or fees designed to incentivize behavior to restrictions or bans on certain products and materials. For example, 24 countries in the European Union (EU) have established extended producer responsibility (EPR) policies, which make manufacturers such as us responsible for the costs of recycling beverage and food packaging after consumers have used them. EPR policies are also being contemplated in other jurisdictions around the world, including certain states in the United States. In addition, 10 states in the United States as well as a growing number of European countries have a bottle deposit return system in effect, which requires a deposit charged to consumers to incentivize the return of the beverage container. Further, certain jurisdictions have imposed or are considering imposing other types of regulations or policies, including packaging taxes, requirements for bottle caps to be tethered to the plastic bottle, minimum recycled content mandates, which would require packaging to include a certain percentage of post-consumer recycled material in a new package, and even bans on the use of some plastic beverage bottles and other single-use plastics. These laws and regulations, whatever their scope or form, have in the past and could continue to increase the cost of our products, reduce consumer demand and overall consumption of our products or result in negative publicity (whether or not valid), resulting in adverse effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations. While we continue to devote significant resources to increase the recyclability and sustainability of our packaging, the increased focus on reducing plastic waste has required and could continue to require us to increase capital expenditures, including requiring additional investments to minimize the amount of plastic across our packaging, including to increase the use of alternative packaging materials (e.g., glass and aluminum) in certain markets; increase the amount of recycled content in our packaging; and develop sustainable, bio-based packaging as a replacement for fossil fuel-based plastic packaging, including flexible film alternatives for our snacks packaging. Our failure to minimize our plastics use, increase the amount of recycled content in our packaging or develop sustainable packaging or consumers’ failure to accept such sustainable packaging has in the past and could continue to reduce consumer demand and overall consumption of our products and erode our competitive and financial position. Further, our reputation can be damaged for failure to achieve our sustainability goals with respect to our plastics use, including our goal to reduce 35% of virgin plastic content across our beverage portfolio by 2025, or if we or others in our industry do not act, or are perceived not to act, responsibly with respect to packaging or disposal of our products. Changes in, or failure to comply with, laws and regulations applicable to our products or our business operations can adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. The conduct of our business is subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States, as well as government entities and agencies outside the United States, including laws and regulations relating to the production, storage, distribution, sale, display, advertising, marketing, labeling, content, quality, safety, transportation, packaging, disposal, recycling and use of our products, as well as our employment and occupational health and safety practices and protection of personal information. In addition, in many jurisdictions, compliance with competition laws is of special 13 Table of Contents importance to us due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions, as is compliance with anti-corruption laws. Many of these laws and regulations have differing or conflicting legal standards across the various markets where our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold and, in certain markets, such as developing and emerging markets, may be less developed or certain. For example, products containing genetically engineered ingredients are subject to differing regulations and restrictions in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, as is the packaging, disposal and recyclability of our products. For example, the EU has mandated tethered caps for all beverage bottles by 2024 and minimum recycled content of 25% for PET bottles by 2025 and 30% for all plastic bottles by 2030 and laws mandating various minimum recycled content thresholds for PET bottles are also in place in Turkey, Bolivia, Ecuador and Peru, while the use of recycled content in food and beverage packaging is prohibited in a range of countries, for example, in Asia. In addition, these laws and regulations and related interpretations have changed and could continue to change, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly, as a result of a variety of factors, including political, economic or social events. Such changes have included and could continue to include changes in: food and drug laws; laws related to product labeling, advertising and marketing practices, including restrictions on the audience to whom products are marketed; laws and treaties related to international trade, including laws regarding the import or export of our products or ingredients used in our products and tariffs; laws and programs aimed at reducing, restricting or eliminating ingredients or substances in, or attributes of, certain of our products; laws related to pesticide used by farmers in our supply chain or residual amounts of pesticide that may be found in certain of our ingredients or products; laws related to traceability requirements for our supply chain; laws and programs aimed at discouraging the consumption or altering the package or portion size of certain of our products, including laws imposing restrictions on the use of government funds or programs to purchase certain of our products; increased regulatory scrutiny of, and increased litigation involving product claims and concerns (whether or not valid) regarding the effects on health of ingredients or substances in, or attributes of, certain of our products, including without limitation those found in energy drinks; state consumer protection laws; laws regulating the protection of personal information; cyber-security regulations; regulatory initiatives, including the imposition or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes or other measures impacting the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products; accounting rules and interpretations; employment laws; privacy laws; laws regulating the price we may charge for our products; laws regulating water rights and access to and use of water or utilities; environmental laws, including laws relating to the regulation of water treatment and discharge of wastewater and air emissions and laws relating to the disposal, recovery or recycling of our products and their packaging. Changes in regulatory requirements or changing interpretations thereof, and differing or competing regulations and standards across the markets where our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, have in the past and could continue to result in higher compliance costs, capital expenditures and higher production costs, resulting in adverse effects on our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. The imposition of new laws, regulations or governmental policy and their related interpretations, or changes in any of the foregoing, including taxes, labeling, product, production, recovery or recycling requirements, or other limitations on, or pertaining to, the sale or advertisement of certain of our products, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products, commodities used in the production of our products or use, disposal, recovery or recyclability of our products and their packaging, may further alter the way in which we do business and, therefore, may continue to increase our costs or liabilities or reduce demand for our products, resulting in adverse effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new requirements or restrictions, other jurisdictions often follow. For example, if one jurisdiction imposes a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages or foods, or imposes a specific labeling or warning requirement, other jurisdictions may impose similar or other measures that impact the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products. The foregoing has in the past and could continue to result 14 Table of Contents in decreased demand for certain of our products, adverse publicity or increased concerns about the health implications of consumption of ingredients or substances in our products (whether or not valid). In addition, studies (whether or not scientifically valid) have been and continue to be underway by third parties purporting to assess the health implications of consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in certain of our products or packaging materials, such as 4-MeI, acrylamide, caffeine, pesticides (e.g., glyphosate), furfuryl alcohol, added sugars, sodium, saturated fat and plastic. Third parties have also published documents or studies claiming (whether or not valid) that taxes can address consumer consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and foods high in sugar, sodium or saturated fat. The results of these studies and documents have contributed to or resulted in and could continue to contribute to or result in an increase in consumer concerns (whether or not valid) about the health implications of consumption of certain of our products, an increase in the number of jurisdictions that impose taxes on our products, or an increase in new labeling, product or production requirements or other restrictions on the manufacturing, sale or display of our products, resulting in reduced demand for our products, our Company being subject to lawsuits or new regulations that can adversely affect sales of our products, and other adverse effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Although we have policies and procedures in place that are designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance, our employees, suppliers, or other third parties with whom we do business can take actions, intentional or not, that violate these policies and procedures or applicable laws or regulations or can fail to maintain required documentation sufficient to evidence our compliance with applicable laws or regulations. Failure to comply with such laws or regulations can subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions, including fines, injunctions, product recalls, penalties, disgorgement of profits or activity restrictions, any of which can adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, certain regulatory authorities under whose laws we operate have enforcement powers that can subject us to actions such as product recall, seizure of products or assets or other sanctions, resulting in an adverse effect on the sales of products in our portfolio or damage to our reputation. In addition, we and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of legal and environmental remediation obligations arising in the normal course of business, as well as environmental remediation, product liability, toxic tort and related indemnification proceedings in connection with certain historical activities and contractual obligations, including those of businesses acquired by us or our subsidiaries. Due to regulatory complexities, uncertainties inherent in litigation and the risk of unidentified contaminants on current and former properties of ours and our subsidiaries, the potential exists for remediation, liability and indemnification costs to differ materially from the costs we have estimated. We cannot guarantee that our costs in relation to these matters will not exceed our estimates or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The imposition or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes aimed at our products can adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or commodities used in the production of our products. These taxes vary in scope and form: some apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). Similarly, some measures apply a single tax rate per ounce/liter on beverages containing over a certain level of added sugar (or other sweetener) while others apply a graduated tax rate depending upon the amount of added sugar (or other sweetener) in the beverage and some apply a flat tax rate on beverages containing a particular substance or ingredient, regardless of the particular substance or ingredient levels. For example, Peru revised an existing threshold tax to become a graduated tax, effective June 2019, in which the per-ounce tax rate is tied to the amount of added sugar present in the beverage: the higher the amount of added sugar, the higher the per- 15 Table of Contents ounce tax rate, while Saudi Arabia expanded an existing flat tax rate of 50% on the retail price of carbonated soft drinks to include all sweetened beverages, including non-caloric beverages, effective December 2019. These tax measures, whatever their scope or form, have in the past and could continue to increase the cost of certain of our products, reduce consumer demand and overall consumption of our products, lead to negative publicity (whether based on scientific fact or not) or leave consumers with the perception (whether or not valid) that our products do not meet their health and wellness needs, resulting in adverse effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Significant additional labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products could reduce demand for such products and can adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of certain of our products as a result of ingredients or substances contained in such products. These types of provisions have required that we provide a label that highlights perceived concerns about a product or warns consumers to avoid consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in our products. For example, in California in the United States, Proposition 65 requires a specific warning on or relating to any product that contains a substance listed by the State of California as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects or other reproductive harm, unless the level of such substance in the product is below a safe harbor level established by the State of California. In addition, a number of jurisdictions, both in and outside the United States, have imposed or are considering imposing labeling requirements, including color-coded labeling of certain food and beverage products where colors such as red, yellow and green are used to indicate various levels of a particular ingredient, such as sugar, sodium or saturated fat. The imposition or proposed imposition of additional product labeling or warning requirements has in the past and could continue to reduce overall consumption of our products, lead to negative publicity (whether based on scientific fact or not) or leave consumers with the perception (whether or not valid) that our products do not meet their health and wellness needs, resulting in adverse effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our business, financial condition or results of operations can suffer if we are unable to compete effectively. Our beverage, food and snack products are in highly competitive categories and markets and compete against products of international beverage, food and snack companies that, like us, operate in multiple geographies, as well as regional, local and private label manufacturers and economy brands and other competitors, including smaller companies developing and selling micro brands directly to consumers through e-commerce platforms or through retailers focused on locally-sourced products. In many countries in which our products are sold, including the United States, The Coca-Cola Company is our primary beverage competitor. Other beverage, food and snack competitors include, but are not limited to, Campbell Soup Company, Conagra Brands, Inc., Kellogg Company, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., The Kraft Heinz Company, Link Snacks, Inc., Mondelēz International, Inc., Monster Beverage Corporation, Nestlé S.A. and Red Bull GmbH. Our beverage, food and snack products compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition and loyalty, taste, price, value, quality, product variety, innovation, distribution, advertising, marketing and promotional activity, packaging, convenience, service and the ability to anticipate and effectively respond to consumer preferences and trends, including increased consumer focus on health and wellness and the continued acceleration of e-commerce and other methods of distributing and purchasing products. If we are unable to effectively promote our existing products or introduce new products, if our advertising or marketing campaigns are not effective, if we fail to invest in and incorporate technology and digital tools across all areas of our business (including the use of data analytics to enhance our ability to effectively market to consumers), if our competitors spend more aggressively than we do or if we are otherwise unable to effectively respond to pricing pressure or 16 Table of Contents compete effectively (including in distributing our products effectively and cost efficiently through all existing and emerging channels of trade, including through e-commerce and hard discounters), we may be unable to grow or maintain sales or category share or we may need to increase capital, marketing or other expenditures, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Failure to realize anticipated benefits from our productivity or reinvestment initiatives or operating model can have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our future success and earnings growth depend, in part, on our ability to continue to reduce costs and improve efficiencies, including implementing shared business service organizational models while reinvesting back into the business. Our productivity initiatives help support our growth initiatives and contribute to our results of operations. We continue to implement productivity initiatives that we believe will position our business for long-term sustainable growth by allowing us to achieve a lower cost structure, improve decision-making and operate more efficiently in the highly competitive beverage, food and snack categories and markets. Some of these measures have yielded and could continue to yield unintended consequences, such as business disruptions, distraction of management and employees, reduced employee morale and productivity, and unexpected additional employee attrition, including the inability to attract or retain key personnel. It is critical that we have the appropriate personnel in place to lead and execute our plans, including to effectively manage personnel adjustments and transitions resulting from these initiatives and increased competition for employees with the skills necessary to implement our plans. If we are unable to successfully implement our productivity initiatives as planned, fail to implement these initiatives as timely as we anticipate, do not achieve expected savings as a result of these initiatives or incur higher than expected or unanticipated costs in implementing these initiatives, fail to identify and implement additional productivity opportunities in the future, or fail to successfully manage business disruptions or unexpected employee consequences on our workforce, morale or productivity, we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits, resulting in adverse effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Further, in order to continue to capitalize on our cost reduction efforts and operating model, it will be necessary to make certain investments in our business, which may be limited due to capital constraints. From time to time, we have in the past and could continue to implement these investment initiatives to enable us to compete more effectively, including investments to increase manufacturing capacity, improve innovation, transform our manufacturing, commercial and corporate operations through digital technologies and artificial intelligence, and enhance brand management through our use of data analytics to develop new commercial and consumer insights. If we fail to realize all or any of the anticipated benefits of these reinvestment initiatives, our business, financial condition or results of operations can be adversely affected. Our business, financial condition or results of operations can be adversely affected as a result of political conditions in the markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. Political conditions in the markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have been and could continue to be difficult to predict, resulting in adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The results of elections, referendums or other political conditions (including government shutdowns) in these markets have in the past and could continue to impact how existing laws, regulations and government programs or policies are implemented or create uncertainty as to how such laws, regulations and government programs or policies may change, including with respect to tariffs, sanctions, climate change regulation, taxes, benefit programs, the movement of goods, services and people between countries, relationships between countries, customer or consumer perception of a particular country or its government and other matters, and has resulted in and could continue to result in exchange rate fluctuation, volatility in global stock markets and global economic uncertainty or adversely affect demand for our products. For example, the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union (commonly referred to as Brexit) is likely to lead to differing laws and regulations in the United Kingdom and European Union and further global economic, trade and regulatory uncertainty. Any changes in, or the imposition of, 17 Table of Contents new laws, regulations or governmental policy and their related interpretations due to elections, referendums or other political conditions can have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our business, financial condition or results of operations can be adversely affected if we are unable to grow our business in developing and emerging markets. Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business in developing and emerging markets, including Mexico, Russia, the Middle East, Brazil, China and India. However, there can be no assurance that our existing products, variants of our existing products or new products that we make, manufacture, distribute or sell will be accepted or be successful in any particular developing or emerging market, due to local or global competition, product price, cultural differences, consumer preferences as to distribution or otherwise. The following factors can reduce demand for our products or otherwise impede the growth of our business in developing and emerging markets: unstable economic, political or social conditions; acts of war, terrorist acts, and civil unrest; increased competition; volatility in the economic growth of certain of these markets and the related impact on developed countries who export to these markets; volatile oil prices and the impact on the local economy in certain of these markets; our inability to acquire businesses, form strategic business alliances or to make necessary infrastructure investments; our inability to complete divestitures or refranchisings; imposition of new or increased labeling, product or production requirements, or other restrictions; our inability to hire or retain a highly skilled workforce; imposition of new or increased tariffs and other impositions on imported goods or sanctions against, or other regulations restricting contact with, certain countries in these markets, or imposition of new or increased sanctions against U.S. multinational corporations or tariffs on the products of such corporations operating in these markets; actions, such as removing our products from shelves, taken by retailers in response to U.S. trade sanctions, tariffs or other governmental action or policy; foreign ownership restrictions; nationalization of our assets or the assets of our suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties; imposition of taxes on our products or the ingredients or substances used in our products; government-mandated closure, or threatened closure, of our operations or the operations of our suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners, customers or other third parties; restrictions on the import or export of our products or ingredients or substances used in our products; regulations relating to the repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions to the United States; highly inflationary economies and potential highly inflationary economies, devaluation or fluctuation, such as the devaluation of the Russian ruble, Turkish lira, Brazilian real, Argentine peso and the Mexican peso, or demonetization of currency; regulations on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, currency controls or other currency exchange restrictions, which result in significant cash balances in foreign countries, from time to time, or can significantly affect our ability to effectively manage our operations in certain of these markets and can result in the deconsolidation of such businesses, such as occurred with respect to our Venezuelan businesses which were deconsolidated at the end of the third quarter of 2015; the lack of well-established or reliable legal systems; increased costs of doing business due to compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act; and adverse consequences, such as the assessment of fines or penalties, for any failure to comply with these laws and regulations. If we are unable to expand our businesses in developing and emerging markets, effectively operate, or manage the risks associated with operating, in these markets, or achieve the return on capital we expect from our investments in these markets, our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations can be adversely affected. Uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 18 Table of Contents Many of the countries in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold have experienced and could continue to experience uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions, such as recessions or economic slowdowns. Our business or financial results have in the past and could continue to be adversely impacted by uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions in the United States and globally, including: adverse changes in interest rates, tax laws or tax rates; volatile commodity markets, including speculative influences; highly inflationary economies, devaluation, fluctuation or demonetization; contraction in the availability of credit in the marketplace due to legislation or economic conditions; the effects of government initiatives, including demonetization, austerity or stimulus measures to manage economic conditions and any changes to or cessation of such initiatives; the effects of any default by or deterioration in the creditworthiness of the countries in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold or of countries that may then impact countries in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold; reduced demand for our products resulting from volatility in general global economic conditions or a shift in consumer preferences for economic reasons or otherwise to regional, local or private label products or other lower-cost products, or to less profitable sales channels; or a decrease in the fair value of pension or post-retirement assets that could increase future employee benefit costs and/or funding requirements of our pension or post-retirement plans. In addition, we cannot predict how current or future economic conditions will affect our customers, consumers, suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties and any negative impact on any of the foregoing may also have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, some of the major financial institutions with which we execute transactions, including U.S. and non-U.S. commercial banks, insurance companies, investment banks and other financial institutions, may be exposed to a ratings downgrade, bankruptcy, liquidity events, default or similar risks as a result of unfavorable economic conditions, changing regulatory requirements or other factors beyond our control. A ratings downgrade, bankruptcy, receivership, default or similar event involving a major financial institution, or changes in the regulatory environment, can limit the ability or willingness of financial institutions to enter into financial transactions with us, including to provide banking or related cash management services, or to extend credit on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all; can leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or exposed to certain currencies or price risk associated with forecasted purchases of raw materials, including through our use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and futures; or can result in a decline in the market value of our investments in debt securities, resulting in an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Similar risks exist with respect to our customers, suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors and joint venture partners and can result in their inability to obtain credit to purchase our products or to finance the manufacture and distribution of our products resulting in canceled orders and/or product delays, which can also have an adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. Our business and reputation can suffer if we are unable to protect our information systems against, or effectively respond to, cyberattacks or other cyber incidents or if our information systems, or those of our customers, suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties, are otherwise disrupted. We depend on information systems and technology, some of which are provided by third parties, including public websites and cloud-based services, for many activities important to our business, including: to interface with our customers and consumers; to engage in marketing activities; to enable and improve the effectiveness of our operations; to order and manage materials from suppliers; to manage inventory; to manage and operate our facilities; to conduct research and development, including through the use of data analytics; to maintain accurate financial records; to achieve operational efficiencies; to comply with regulatory, financial reporting, legal and tax requirements; to collect and store sensitive data and confidential information; to communicate electronically among our global operations and with our employees and the employees of our customers, 19 Table of Contents suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners and other third parties; and to communicate with our investors. Cyberattacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently, are constantly evolving in nature, are becoming more sophisticated and are being carried out by groups and individuals (including criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored actors, criminal and terrorist organizations, individuals or groups participating in organized crime and insiders) with a wide range of expertise and motives (including monetization of corporate, payment or other internal or personal data, theft of computing resources, notoriety, financial fraud, operational disruption, theft of trade secrets and intellectual property for competitive advantage and leverage for political, social, economic and environmental reasons). Such cyberattacks and cyber incidents can take many forms including cyber extortion, denial of service, social engineering, such as impersonation and identity takeover attempts to fraudulently induce employees or others to disclose information or unwittingly provide access to systems or data, introduction of viruses or malware, such as ransomware, exploiting vulnerabilities in hardware, software or other infrastructure, hacking, website defacement or theft of passwords and other credentials, unauthorized use of computing resources for digital currency mining and business email compromises. As with other global companies, we are regularly subject to cyberattacks, including many of the types of attacks described above. Although we incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyberattacks or other cyber incidents, no cyberattack or other cyber incident has, to our knowledge, had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations to date. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and maintain our information technology infrastructure, including monitoring networks and systems, upgrading our security policies and the skills and training of our employees, and requiring our third-party service providers, customers, suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties to do the same, if we or they fail to timely identify or appropriately respond to cyberattacks or other cyber incidents, or if our or their information systems are damaged, compromised, destroyed or shut down (whether as a result of natural disasters, fires, power outages, acts of terrorism or other catastrophic events, network outages, software, equipment or telecommunications failures, technology development defects, user errors, lapses in our controls or the malicious or negligent actions of employees (including misuse of information they are entitled to access), or from deliberate cyberattacks such as malicious or disruptive software, phishing, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering, hackers or otherwise), our business can be disrupted and, among other things, be subject to: transaction errors or financial loss; processing inefficiencies; the loss of, or failure to attract, new customers and consumers; lost revenues or other costs resulting from the disruption or shutdown of computer systems or other information technology systems at our offices, plants, warehouses, distribution centers or other facilities, or the loss of a competitive advantage due to the unauthorized use, acquisition or disclosure of, or access to, confidential information; the incurrence of costs to restore data and to safeguard against future extortion attempts; the loss of, or damage to, intellectual property or trade secrets, including the loss or unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data or other assets; alteration, corruption or loss of accounting, financial or other data on which we rely for financial reporting and other purposes, which can cause errors or delays in our financial reporting; damage to our reputation or brands; damage to employee, customer and consumer relations; litigation; regulatory enforcement actions or fines; unauthorized disclosure of confidential personal information of our employees, customers or consumers; the loss of information and/or business operations disruption resulting from the failure of security patches to be developed and installed on a timely basis; violation of data privacy, security or other laws and regulations; and remediation costs. Further, our information systems and those of our third-party providers, and the information stored therein can be compromised, including through cyberattacks or other external or internal methods, resulting in unauthorized parties accessing or extracting sensitive data or confidential information. In the ordinary course of business, we receive, process, transmit and store information relating to identifiable individuals, primarily employees and former employees. Privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently from country to country or, within the United States, from state to state, and can create inconsistent or 20 Table of Contents conflicting requirements. Our efforts to comply with privacy and data protection laws, including with respect to data from residents of the European Union who are covered by the General Data Protection Regulation, which went into effect in May 2018, and residents of the State of California covered by the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, impose significant costs or challenges that are likely to increase over time. Failure to comply with existing or future data privacy laws and regulations can result in litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations. We continue to devote significant resources to network security, backup and disaster recovery, enhancing our internal controls, and other security measures, including training, to protect our systems and data. In addition, our risk management program also includes periodic review and discussion by our Board of Directors of analyses of emerging cybersecurity threats and our plans and strategies to address them. However, these security measures and processes cannot provide absolute security or guarantee that we will be successful in preventing or responding to every such breach or disruption. In addition, due to the constantly evolving nature of these security threats, the form and impact of any future incident cannot be predicted. Similar risks exist with respect to the cloud-based service providers and other third-party vendors that we rely upon for aspects of our information technology support services and administrative functions, including payroll processing, health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions, and systems managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties and their vendors. The need to coordinate with various third-party vendors may complicate our efforts to resolve any issues that arise. As a result, we are subject to the risk that the activities associated with our third-party vendors may adversely affect our business even if the attack or breach does not directly impact our systems or information. Moreover, our increased use of mobile and cloud technologies has heightened these and other operational risks, as certain aspects of the security of such technologies are complex, unpredictable or beyond our control. While we currently maintain insurance coverage that, subject to its terms and conditions, is intended to address costs associated with certain aspects of cyber incidents, network failures and data privacy-related concerns, this insurance coverage may not, depending on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding an incident, cover all losses or all types of claims that arise from an incident, or the damage to our reputation or brands that may result from an incident. Our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected by increased costs, disruption of supply or shortages of raw materials, energy and other supplies. We and our business partners use various raw materials, energy and other supplies in our business. The principal ingredients we use in our beverage, food and snack products are apple, orange and pineapple juice and other juice concentrates, aspartame, corn, corn sweeteners, flavorings, flour, grapefruit, oats, oranges and other fruits, potatoes, raw milk, rice, seasonings, sucralose, sugar, vegetable and essential oils, and wheat. Our key packaging materials include plastic resins, including PET and polypropylene resins used for plastic beverage bottles and film packaging used for snack foods, aluminum used for cans, glass bottles, closures, cardboard and paperboard cartons. In addition, we continue to integrate recyclability into our product development process and support the increased use of recycled content, including recycled PET, in our packaging. Fuel, electricity and natural gas are also important commodities for our businesses due to their use in our and our business partners’ facilities and the vehicles delivering our products. Some of these raw materials and supplies are sourced from countries experiencing civil unrest, political instability or unfavorable economic conditions, and some are available from a limited number of suppliers or a sole supplier or are in short supply when seasonal demand is at its peak. We cannot assure that we will be able to maintain favorable arrangements and relationships with these suppliers or that our contingency plans, including development of ingredients, materials or supplies to replace ingredients, materials or supplies sourced from such suppliers, will be effective in preventing disruptions that may arise from shortages or discontinuation of any ingredient that is sourced from such suppliers. In addition, increasing focus on climate 21 Table of Contents change, deforestation, the use of plastics and energy, animal welfare and human rights concerns and other risks associated with the global food system is leading to increased activism focusing on consumer goods companies, governmental intervention and consumer response, and can adversely affect our or our suppliers’ reputation and business and our ability to procure the materials we need to operate our business. The raw materials and energy, including fuel, that we use for the manufacturing, production and distribution of our products are largely commodities that are subject to price volatility and fluctuations in availability caused by many factors, including changes in global supply and demand, weather conditions (including any potential effects of climate change), fire, natural disasters (such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake, wildfire or flooding), disease or pests (including the impact of greening disease on the citrus industry), agricultural uncertainty, health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks, such as the recent coronavirus, governmental incentives and controls (including import/export restrictions, such as new or increased tariffs, sanctions, quotas or trade barriers), limited or sole sources of supply, political uncertainties, acts of terrorism, governmental instability or currency exchange rates. For example, concerns regarding trade relations between the United States and China escalated during fiscal 2019, with the United States imposing tariffs on the importation of certain Chinese goods and retaliatory Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods. Higher duties on existing tariffs or additional tariffs imposed by the United States on a broader range of imports, or further retaliatory trade measures taken by China or other countries in response, could result in an increase in supply chain costs that we are not able to offset or otherwise adversely impact our results of operations. Shortage of some of these raw materials and other supplies, sustained interruption in their supply or an increase in their costs can adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Many of our ingredients, raw materials and commodities are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and futures. If commodity price changes result in unexpected or significant increases in raw materials and energy costs, we may be unwilling or unable to increase our product prices or unable to effectively hedge against commodity price increases to offset these increased costs without suffering reduced volume, revenue, margins and operating results. In addition, certain of the derivatives used to hedge price risk do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and, therefore, can result in increased volatility in our net earnings in any given period due to changes in the spot prices of the underlying commodities. Water scarcity can have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We and our suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, joint venture partners and other third parties use water in the manufacturing of our products. Water is a limited resource in many parts of the world. The lack of available water of acceptable quality, increasing focus by governmental and non-governmental organizations, investors, customers and consumers on water scarcity and increasing pressure to conserve and replenish water in areas of scarcity and stress may lead to: supply chain disruption; adverse effects on our operations or the operations of our suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributor, joint venture partners or other third parties; higher compliance costs; capital expenditures (including additional investments in the development of technologies to enhance water efficiency and reduce water consumption); higher production costs, including less favorable pricing for water; the cessation of operations at, or relocation of, our facilities or the facilities of our suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties; failure to achieve our sustainability goals relating to water use; perception (whether or not valid) of our failure to act responsibly with respect to water use or to effectively respond to new, or changes in, legal or regulatory requirements concerning water scarcity; or damage to our reputation, any of which can adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Business disruptions can have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 22 Table of Contents Our ability, and that of our suppliers and other third parties, including our bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners and customers, to make, manufacture, transport, distribute and sell products in our portfolio is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our or their operations has occurred in the past and could continue to occur due to any of the following factors which can impair the ability to make, manufacture, transport, distribute or sell products in our portfolio: adverse weather conditions (including any potential effects of climate change) or natural disasters, such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake, wildfire or flooding; government action; economic or political uncertainties or instability in countries in which such products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, which may also affect our ability to protect the security of our assets and employees; fire; terrorism; outbreak or escalation of armed hostilities; food safety warnings or recalls, whether related to products in our portfolio or otherwise; health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks, such as the recent coronavirus; supply and commodity shortages; unplanned delays or unexpected problems associated with repairs or enhancements of facilities in which such products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold; loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites; cyber incidents, including the disruption or shutdown of computer systems or other information technology systems at our offices, plants, warehouses, distribution centers or other facilities or those of our suppliers and other third parties who make, manufacture, transport, distribute and sell products in our portfolio; industrial accidents or other occupational health and safety issues; telecommunications failures; power, fuel or water shortages; strikes, labor disputes or lack of availability of qualified personnel, such as truck drivers; or other reasons beyond our control or the control of our suppliers and other third parties. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, has in the past resulted and could continue to result in adverse effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations, as well as require additional resources to restore operations. Product contamination or tampering or issues or concerns with respect to product quality, safety and integrity can adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. Product contamination or tampering, the failure to maintain high standards for product quality, safety and integrity, including with respect to raw materials and ingredients obtained from suppliers, or allegations (whether or not valid) of product quality issues, mislabeling, misbranding, spoilage, allergens, adulteration or contamination with respect to products in our portfolio may reduce demand for such products, and cause production and delivery disruptions or increase costs, which can adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the products in our portfolio are mislabeled or become unfit for consumption or cause injury, illness or death, or if appropriate resources are not devoted to product quality and safety (particularly as we expand our portfolio into new categories) or to comply with changing food safety requirements, we can decide to, or be required to, recall products in our portfolio and/or we may be subject to liability or government action, which can result in payment of damages or fines, cause certain products in our portfolio to be unavailable for a period of time, result in destruction of product inventory, or result in adverse publicity (whether or not valid), which can reduce consumer demand and brand equity. Moreover, even if allegations of product contamination or tampering or suggestions that our products were not fit for consumption are meritless, the negative publicity surrounding assertions against us or products in our portfolio or processes can adversely affect our reputation or brands. Our business can also be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in product quality, safety and integrity generally, even if such loss of confidence is unrelated to products in our portfolio. Any of the foregoing can adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, if we do not have adequate insurance, if we do not have enforceable indemnification from suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties or if indemnification is not available, the liability relating to such product claims or disruption as a result of recall efforts can materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Any damage to our reputation or brand image can adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. 23 Table of Contents We are a leading global beverage, food and snack company with brands that are respected household names throughout the world. Maintaining a good reputation globally is critical to selling our branded products. Our reputation or brand image has in the past and could continue to be adversely impacted by any of the following, or by adverse publicity (whether or not valid) relating thereto: the failure to maintain high ethical, social and environmental practices for all of our operations and activities, including with respect to human rights, child labor laws and workplace conditions and safety, or failure to require our suppliers or other third parties to do so; the failure to achieve our goals of reducing added sugars, sodium and saturated fat in certain of our products and of growing our portfolio of product choices; the failure to achieve our other sustainability goals, including with respect to plastic packaging, or to be perceived as appropriately addressing matters of social responsibility; the failure to protect our intellectual property, including in the event our brands are used without our authorization; health concerns (whether or not valid) about our products or particular ingredients or substances in, or attributes of, our products, including concerns regarding whether certain of our products contribute to obesity; the imposition or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes, labeling requirements or other limitations on, or pertaining to, the sale, display or advertising of our products; any failure to comply, or perception of a failure to comply, with our policies and goals, including those regarding advertising to children and reducing calorie consumption from sugar-sweetened beverages; our research and development efforts; the recall (voluntary or otherwise) of any products in our portfolio; our environmental impact, including use of agricultural materials, plastics or other packaging, water, energy use and waste management; any failure to achieve our goals with respect to reducing our impact on the environment, including the recyclability or recoverability of our packaging, or perception of a failure to act responsibly with respect to water use and the environment; any failure to achieve our goals with respect to human rights throughout our value chain; the practices of our employees, agents, customers, suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties (including others in our industry) with respect to any of the foregoing, actual or perceived; consumer perception of our industry; consumer perception of our advertising campaigns, sponsorship arrangements or marketing programs; consumer perception of our use of social media; consumer perception of statements made by us, our employees and executives, agents, customers, suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties (including others in our industry); or our responses or the responses of others in our industry to any of the foregoing. In addition, we operate globally, which requires us to comply with numerous local regulations, including, without limitation, anti-corruption laws, competition laws and tax laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. In the event that we or our employees or agents engage in or are believed to have engaged in improper activities, we have in the past and could continue to be subject to regulatory proceedings, including enforcement actions, litigation, loss of sales or other consequences, resulting in damage to our reputation in the United States or abroad. Failure to comply with local laws and regulations, to maintain an effective system of internal control or to provide accurate and timely financial information can also hurt our reputation. Further, the popularity of social media and other consumer-oriented technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination. As a result, negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us, our products, policies, practices, advertising campaigns and marketing programs or sponsorship arrangements; our use of social media or of posts or other information disseminated by us or our employees, agents, customers, suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties; consumer perception of any of the foregoing, or failure by us to respond effectively to any of the foregoing, has in the past and could continue to also generate adverse publicity (whether or not valid) that can damage our reputation. Damage to our reputation or brand image or loss of consumer confidence in our products or employees for any of these or other reasons has in the past and could continue to result in decreased demand for our products, 24 Table of Contents resulting in adverse effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations, as well as requiring additional resources to rebuild our reputation. Failure to successfully complete or integrate acquisitions and joint ventures into our existing operations, or to complete or effectively manage divestitures or refranchisings, can adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and evaluate potential acquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures, refranchisings and other strategic transactions. Issues associated with these activities have in the past and could continue to include, among other things: our ability to realize the full extent of the expected returns, benefits, cost savings or synergies as a result of a transaction, within the anticipated time frame, or at all; receipt of necessary consents, clearances and approvals in connection with a transaction; and diversion of management’s attention from day-to-day operations. With respect to acquisitions, the following factors also have in the past and could continue to pose additional risk risks: our ability to successfully combine our businesses with the business of the acquired company, including integrating the acquired company’s manufacturing, distribution, sales, accounting, financial reporting and administrative support activities and information technology systems with our company; our ability to successfully operate in new categories or territories; motivating, recruiting and retaining executives and key employees (both of the acquired company and our company); conforming standards, controls (including internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, environmental compliance, health and safety compliance and compliance with other laws and regulations), procedures and policies, business cultures and compensation structures between us and the acquired company; consolidating and streamlining corporate and administrative infrastructures and avoiding increased operating expenses; consolidating sales and marketing operations; retaining existing customers and attracting new customers; retaining existing distributors; identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming operations and assets; coordinating geographically dispersed organizations; managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating our operations following completion of an acquisition; and other unanticipated problems or liabilities, such as contingent liabilities and litigation. With respect to joint ventures, we share ownership and management responsibility with one or more parties who may or may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities, resources or values as we do. Joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. Business decisions or other actions or omissions of our joint venture partners have in the past and could continue to adversely affect the value of our investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against us or otherwise damage our reputation and brands and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, acquisitions and joint ventures outside of the United States increase our exposure to risks associated with operations outside of the United States, including fluctuations in exchange rates and compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and laws and regulations outside the United States. With respect to divestitures and refranchisings, we have in the past and could continue to be unable to complete or effectively manage such transactions on terms commercially favorable to us or at all, resulting in failure to achieve the anticipated benefits or cost savings from the divestiture or refranchising. Further, as divestitures and refranchisings reduce our direct control over certain aspects of our business, any failure to maintain good relations with divested or refranchised businesses in our supply or sales chain can adversely impact our sales or business performance. Acquisitions or joint ventures that are not successfully completed, integrated into our existing operations or managed effectively, or divestitures or refranchisings that are not successfully completed or managed 25 Table of Contents effectively or do not result in the benefits or cost savings we expect, have in the past and could continue to result in adverse effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations. A change in our estimates and underlying assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses can result in an impairment charge that materially affects our results of operations. We conduct impairment tests on our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, as well as other investments and other long-lived assets annually, during our third quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable and have recorded impairments in the past. Any changes in our estimates or underlying assumptions regarding the future performance of our reporting units or in determining the fair value of any such reporting unit, including goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, as well as other investments and other long-lived assets, can adversely affect our results of operations. Factors considered to determine if an impairment exist include, but are not limited to: significant negative economic or industry trends or competitive operating conditions; significant macroeconomic conditions that can result in a future increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value; and significant changes in the nature and timing of decisions regarding assets or markets that do not perform consistent with our expectations, including factors we use to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. While no material impairment charges have been recorded in the periods presented in this Form 10-K, we may in the future record impairment charges that have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the periods recognized. See Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or disagreements with tax authorities can adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Increases in income tax rates or other changes in income tax laws in any particular jurisdiction can reduce our after-tax income from such jurisdiction and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our operations outside the United States generate a significant portion of our income. In addition, existing tax laws in the United States and many of the other countries in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, including countries in which we have significant operations, have been and could in the future be subject to significant change. For example, in December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJ Act) was signed into law in the United States. While our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act is deemed to be complete, these amounts are based on prevailing regulations and currently available information, and additional guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) may continue to impact our recorded amounts in future periods. In addition, o n May 19, 2019, a public referendum held in Switzerland passed the Federal Act on Tax Reform and AHV Financing (TRAF), effective January 1, 2020. Certain provisions of the TRAF were enacted in fiscal year 2019, resulting in adjustments to our deferred taxes. The future impact of the TRAF cannot currently be estimated and we continue to monitor and assess the impact of TRAF on our business and financial results. For further information regarding the impact and potential impact of the TCJ Act and the TRAF, see “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Our Critical Accounting Policies” in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements. Additional changes in the U.S. tax regime or in how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings, including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, can adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. For example, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has recommended changes to numerous long-standing international tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project. These changes have been or are being adopted by many of the countries in which we do business. In connection with the OECD’s BEPS project, the OECD has undertaken a new project focused on “Addressing the Tax Challenges of the Digitalization of the Economy.” This project may impact all multinational businesses by reallocating where some profits are taxed and implementing a global model for minimum taxation. The increasingly complex 26 Table of Contents global tax environment has in the past and could continue to increase tax uncertainty, resulting in higher compliance costs and adverse effects on our provision for income taxes, results of operations and/or cash flow. We are also subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by the IRS and other taxing authorities with respect to income and non-income based taxes both within and outside the United States. In connection with the OECD’s BEPS project, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in various countries. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in jurisdictions in which we operate, or the adoption of new or reformed tax legislation or regulation, may make resolving tax disputes more difficult and the final resolution of tax audits and any related litigation can differ from our historical provisions and accruals, resulting in an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If we are unable to recruit, hire or retain key employees or a highly skilled and diverse workforce, it can have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our continued growth requires us to recruit, hire, retain and develop our leadership bench and a highly skilled and diverse workforce. We compete to recruit and hire new employees and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies. Our employees are highly sought after by our competitors and other companies and our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to retain, develop and motivate highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Any unplanned turnover or unsuccessful implementation of our succession plans to backfill current leadership positions, including the Chief Executive Officer, or failure to hire and retain a highly skilled and diverse workforce, including with key capabilities such as e-commerce and digital marketing and data analytic skills, can deplete our institutional knowledge base, erode our competitive advantage or result in increased costs due to increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs. Any of the foregoing can adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. The loss of, or a significant reduction in sales to, any key customer can adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our customers include wholesale and other distributors, foodservice customers, grocery stores, drug stores, convenience stores, discount/dollar stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, hard discounters, e-commerce retailers and authorized independent bottlers, among others. We must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers, including Wal-Mart, to compete effectively. Any inability to resolve a significant dispute with any of our key customers, a change in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of any of our key customers, even if unrelated to us, a significant reduction in sales to any key customer, or the loss of any of our key customers can adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Disruption in the retail landscape, including rapid growth in the e-commerce channel and hard discounters, can adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our industry has been affected by changes to the retail landscape, including the rapid growth in sales through e-commerce websites, mobile commerce applications and subscription services as well as the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers. We continue to make significant investments in attracting talent to and building our global e-commerce and digital capabilities. Although we are engaged in e-commerce with respect to many of our products, if we are unable to maintain and develop successful relationships with existing and new e-commerce retailers or otherwise adapt to the growing e-commerce landscape, while simultaneously maintaining relationships with our key customers operating in traditional retail channels, we may be disadvantaged in certain channels and with certain customers and consumers, which can adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the growth in e-commerce and hard discounters may result in consumer price deflation, which may affect our relationships with key retail 27 Table of Contents customers. Further, the ability of consumers to compare prices on a real-time basis using digital technology puts additional pressure on us to maintain competitive prices. If these e-commerce and hard discounter retailers were to take significant additional market share away from traditional retailers and/or we fail to adapt to the rapidly changing retail and e-commerce landscapes, including finding ways to create more powerful digital tools and capabilities for our retail customers to enable them to grow their businesses, our ability to maintain and grow our profitability, share of sales or volume and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, the retail landscape continues to be impacted by the increased consolidation of retail ownership and purchasing power, particularly in North America, Europe and Latin America, resulting in large retailers or buying groups with increased purchasing power, which may impact our ability to compete in these areas. Such retailers or buying groups demand improved efficiency, lower pricing and increased promotional programs. Further, should larger retailers increase utilization of their own distribution networks, other distribution channels such as e-commerce, or private label brands, the competitive advantages we derive from our go-to-market systems and brand equity may be eroded. In addition, such consolidation can continue to adversely impact our smaller customers’ ability to compete effectively, resulting in an inability on their part to pay for our products or reduced or canceled orders of our products. Further, the growth of hard discounters that are focused on limiting the number of items they sell and selling predominantly private label brands may continue to reduce our ability to sell our products through such retailers. Failure to appropriately respond to any of the foregoing, including failure to offer effective sales incentives and marketing programs to our customers, can reduce our ability to secure adequate shelf space and product availability at our retailers, adversely affect our ability to maintain or grow our share of sales or volume, and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our borrowing costs and access to capital and credit markets would be adversely affected by a downgrade or potential downgrade of our credit ratings. Rating agencies routinely evaluate us, and their ratings of our long-term and short-term debt are based on a number of factors, including our cash generating capability, levels of indebtedness, policies with respect to shareholder distributions and our financial strength generally, as well as factors beyond our control, such as the then-current state of the economy and our industry generally. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, whether as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, can increase our future borrowing costs, impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all, and result in a reduction in our liquidity. We expect to maintain Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global credit markets at favorable interest rates. However, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings can impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. Our borrowing costs and access to the commercial paper market can also be adversely affected if a credit rating agency announces that our ratings are under review for a potential downgrade. An increase in our borrowing costs, limitations on our ability to access the global capital and credit markets or a reduction in our liquidity can adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. If we are not able to successfully implement shared services or utilize information technology systems and networks effectively, our ability to conduct our business may be negatively impacted. We have entered into agreements with third-party service providers to utilize information technology support services and administrative functions in certain areas of our business, including payroll processing, health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions. We may enter into new or additional agreements for shared services in other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies as we continue to migrate to shared business service organizational models across our business 28 Table of Contents operations. In addition, we increasingly utilize cloud-based services and systems and networks managed by third-party vendors to process, transmit and store information and to conduct certain of our business activities and transactions with employees, customers, consumers and other third parties. Failure by these third-party service providers or vendors to perform effectively, or our failure to adequately monitor their performance (including compliance with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements), has in the past and could continue to result in our inability to achieve the expected cost savings, additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers, damage to our reputation or our being subject to litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations. Depending on the function involved, such errors can also lead to business disruption, processing inefficiencies, the loss of or damage to intellectual property or sensitive data through security breaches or otherwise, incorrect or adverse effects on financial reporting, litigation or remediation costs, damage to our reputation or have a negative impact on employee morale. In addition, the management of multiple third-party service providers increases operational complexity and decreases our control. We continue on our multi-year business transformation initiative to migrate certain of our systems, including our financial processing systems, to enterprise-wide systems solutions. These systems implementations are part of our ongoing global business transformation initiative, and we plan to continue implementing such systems throughout other parts of our businesses. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper information technology infrastructure, or if we fail to achieve the expected benefits from this initiative, it may impact our ability to process transactions accurately and efficiently, and remain in step with the changing needs of our business, which can result in the loss of customers or consumers and revenue. In addition, the failure to either deliver the applications on time, or anticipate the necessary readiness and training needs, can lead to business disruption and loss of customers or consumers and revenue. In connection with these implementations and resulting business process changes, we continue to enhance the design and documentation of business processes and controls, including our internal control over financial reporting processes, to maintain effective controls over our financial reporting. To date, this transition has not materially affected, and we do not expect it to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Fluctuations in exchange rates impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We hold assets, incur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the United States, where the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar, are translated into U.S. dollars. Our operations outside of the United States, particularly in Mexico, Russia, Canada, the United Kingdom, China and Brazil , generate a significant portion of our net revenue. In addition, we purchase many of the ingredients, raw materials and commodities used in our business in numerous markets and in numerous currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates, including as a result of currency controls or other currency exchange restrictions have had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Climate change or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change may negatively affect our business and operations or damage our reputation. There is concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as sugar cane, corn, wheat, rice, oats, oranges and other fruits and potatoes. Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake, wildfire or flooding, may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain and unfavorably impact the demand for, or our consumers’ ability to purchase, our products. 29 Table of Contents Concern over climate change may result in new or increased regional, federal and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases. In the event that such regulation is more stringent than current regulatory obligations or the measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor and improve our energy efficiency, we may experience disruptions in, or significant increases in our costs of, operation and delivery and be required to make additional investments in facilities and equipment or relocate our facilities. In particular, increasing regulation of fuel emissions can substantially increase the cost of energy, including fuel, required to operate our facilities or transport and distribute our products, thereby substantially increasing the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products. As a result, the effects of climate change can negatively affect our business and operations I n addition, any failure to achieve our goals with respect to reducing our impact on the environment or perception (whether or not valid) of our failure to act responsibly with respect to the environment or to effectively respond to new, or changes in, legal or regulatory requirements concerning climate change can lead to adverse publicity, resulting in an adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. There is also increased focus, including by governmental and non-governmental organizations, investors, customers and consumers on these and other environmental sustainability matters, including deforestation, land use, climate impact and recyclability or recoverability of packaging, including plastic. Our reputation can be damaged if we or others in our industry do not act, or are perceived not to act, responsibly with respect to our impact on the environment. A portion of our workforce is represented by unions. Failure to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements, or strikes or work stoppages, can cause our business to suffer. Many of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and other employees may seek to be covered by collective bargaining agreements. Strikes or work stoppages or other business interruptions can occur if we are unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms or enter into new agreements on satisfactory terms or if we are unable to otherwise manage changes in, or that affect, our workforce, which can impair manufacturing and distribution of our products or lead to a loss of sales, resulting in an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The terms and conditions of existing, renegotiated or new collective bargaining agreements can also increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully implement future operational changes to enhance our efficiency or to adapt to changing business needs or strategy. If we are not able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or if we are found to infringe the intellectual property rights of others, the value of our products or brands, or our competitive position, can be reduced, resulting in an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We possess intellectual property rights that are important to our business. These intellectual property rights include ingredient formulas, trademarks, copyrights, patents, business processes and other trade secrets that are important to our business and relate to a variety of our products, their packaging, the processes for their production and the design and operation of various equipment used in our businesses. We protect our intellectual property rights globally through a combination of trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret laws, third-party assignment and nondisclosure agreements and monitoring of third-party misuses of our intellectual property, although the laws of various jurisdictions have differing levels of protection of intellectual property. If we fail to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks, copyrights, patents, business processes and trade secrets, including our ingredient formulas, or if there is a change in law that limits or removes the current legal protections of our intellectual property, the value of our products and brands, or our competitive position, can be reduced, resulting in an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, if, in the course of developing new products or improving the quality of existing products, we are found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others, directly or indirectly, 30 Table of Contents such finding can have an adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations and may limit our ability to introduce new products or improve the quality of existing products. Potential liabilities and costs from litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations can have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations, including but not limited to matters related to our advertising, marketing or commercial practices, product labels, claims and ingredients including sugar, sodium and saturated fat, our intellectual property rights, alleged infringement or misappropriation by us of intellectual property rights of others, environmental, privacy, employment, tax and insurance matters and matters relating to our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. We evaluate such matters to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses and establish reserves as appropriate. These matters are inherently uncertain and there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves in these matters, or that our assessment of the materiality of these matters and the likely outcome or potential losses and established reserves will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such matters. In the event that management’s assessment of actual or potential claims and proceedings proves inaccurate or litigation, claims, proceedings, inquiries or investigations that are material arise in the future, there may be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Responding to litigation, claims, proceedings, inquiries, and investigations, even those that are ultimately non-meritorious, requires us to incur significant expense and devote significant resources, and may generate adverse publicity that damages our reputation or brand image, resulting in an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Many factors can adversely affect the price of our publicly traded securities. Many factors can adversely affect the price of our common stock and publicly traded debt. Such factors, some of which are beyond our control, have in the past and could continue to include, but are not limited to: unfavorable economic conditions; changes in financial or tax reporting and changes in accounting principles or practices that materially affect our reported financial condition and results; investor perceptions of our business, strategies and performance or those of our competitors; actions by shareholders or others seeking to influence our business strategies; speculation by the media or investment community regarding our business, strategies and performance or those of our competitors; developments relating to pending litigation, claims, inquiries or investigations; changes in laws and regulations applicable to our products or business operations; trading activity in our securities or trading activity in derivative instruments with respect to our securities; changes in our credit ratings; the impact of our share repurchase programs or dividend policy; and the outcome of referenda and elections. In addition, corporate actions, such as those we have or have not taken in the past or may or may not take in the future as part of our continuous review of our corporate structure and our strategy, including as a result of business, legal, regulatory and tax considerations, have not and may not in the future have the impact we intend, resulting in adversely effects on the price of our securities. The above factors, as well as the other risks included in this “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” can adversely affect the price of our securities. Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. We have received no written comments regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff of the SEC that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of our 2019 year and that remain unresolved. 31 Table of Contents Item 2. Properties. Our principal executive office located in Purchase, New York and our facilities located in Plano, Texas, all of which we own, are our most significant corporate properties. In connection with making, marketing, distributing and selling our products, each division utilizes manufacturing, processing, bottling and production plants, warehouses, distribution centers, storage facilities, offices, including division headquarters, research and development facilities and other facilities, all of which are either owned or leased. Significant properties by division are as follows: • FLNA’s research and development facility in Plano, Texas, which is owned. • QFNA’s food plant in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, which is owned. • PBNA’s research and development facility in Valhalla, New York, and a Tropicana plant in Bradenton, Florida, both of which are owned. • LatAm’s three snack plants in Mexico (one in Celaya and two in Vallejo), all of which are owned. • Europe’s snack plant in Kashira, Russia, its dairy plant in Moscow, Russia, and its fruit juice plant in Zeebrugge, Belgium, all of which are owned. • AMESA’s snack plant in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, which is leased. • APAC’s snack plant in Wuhan, China, which is owned. • Our primary concentrate plants in Cork, Ireland and in Singapore, all of which are either owned or leased. Our concentrate plants in Cork, Ireland are shared by our PBNA, Europe and AMESA segments and our concentrate plant in Singapore is shared by our PBNA and APAC segments. • A shared service center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, which is primarily shared by our FLNA, QFNA and PBNA segments, which is leased. Most of our plants are owned or leased on a long-term basis. In addition to company-owned or leased properties described above, we also utilize a highly distributed network of plants, warehouses and distribution centers that are owned or leased by our contract manufacturers, co-packers, strategic alliances or joint ventures in which we have an equity interest. We believe that our properties generally are in good operating condition and, taken as a whole, are suitable, adequate and of sufficient capacity for our current operations. Item 3. Legal Proceedings. We and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations. While the results of such litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the final outcome of the foregoing will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. See also “Item 1. Business – Regulatory Matters” and “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Item 4. Mine Safety Disclosures. Not applicable. __________________________________________________ 32 Table of Contents Information About Our Executive Officers The following is a list of names, ages and backgrounds of our current executive officers: Name Age Title Marie T.

OUR BUSINESS Executive Overview PepsiCo is a leading global food and beverage company with a complementary portfolio of brands, including Frito-Lay, Gatorade, Pepsi-Cola, Quaker and Tropicana. Through our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a wide variety of convenient beverages, foods and snacks, serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories Everything we do is driven by an approach we call Winning with Purpose. Winning with Purpose is our guide for achieving accelerated, sustainable growth that includes our mission, to Create More Smiles with Every Sip and Every Bite; our vision, to Be the Global Leader in Convenient Foods and Beverages by Winning with Purpose; and The PepsiCo Way, seven behaviors that define our shared culture. Winning with Purpose is designed to help us meet the needs of our shareholders, customers, consumers, partners and communities, while caring for our planet and inspiring our associates. This strategy is also designed to address key challenges facing our Company, including: shifting consumer preferences and behaviors; a highly competitive operating environment; a rapidly changing retail landscape, including the growth in e-commerce; continued macroeconomic and political volatility; and an evolving regulatory landscape. To adapt to these challenges, we intend to continue to focus on becoming Faster, Stronger, and Better: • Faster by winning in the marketplace, being more consumer-centric and accelerating investment for topline growth. This includes broadening our portfolios to win locally in convenient foods and beverages, fortifying our North American businesses, and accelerating our international expansion, with disciplined focus on markets where we see a strong likelihood of prevailing over our competition. • Stronger by continuing to transform our capabilities, cost, and culture by leveraging scale and technology in global markets across our operations and winning locally. This includes continuing to focus on driving savings through holistic cost management to reinvest to succeed in the marketplace, developing and scaling core capabilities through technology, and building differentiated talent and culture. • Better by continuing to focus our sustainability agenda on helping to build a more sustainable food system and investing in six priority areas: next generation agriculture, water stewardship, plastic packaging, products, climate change, and people. We believe these priorities will position our Company for long-term sustainable growth. See also “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further information about risks and uncertainties that the Company faces. Our Operations See “Item 1. Business” for information on our divisions and a description of our distribution network, ingredients and other supplies, brands and intellectual property rights, seasonality, customers and competition. In addition, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for financial information about our divisions and geographic areas. 42 Table of Contents Other Relationships Certain members of our Board of Directors also serve on the boards of certain vendors and customers. These Board members do not participate in our vendor selection and negotiations nor in our customer negotiations. Our transactions with these vendors and customers are in the normal course of business and are consistent with terms negotiated with other vendors and customers. In addition, certain of our employees serve on the boards of Pepsi Bottling Ventures LLC and other affiliated companies of PepsiCo and do not receive incremental compensation for such services. Our Business Risks We are subject to risks in the normal course of business. During the periods presented in this report, certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold operated in a challenging environment, experiencing unstable economic, political and social conditions, civil unrest, natural disasters, debt and credit issues, and currency controls or fluctuations. We continue to monitor the economic, operating and political environment in these markets closely and to identify actions to potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results. In addition, certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes or regulations on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products or their packaging, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or their packaging, commodities used in the production of our products or their packaging or the recyclability or recoverability of our packaging. These taxes and regulations vary in scope and form. For example, some taxes apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). In addition, some regulations apply to all products using certain types of packaging (e.g., plastic), while others are designed to increase the sustainability of packaging, encourage waste reduction and increased recycling rates or facilitate waste management process or restrict the sale of products in certain packaging. We sell a wide variety of beverages, foods and snacks in more than 200 countries and territories and the profile of the products we sell, the amount of revenue attributable to such products and the type of packaging used varies by jurisdiction. Because of this, we cannot predict the scope or form potential taxes, regulations or other limitations on our products or their packaging may take, and therefore cannot predict the impact of such taxes, regulations or limitations on our financial results. In addition, taxes, regulations and limitations may impact us and our competitors differently. We continue to monitor existing and proposed taxes and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such taxes, regulations or limitations, including advocating alternative measures with respect to the imposition, form and scope of any such taxes, regulations or limitations. In addition, our industry continues to be affected by disruption of the retail landscape, including the rapid growth in sales through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription services, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers and the international expansion of hard discounters. We continue to monitor changes in the retail landscape and to identify actions we may take to build our global e-commerce and digital capabilities, distribute our products effectively through all existing and emerging channels of trade and potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. Our provisional measurement period ended in the fourth quarter of 2018 and while our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act was deemed to be complete, additional guidance issued by the IRS impacted, and may continue to impact, our recorded amounts after December 29, 2018. For further information, see “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources,” “Our Critical Accounting Policies” and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements. 43 Table of Contents On May 19, 2019, a public referendum held in Switzerland passed the TRAF , effective January 1, 2020. The enactment of certain provisions of the TRAF in 2019 resulted in adjustments to our deferred taxes. During 2019 , we recorded net tax expense of $24 million related to the impact of the TRAF. Enactment of the TRAF provisions subsequent to December 28, 2019 is expected to result in adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in future periods. The future impact of the TRAF cannot currently be reasonably estimated; we will continue to monitor and assess the impact the TRAF may have on our business and financial results. See “Our Critical Accounting Policies” and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. See also “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Executive Overview” above and “Market Risks” below for more information about these risks and the actions we have taken to address key challenges. Risk Management Framework The achievement of our strategic and operating objectives involves taking risks and that those risks may evolve over time. To identify, assess, prioritize, address, manage, monitor and communicate these risks across the Company’s operations, we leverage an integrated risk management framework. This framework includes the following: • PepsiCo’s Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for PepsiCo’s integrated risk management framework. One of the Board’s primary responsibilities is overseeing and interacting with senior management with respect to key aspects of the Company’s business, including risk assessment and risk mitigation of the Company’s top risks. The Board receives updates on key risks throughout the year, including risks related to cybersecurity. In addition, the Board has tasked designated Committees of the Board with oversight of certain categories of risk management, and the Committees report to the Board regularly on these matters. ◦ The Audit Committee of the Board reviews and assesses the guidelines and policies governing PepsiCo’s risk management and oversight processes, and assists the Board’s oversight of financial, compliance and employee safety risks facing PepsiCo; ◦ The Compensation Committee of the Board reviews PepsiCo’s employee compensation policies and practices to assess whether such policies and practices could lead to unnecessary risk-taking behavior; ◦ The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee assists the Board in its oversight of the Company’s governance structure and other corporate governance matters, including succession planning; and ◦ The Public Policy and Sustainability Committee of the Board assists the Board in its oversight of PepsiCo’s policies, programs and related risks that concern key sustainability and public policy matters. • The PepsiCo Risk Committee (PRC), which is comprised of a cross-functional, geographically diverse, senior management group, including PepsiCo’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, meets regularly to identify, assess, prioritize and address top strategic, financial, operating, compliance, safety, reputational and other risks. The PRC is also responsible for reporting progress on our risk mitigation efforts to the Board; • Division and key country risk committees, comprised of cross-functional senior management teams, meet regularly to identify, assess, prioritize and address division and country-specific business risks; • PepsiCo’s Risk Management Office, which manages the overall risk management process, provides ongoing guidance, tools and analytical support to the PRC and the division and key country risk committees, identifies and assesses potential risks and facilitates ongoing communication between 44 Table of Contents the parties, as well as with PepsiCo’s Board of Directors, the Audit Committee of the Board and other Committees of the Board; • PepsiCo’s Corporate Audit Department evaluates the ongoing effectiveness of our key internal controls through periodic audit and review procedures; and • PepsiCo’s Compliance & Ethics and Law Departments lead and coordinate our compliance policies and practices. Market Risks We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in: • commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy; • foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and • interest rates. In the normal course of business, we manage commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of strategies, including productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs and hedging. Ongoing productivity initiatives involve the identification and effective implementation of meaningful cost-saving opportunities or efficiencies, including the use of derivatives. Our global purchasing programs include fixed-price contracts and purchase orders and pricing agreements. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion of our market risks, and see “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information on our non-cancelable purchasing commitments. The fair value of our derivatives fluctuates based on market rates and prices. The sensitivity of our derivatives to these market fluctuations is discussed below. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these derivatives and our hedging policies. See “Our Critical Accounting Policies” for a discussion of the exposure of our pension and retiree medical plan assets and liabilities to risks related to market fluctuations. Inflationary, deflationary and recessionary conditions impacting these market risks also impact the demand for and pricing of our products. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion. Commodity Prices Our commodity derivatives had a total notional value of $1.1 billion as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 . At the end of 2019 , the potential change in fair value of commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10% decrease in the underlying commodity price, would have increased our net unrealized losses in 2019 by $106 million . Foreign Exchange Our operations outside of the United States generated 42% of our consolidated net revenue in 2019 , with Mexico, Russia, Canada, the United Kingdom, China and Brazil , collectively, comprising approximately 22% of our consolidated net revenue in 2019 . As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risks in the international markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. Additionally, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency purchases, foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business, as well as the proposed acquisition of Pioneer Foods. During 2019 , unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net revenue growth by 2 percentage points, reflecting declines in the euro, Turkish lira, Brazilian real, Russian ruble and Argentine peso. Currency declines against the U.S. dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our future financial results. 45 Table of Contents In addition, volatile economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, including in Argentina, Brazil, China, Mexico, the Middle East, Russia and Turkey, and currency controls or fluctuations in certain of these international markets, continue to, and the threat or imposition of new or increased tariffs or sanctions or other impositions in or related to these international markets may, result in challenging operating environments. We also continue to monitor the economic and political developments related to the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union, including how the United Kingdom will interact with other European Union countries following its departure, as well as the economic, operating and political environment in Russia and the potential impact for the Europe segment and our other businesses. Our foreign currency derivatives had a total notional value of $1.9 billion as of December 28, 2019 and $2.0 billion as of December 29, 2018 . At the end of 2019 , we estimate that an unfavorable 10% change in the underlying exchange rates would have increased our net unrealized losses in 2019 by $135 million . The total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was $2.5 billion as of December 28, 2019 and $0.9 billion as of December 29, 2018 . Interest Rates Our interest rate derivatives had a total notional value of $5.0 billion as of December 28, 2019 and $10.5 billion as of December 29, 2018 . Assuming year-end 2019 investment levels and variable rate debt, a 1-percentage-point increase in interest rates would have decreased our net interest expense in 2019 by $25 million due to higher cash and cash equivalents as compared with our variable rate debt. 46 Table of Contents OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS Results of Operations — Consolidated Review Volume Beverage volume reflects sales of concentrate and beverage products bearing company-owned or licensed trademarks to authorized bottlers, independent distributors and retailers. Concentrate beverage volume is sold to franchised-owned bottlers and independent distributors. Finished goods beverage volume is sold to retailers and independent distributors and includes direct shipments to retailers. Beverage volume is measured in bottler case sales (BCS), which converts all beverage volume to an 8-ounce-case metric. We believe that BCS is a valuable measure as it quantifies the sell-through of our beverage products at the customer level. In our franchised-owned business, beverage revenue is based on concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE), representing physical concentrate volume shipments to such customers. As a result, for our franchise-owned businesses, BCS and CSE are not typically equal during any given period due to seasonality, timing of product launches, product mix, bottler inventory practices and other factors. Sales of products from our unconsolidated joint ventures are reflected in our reported volume. PBNA, LatAm, Europe, AMESA and APAC, either independently or in conjunction with third parties, make, market, distribute and sell ready-to-drink tea products through a joint venture with Unilever (under the Lipton brand name), and PBNA, either independently or in conjunction with third parties, makes, markets, distributes and sells ready-to-drink coffee products through a joint venture with Starbucks. In addition, APAC licenses the Tropicana brand for use in China on co-branded juice products in connection with a strategic alliance with Tingyi. Food and snack volume is reported on a system-wide basis, which includes our own sales and the sales by our noncontrolled affiliates of snacks bearing company-owned or licensed trademarks. In addition, FLNA makes, markets, distributes and sells Sabra refrigerated dips and spreads through a joint venture with Strauss Group. Servings Since our divisions each use different measures of physical unit volume (i.e., kilos, gallons, pounds and case sales), a common servings metric is necessary to reflect our consolidated physical unit volume. Our divisions’ physical volume measures are converted into servings based on U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidelines for single-serving sizes of our products. In 2019 , total servings increased 4% compared to 2018 , primarily reflecting our acquisition of SodaStream. In 2018, total servings increased 1% compared to 2017. Consolidated Net Revenue and Operating Profit Change 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 Net revenue $ 67,161 $ 64,661 $ 63,525 4 % 2 % Operating profit $ 10,291 $ 10,110 $ 10,276 2 % (2 )% Operating profit margin 15.3 % 15.6 % 16.2 % (0.3 ) (0.5 ) See “Results of Operations – Division Review” for a tabular presentation and discussion of key drivers of net revenue. 47 Table of Contents 2019 Operating profit grew 2% and operating profit margin declined 0.3 percentage points. Operating profit growth was driven by productivity savings of more than $1 billion and net revenue growth, partially offset by certain operating cost increases, a 5-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs and higher advertising and marketing expenses. The operating profit margin decline primarily reflects higher advertising and marketing expenses. Favorable mark-to-market net impact on commodity derivatives included in corporate unallocated expenses (see “Items Affecting Comparability”) contributed 3 percentage points to operating profit growth. Gains on the refranchising of a portion of our beverage business in Thailand and our entire beverage bottling operations and snack distribution operations in CHS in the prior year reduced operating profit growth by 2 percentage points. 2018 Operating profit decreased 2% and operating profit margin declined 0.5 percentage points. The operating profit performance was driven by certain operating cost increases and a 6-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, partially offset by productivity savings of more than $1 billion and net revenue growth. The impact of refranchising a portion of our beverage business in Jordan in 2017 and a 2017 gain associated with the sale of our minority stake in Britvic negatively impacted operating profit performance by 2.5 percentage points. These impacts were offset by a 2-percentage-point positive impact of refranchising a portion of our beverage business in Thailand and our entire beverage bottling operations and snack distribution operations in CHS in 2018. Items affecting comparability (see “Items Affecting Comparability”) negatively impacted operating profit performance by 3 percentage points and decreased operating profit margin by 0.5 percentage points, primarily due to higher mark-to-market net impact on commodity derivatives included in corporate unallocated expenses. Results of Operations — Division Review During the fourth quarter of 2019, we realigned certain of our reportable segments to be consistent with a recent strategic realignment of our organizational structure and how our Chief Executive Officer assesses the performance of, and allocates resources to, our reportable segments. Our historical segment reporting presented in this report has been retrospectively revised to reflect the new organizational structure. See “Our Operations” in “Item 1. Business” for further information. See “Non-GAAP Measures” and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a discussion of items to consider when evaluating our results and related information regarding measures not in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). In the discussions of net revenue and operating profit below, “effective net pricing” reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries, and “net pricing” reflects the year-over-year combined impact of list price changes, weight changes per package, discounts and allowances. Additionally, “acquisitions and divestitures” reflect all mergers and acquisitions activity, including the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees . 48 Table of Contents Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth Organic revenue growth is a non-GAAP financial measure.

QFNA 2019 Net revenue grew 1% and volume was flat. The net revenue growth primarily reflects favorable mix. The volume performance was driven by double-digit growth in trademark Gamesa and mid-single-digit growth in Aunt Jemima mixes and syrups, offset by a mid-single-digit decline in oatmeal and a low-single-digit decline in ready-to-eat cereals. Operating profit decreased 15%, reflecting certain operating cost increases, a 5-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, and higher advertising and marketing expenses. These impacts were partially offset by productivity savings. 2018 Net revenue declined 1.5% and volume declined 0.5%. The net revenue performance reflects unfavorable net pricing and mix and the volume decline. The volume decline was driven by a double-digit decline in trademark Gamesa and a mid-single-digit decline in ready-to-eat cereals, partially offset by mid-single-digit growth in oatmeal. Operating profit decreased slightly, reflecting certain operating cost increases, the net revenue performance and a 3-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs. These impacts were partially offset by productivity savings, lower advertising and marketing expenses and a 1-percentage-point positive contribution from insurance settlement recoveries related to the 2017 earthquake in Mexico. PBNA 2019 Net revenue grew 3%, driven by effective net pricing, partially offset by a decline in volume. Acquisitions contributed 1 percentage point to the net revenue growth. Volume decreased 1%, driven by a 3% decline in CSD volume, partially offset by a 2% increase in non-carbonated beverage (NCB) volume. The NCB volume increase primarily reflected a mid-single-digit increase in our overall water portfolio, partially offset by a low-single-digit decrease in our juice and juice drinks portfolio. Operating profit decreased 4%, reflecting certain operating cost increases, higher advertising and marketing expenses, an 8-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs and the volume decline. These impacts were partially offset by the effective net pricing and productivity savings. Year-over-year gains on asset sales negatively contributed 1 percentage point to operating profit performance. A gain associated with an insurance recovery positively contributed 1 percentage point to current-year operating profit performance and was offset by less-favorable insurance adjustments compared to the prior year, which negatively impacted the current-year operating profit performance by 1 percentage point. Additionally, a prior-year bonus extended to certain U.S. employees in connection with the TCJ Act positively contributed 2 percentage points to operating profit performance. 52 Table of Contents 2018 Net revenue grew 1%, driven by effective net pricing, partially offset by a decline in volume. Volume decreased 1%, driven by a 3% decline in CSD volume, partially offset by a 2% increase in non-carbonated beverage volume. The non-carbonated beverage volume increase primarily reflected a high-single-digit increase in our overall water portfolio. Additionally, a low-single-digit increase in Gatorade sports drinks was offset by a low-single-digit decline in our juice and juice drinks portfolio. Operating profit decreased 16%, reflecting certain operating cost increases, including increased transportation costs, a 7-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs and higher advertising and marketing expenses. These impacts were partially offset by productivity savings and the net revenue growth. Higher gains on asset sales positively contributed 1.5 percentage points to operating profit performance. A bonus extended to certain U.S. employees related to the TCJ Act negatively impacted operating profit performance by 1.5 percentage points and was partially offset by 2017 costs related to hurricanes which positively contributed 1 percentage point to operating profit performance. LatAm 2019 Net revenue increased 3%, primarily reflecting effective net pricing, partially offset by a 4-percentage-point impact of unfavorable foreign exchange. Snacks volume experienced a slight decline, reflecting a high-single-digit decline in Brazil, partially offset by low-single-digit growth in Mexico.

Items affecting comparability (see “Items Affecting Comparability”) negatively impacted 56 Table of Contents both net income attributable to PepsiCo performance and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share performance by 38 percentage points. 2018 Other pension and retiree medical benefits income increased $65 million, reflecting the impact of the $1.4 billion discretionary pension contribution to the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan A (Plan A) in the United States, as well as the recognition of net asset gains, partially offset by higher amortization of net losses. Net interest expense increased $312 million reflecting a charge of $253 million in connection with our cash tender and exchange offers, primarily representing the tender price paid over the carrying value of the tendered notes. This increase also reflects higher interest rates on debt balances, as well as losses on the market value of investments used to economically hedge a portion of our deferred compensation liability. These impacts were partially offset by higher interest income due to higher interest rates on cash balances. The reported tax rate decreased 85.6 percentage points, reflecting both other net tax benefits related to the reorganization of our international operations, which reduced the reported tax rate by 45 percentage points, and the 2017 provisional net tax expense related to the TCJ Act, which reduced the 2018 reported tax rate by 25 percentage points. Additionally, the favorable conclusion of certain international tax audits and the favorable resolution with the IRS of all open matters related to the audits of taxable years 2012 and 2013, collectively, reduced the reported tax rate by 7 percentage points. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Net income attributable to PepsiCo increased 158% and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share increased 160%. Items affecting comparability (see “Items Affecting Comparability”) positively contributed 150 percentage points to net income attributable to PepsiCo growth and 152 percentage points to net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share growth. Non-GAAP Measures Certain financial measures contained in this Form 10-K adjust for the impact of specified items and are not in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results, and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures in this Form 10-K allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends. We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring plans; amounts associated with mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes; pension and retiree medical related items; charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as significant tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; asset impairments (non-cash); and remeasurements of net monetary assets. See below and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a description of adjustments to our U.S. GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K. Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. 57 Table of Contents In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. The following non-GAAP financial measures contained in this Form 10-K are discussed below. Cost of sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, other pension and retiree medical benefits expense/income, interest expense, provision for/benefit from income taxes, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests and net income attributable to PepsiCo, each adjusted for items affecting comparability, operating profit, adjusted for items affecting comparability, and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, adjusted for items affecting comparability, and the corresponding constant currency growth rates These measures exclude the net impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on centrally managed commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, restructuring and impairment charges related to our 2019 and 2014 Productivity Plans, inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges primarily associated with our acquisition of SodaStream, pension-related settlement charges, net tax related to the TCJ Act, other net tax benefits and charges related to cash tender and exchange offers (see “Items Affecting Comparability” for a detailed description of each of these items). We also evaluate performance on operating profit, adjusted for items affecting comparability, and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, adjusted for items affecting comparability, on a constant currency basis, which measure our financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current-year U.S. dollar results by the current-year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. We believe these measures provide useful information in evaluating the results of our business because they exclude items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance. Organic revenue growth We define organic revenue growth as net revenue growth adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange translation, as well as the impact from acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes. Starting in 2018, our reported results reflected the accounting policy election taken in conjunction with the adoption of the revenue recognition guidance to exclude from net revenue and cost of sales all sales, use, value-added and certain excise taxes assessed by governmental authorities on revenue-producing transactions not already excluded. Our 2018 organic revenue growth excluded the impact of approximately $75 million of these taxes previously recognized in net revenue. We believe organic revenue growth provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year. See “Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth” in “Results of Operations – Division Review” for further information. Free cash flow We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital spending, plus sales of property, plant and equipment . Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities. Free cash flow is used by us primarily for financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure. 58 Table of Contents See “Free Cash Flow” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information. Return on invested capital (ROIC) and net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability We define ROIC as net income attributable to PepsiCo plus interest expense after-tax divided by the sum of quarterly average debt obligations and quarterly average common shareholders’ equity. Although ROIC is a common financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating ROIC. Accordingly, the method used by management to calculate ROIC may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their ROIC. We believe this metric serves as a measure of how well we use our capital to generate returns. In addition, we use net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability, to compare our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis because it removes from our operating results the impact of items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance and reflects how management evaluates our operating results and trends. We define net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability, as ROIC, adjusted for quarterly average cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, after-tax interest income and items affecting comparability. We believe the calculation of ROIC and net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability, provides useful information to investors and is an additional relevant comparison of our performance to consider when evaluating our capital allocation efficiency. See “Return on Invested Capital” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information. Items Affecting Comparability Our reported financial results in this Form 10-K are impacted by the following items in each of the following years: 2019 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits (expense)/income Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 30,132 $ 37,029 $ 26,738 $ 10,291 $ (44 ) $ 1,959 $ 39 $ 7,314 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact 57 (57 ) 55 (112 ) — (25 ) — (87 ) Restructuring and impairment charges (115 ) 115 (253 ) 368 2 67 5 298 Inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges (34 ) 34 (21 ) 55 — 8 — 47 Pension-related settlement charges — — — — 273 62 — 211 Net tax related to the TCJ Act — — — — — 8 — (8 ) Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 30,040 $ 37,121 $ 26,519 $ 10,602 $ 231 $ 2,079 $ 44 $ 7,775 59 Table of Contents 2018 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Interest expense (Benefit from)/provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 29,381 $ 35,280 $ 25,170 $ 10,110 $ 298 $ 1,525 $ (3,370 ) $ 44 $ 12,515 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact (83 ) 83 (80 ) 163 — — 38 — 125 Restructuring and impairment charges (3 ) 3 (269 ) 272 36 — 56 1 251 Merger and integration charges — — (75 ) 75 — — — — 75 Net tax related to the TCJ Act — — — — — — 28 — (28 ) Other net tax benefits — — — — — — 5,064 — (5,064 ) Charges related to cash tender and exchange offers — — — — — (253 ) 62 — 191 Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 29,295 $ 35,366 $ 24,746 $ 10,620 $ 334 $ 1,272 $ 1,878 $ 45 $ 8,065 2017 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 28,796 $ 34,729 $ 24,453 $ 10,276 $ 233 $ 4,694 $ 4,857 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact 8 (8 ) 7 (15 ) — (7 ) (8 ) Restructuring and impairment charges — — (229 ) 229 66 71 224 Provisional net tax related to the TCJ Act — — — — — (2,451 ) 2,451 Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 28,804 $ 34,721 $ 24,231 $ 10,490 $ 299 $ 2,307 $ 7,524 (a) Provision for income taxes is the expected tax charge/benefit on the underlying item based on the tax laws and income tax rates applicable to the underlying item in its corresponding tax jurisdiction. Mark-to-Market Net Impact We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include energy, agricultural products and metals . Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in corporate unallocated expenses. Restructuring and Impairment Charges 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan The 2019 Productivity Plan, publicly announced on February 15, 2019, will leverage new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and 60 Table of Contents information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. In connection with this plan, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $2.5 billion , of which we have incurred $508 million plan to date through December 28, 2019 and cash expenditures of approximately $1.6 billion , of which we have incurred approximately $261 million plan to date through December 28, 2019 . We expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $450 million and cash expenditures of approximately $400 million in our 2020 financial results, with the balance to be reflected in our 2021 through 2023 financial results. These charges will be funded primarily through cash from operations. We expect to incur the majority of the remaining pre-tax charges and cash expenditures in our 2020 and 2021 results. 2014 Multi-Year Productivity Plan The 2014 Productivity Plan was completed in 2019. The total plan pre-tax charges and cash expenditures approximated the previously disclosed plan estimates of $1.3 billion and $960 million , respectively. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further information related to our 2019 and 2014 Productivity Plans. We regularly evaluate productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plans and other initiatives discussed above and in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. Inventory Fair Value Adjustments and Merger and Integration Charges In 2019 , we recorded inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges of $55 million ( $47 million after-tax or $0.03 per share), including $46 million in our Europe segment, $7 million in our AMESA segment and $2 million in corporate unallocated expenses. These charges are primarily related to fair value adjustments to the acquired inventory included in SodaStream’s balance sheet at the acquisition date, as well as merger and integration charges, including employee-related costs. In 2018 , we recorded merger and integration charges of $75 million ($0.05 per share), including $57 million in our Europe segment and $18 million in corporate unallocated expenses, related to our acquisition of SodaStream. These charges include closing costs, advisory fees and employee-related costs. See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Pension-Related Settlement Charges In 2019 , we recorded pension settlement charges of $273 million ($211 million after-tax or $0.15 per share), reflecting settlement charges of $220 million ( $170 million after-tax or $0.12 per share) related to the purchase of a group annuity contract and settlement charges of $53 million ( $41 million after-tax or $0.03 per share) related to one-time lump sum payments to certain former employees who had vested benefits. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Net Tax Related to the TCJ Act During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. Among its many provisions, the TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings and reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% , effective January 1, 2018. In 2017, we recorded a provisional net tax expense of $2.5 billion ( $1.70 per share) associated with the enactment of the TCJ Act. We recognized net tax benefits of $8 million ( $0.01 per share) and $28 million ( $0.02 per share) in 2019 and 2018 , respectively, related to the TCJ Act. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. 61 Table of Contents Other Net Tax Benefits In 2018, we reorganized our international operations, including the intercompany transfer of certain intangible assets. As a result, we recognized other net tax benefits of $4.3 billion ($3.05 per share). Also in 2018, we recognized non-cash tax benefits associated with both the conclusion of certain international tax audits and our agreement with the IRS resolving all open matters related to the audits of taxable years 2012 and 2013. The conclusion of certain international tax audits and the resolution with the IRS, collectively, resulted in non-cash tax benefits totaling $717 million ($0.50 per share). See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Charges Related to Cash Tender and Exchange Offers In 2018, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $253 million ($191 million after-tax or $0.13 per share) to interest expense in connection with our cash tender and exchange offers, primarily representing the tender price paid over the carrying value of the tendered notes. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. 62 Table of Contents Our Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our cash generating capability and financial condition, together with our revolving credit facilities, bridge loan facilities, working capital lines and other available methods of debt financing, such as commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs. Our primary sources of cash available to fund cash outflows, such as our anticipated share repurchases, dividend payments, debt repayments, the proposed acquisition of Pioneer Foods and the transition tax liability under the TCJ Act, include cash from operations, proceeds obtained from issuances of commercial paper, bridge loan facilities and long-term debt and cash and cash equivalents. However, there can be no assurance that volatility in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our revolving credit facilities and bridge loan facilities. See also “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Our Business Risks” for further discussion. As of December 28, 2019 , cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in our consolidated subsidiaries subject to currency controls or currency exchange restrictions were not material. The TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings, including $18.9 billion held in our consolidated subsidiaries outside the United States as of December 30, 2017. As of December 28, 2019 , our mandatory transition tax liability was $3.3 billion , which must be paid through 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act; we currently expect to pay approximately $0.1 billion of this liability in 2020 . See “Credit Facilities and Long-Term Contractual Commitments.” Any additional guidance issued by the IRS may impact our recorded amounts for this transition tax liability. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the TCJ Act. Furthermore, our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality. Working capital needs are impacted by weekly sales, which are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns, and generally lowest in the first quarter. On a continuing basis, we consider various transactions to increase shareholder value and enhance our business results, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, dividends, share repurchases, productivity and other efficiency initiatives, and other structural changes. These transactions may result in future cash proceeds or payments. The table below summarizes our cash activity: 2019 2018 2017 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 9,649 $ 9,415 $ 10,030 Net cash (used for)/provided by investing activities $ (6,437 ) $ 4,564 $ (4,403 ) Net cash used for financing activities $ (8,489 ) $ (13,769 ) $ (4,186 ) Operating Activities During 2019 , net cash provided by operating activities was $9.6 billion , compared to $9.4 billion in the prior year. The operating cash flow performance primarily reflects lower pre-tax pension and retiree medical plan contributions in the current year, partially offset by higher net cash tax payments in the current year. During 2018, net cash provided by operating activities was $9.4 billion, compared to $10.0 billion in 2017. The operating cash flow performance primarily reflects discretionary contributions of $1.5 billion to our pension and retiree medical plans in 2018, partially offset by lower net cash tax payments in 2018. Investing Activities During 2019 , net cash used for investing activities was $6.4 billion , primarily reflecting $4.1 billion of net capital spending, as well as $1.9 billion of the remaining cash paid in connection with our acquisition of SodaStream. 63 Table of Contents During 2018, net cash provided by investing activities was $4.6 billion, primarily reflecting net maturities and sales of debt securities with maturities greater than three months of $8.7 billion, partially offset by net capital spending of $3.1 billion and $1.2 billion of cash paid, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired, in connection with our acquisition of SodaStream. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of capital spending by division; see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our investments in debt securities. We expect 2020 net capital spending to be approximately $5 billion . Financing Activities During 2019 , net cash used for financing activities was $8.5 billion , primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases of $8.3 billion, payments of long-term debt borrowings of $4.0 billion and debt redemptions of $1.0 billion, partially offset by proceeds from issuances of long-term debt of $4.6 billion. During 2018, net cash used for financing activities was $13.8 billion, primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases of $6.9 billion, payments of long-term debt borrowings of $4.0 billion, cash tender and exchange offers of $1.6 billion and net payments of short-term borrowings of $1.4 billion. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of debt obligations. We annually review our capital structure with our Board of Directors, including our dividend policy and share repurchase activity. On February 13, 2018, we announced the 2018 share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $15.0 billion of PepsiCo common stock which commenced on July 1, 2018 and will expire on June 30, 2021. On February 13, 2020 , we announced a 7% increase in our annualized dividend to $4.09 per share from $3.82 per share, effective with the dividend expected to be paid in June 2020 . We expect to return a total of approximately $7.5 billion to shareholders in 2020 through share repurchases of approximately $2 billion and dividends of approximately $5.5 billion. Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on free cash flow see “Non-GAAP Measures.” The table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities, as reflected in our cash flow statement, to our free cash flow. % Change 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 9,649 $ 9,415 $ 10,030 2.5 (6 ) Capital spending (4,232 ) (3,282 ) (2,969 ) Sales of property, plant and equipment 170 134 180 Free cash flow $ 5,587 $ 6,267 $ 7,241 (11 ) (13 ) We use free cash flow primarily for financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. We expect to continue to return free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global capital and credit markets at favorable interest rates. However, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Our Business Risks” for certain factors that may impact our credit ratings or our operating cash flows. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, whether or not as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increase our 64 Table of Contents future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Our Business Risks” and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Credit Facilities and Long-Term Contractual Commitments See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our credit facilities. The following table summarizes our long-term contractual commitments by period: Payments Due by Period (a) Total 2020 2021 – 2022 2023 – 2024 2025 and beyond Recorded Liabilities: Long-term debt obligations (b) $ 29,142 $ — $ 7,156 $ 3,110 $ 18,876 Operating leases (c) 1,763 501 654 300 308 One-time mandatory transition tax - TCJ Act (d) 3,317 75 617 888 1,737 Other: Interest on debt obligations (e) 12,403 996 1,730 1,388 8,289 Purchasing commitments (f) 2,032 874 844 213 101 Marketing commitments (g) 1,308 403 548 188 169 Total contractual commitments $ 49,965 $ 2,849 $ 11,549 $ 6,087 $ 29,480 (a) Based on year-end foreign exchange rates. (b) Excludes $2,848 million related to current maturities of debt, $6 million related to the fair value adjustments for debt acquired in acquisitions and interest rate swaps and payments of $163 million related to unamortized net discounts. (c) Primarily reflects building leases. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on operating leases. (d) Reflects our transition tax liability as of December 28, 2019 , which must be paid through 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act. (e) Interest payments on floating-rate debt are estimated using interest rates effective as of December 28, 2019 . Includes accrued interest of $ 305 million as of December 28, 2019. (f) Reflects non-cancelable commitments, primarily for the purchase of commodities and outsourcing services in the normal course of business and does not include purchases that we are likely to make based on our plans, but are not obligated to incur. (g) Reflects non-cancelable commitments, primarily for sports marketing in the normal course of business. Reserves for uncertain tax positions are excluded from the table above as we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of any such settlements. Bottler funding to independent bottlers is not reflected in the table above as it is negotiated on an annual basis. Accrued liabilities for pension and retiree medical plans are not reflected in the table above. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our pension and retiree medical obligations. Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements We do not have guarantees or other off-balance-sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity. We coordinate, on an aggregate basis, the contract negotiations of raw material requirements, including sweeteners, aluminum cans and plastic bottles and closures for us and certain of our independent bottlers. Once we have negotiated the contracts, the bottlers order and take delivery directly from the supplier and pay the suppliers directly. Consequently, transactions between our independent bottlers and suppliers are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. As the contracting party, we could be liable to these suppliers in the event of any nonpayment by our independent bottlers, but we consider this exposure to be remote. 65 Table of Contents Return on Invested Capital ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure.

Selected Financial Data” for further information. OUR CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES An appreciation of our critical accounting policies is necessary to understand our financial results. These policies may require management to make difficult and subjective judgments regarding uncertainties, and as a result, such estimates may significantly impact our financial results. The precision of these estimates and the likelihood of future changes depend on a number of underlying variables and a range of possible outcomes. Other than our accounting for pension and retiree medical plans, our critical accounting policies do not involve a choice between alternative methods of accounting. We applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all material respects and for all periods presented. We have discussed our critical accounting policies with our Audit Committee. 66 Table of Contents Our critical accounting policies are: • revenue recognition; • goodwill and other intangible assets; • income tax expense and accruals; and • pension and retiree medical plans. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when our performance obligation is satisfied. Our primary performance obligation (the distribution and sales of beverage products and food and snack products) is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to our customers, which is also when control is transferred. The transfer of control of products to our customers is typically based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return. However, our policy for DSD and certain chilled products is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect. Similarly, our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. As a result, we record reserves, based on estimates, for anticipated damaged and out-of-date products. Our products are sold for cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry practices, typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the United States, and generally within 30 to 90 days internationally, and may allow discounts for early payment. We estimate and reserve for our bad debt exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility, write-off history, the aging of accounts receivable and our analysis of customer data. Our policy is to provide customers with product when needed. In fact, our commitment to freshness and product dating serves to regulate the quantity of product shipped or delivered. In addition, DSD products are placed on the shelf by our employees with customer shelf space and storerooms limiting the quantity of product. For product delivered through other distribution networks, we monitor customer inventory levels. As discussed in “Our Customers” in “Item 1. Business,” we offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to customers for performing activities on our behalf, such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new products, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices. Sales incentives and discounts also include support provided to our independent bottlers through funding of advertising and other marketing activities. A number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur after year-end once reconciled and settled. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our revenue recognition and related policies, including total marketplace spending. 67 Table of Contents Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We sell products under a number of brand names, many of which were developed by us. Brand development costs are expensed as incurred. We also purchase brands and other intangible assets in acquisitions. In a business combination, the consideration is first assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities, including brands and other intangible assets, based on estimated fair values, with any excess recorded as goodwill. Determining fair value requires significant estimates and assumptions based on an evaluation of a number of factors, such as marketplace participants, product life cycles, market share, consumer awareness, brand history and future expansion expectations, amount and timing of future cash flows and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. We believe that a brand has an indefinite life if it has a history of strong revenue and cash flow performance and we have the intent and ability to support the brand with marketplace spending for the foreseeable future. If these indefinite-lived brand criteria are not met, brands are amortized over their expected useful lives, which generally range from 20 to 40 years. Determining the expected life of a brand requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors, including market share, consumer awareness, brand history, future expansion expectations and regulatory restrictions, as well as the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brand is sold. In connection with previous acquisitions, we reacquired certain franchise rights which provided the exclusive and perpetual rights to manufacture and/or distribute beverages for sale in specified territories. In determining the useful life of these franchise rights, many factors were considered, including the pre-existing perpetual bottling arrangements, the indefinite period expected for these franchise rights to contribute to our future cash flows, as well as the lack of any factors that would limit the useful life of these franchise rights to us, including legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors. Therefore, certain of these franchise rights are considered as indefinite-lived. Franchise rights that are not considered indefinite-lived are amortized over the remaining contractual period of the contract in which the right was granted. Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and, as a result, are assessed for impairment at least annually, using either a qualitative or quantitative approach. We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Where we use the qualitative assessment, first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered include macroeconomic, industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environment, historical financial performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed. In the quantitative assessment for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, estimated fair value is determined using discounted cash flows and requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with management’s strategic business plans, annual sales growth rates, perpetuity growth assumptions and the selection of assumptions underlying a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. Significant management judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeconomic and other factors to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, such as forecasted growth rates and weighted-average cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. These assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain of the risks described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Our Business Risks.” 68 Table of Contents Amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows. See Note 2 and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Income Tax Expense and Accruals Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax structure and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we likely will not succeed. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit, new tax laws or tax authority settlements. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion. An estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to our quarterly operating results. In the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the same time as that item. We consider the tax adjustments from the resolution of prior-year tax matters to be among such items. Tax law requires items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our consolidated financial statements. As a result, our annual tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different than that reported in our tax returns (our cash tax rate). Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit on our consolidated financial statements. We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our consolidated financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but have not yet recognized as expense in our consolidated financial statements. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. Among its many provisions, the TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings and reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% , effective January 1, 2018. As a result of the enactment of the TCJ Act, we recognized a provisional net tax expense of $2.5 billion ( $1.70 per share) in the fourth quarter of 2017. We recorded a net tax benefit of $28 million ( $0.02 per share) in 2018, related to the TCJ Act. Our provisional measurement period ended in the fourth quarter of 2018 and while our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act was deemed to be complete, additional guidance issued by the IRS impacted, and may continue to impact, our recorded amounts after December 29, 2018. In 2019, we recognized a net tax benefit totaling $8 million ( $0.01 per share) related to the TCJ Act, including the impact of additional guidance issued by the IRS in the first quarter of 2019 and adjustments related to the filing of our 2018 U.S. federal tax return. See further information in “Items Affecting Comparability.” On May 19, 2019, a public referendum held in Switzerland passed the TRAF , effective January 1, 2020. The enactment of certain provisions of the TRAF in 2019 resulted in adjustments to our deferred taxes. During 2019 , we recorded net tax expense of $24 million related to the impact of the TRAF. Enactment of the TRAF provisions subsequent to December 28, 2019 is expected to result in adjustments to our consolidated financial 69 Table of Contents statements and related disclosures in future periods. The future impact of the TRAF cannot currently be reasonably estimated; we will continue to monitor and assess the impact the TRAF may have on our business and financial results. In 2019 , our annual tax rate was 21.0% compared to (36.7)% in 2018 , as discussed in “Other Consolidated Results.” The tax rate increased 57.7 percentage points compared to 2018 , primarily reflecting the prior-year other net tax benefits related to the reorganization of our international operations, which increased the current-year reported tax rate by 47 percentage points. Additionally, the prior-year favorable conclusion of certain international tax audits and the favorable resolution with the IRS of all open matters related to the audits of taxable years 2012 and 2013, collectively, increased the current-year reported tax rate by 8 percentage points. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. Pension and Retiree Medical Plans Our pension plans cover certain employees in the United States and certain international employees. Benefits are determined based on either years of service or a combination of years of service and earnings. Certain U.S. and Canada retirees are also eligible for medical and life insurance benefits (retiree medical) if they meet age and service requirements. Generally, our share of retiree medical costs is capped at specified dollar amounts, which vary based upon years of service, with retirees contributing the remainder of the cost. In addition, we have been phasing out certain subsidies of retiree medical benefits. In 2019, Plan A purchased a group annuity contract whereby a third-party insurance company assumed the obligation to pay and administer future annuity payments for certain retirees. This transaction triggered a pre-tax settlement charge in 2019 of $220 million ( $170 million after-tax or $0.12 per share). Also in 2019, certain former employees who had vested benefits in our U.S. defined benefit pension plans were offered the option of receiving a one-time lump sum payment equal to the present value of the participant’s pension benefit. This transaction triggered a pre-tax settlement charge in 2019 of $53 million ( $41 million after-tax or $0.03 per share). Collectively, the group annuity contract and one-time lump sum payments to certain former employees who had vested benefits resulted in settlement charges in 2019 of $273 million ($211 million after-tax or $0.15 per share). Effective January 1, 2017, the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans were reorganized into Plan A and the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan I (Plan I) to facilitate a targeted investment strategy over time and provide additional flexibility in evaluating opportunities to reduce risk and volatility. Actuarial gains and losses associated with Plan A are amortized over the average remaining service life of the active participants, while the actuarial gains and losses associated with Plan I are amortized over the remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants. As a result of these changes, the pre-tax net periodic benefit cost decreased by $42 million ($27 million after-tax, reflecting tax rates effective for the 2017 tax year, or $0.02 per share) in 2017, primarily impacting corporate unallocated expenses. See “Items Affecting Comparability” and Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. Our Assumptions The determination of pension and retiree medical expenses and obligations requires the use of assumptions to estimate the amount of benefits that employees earn while working, as well as the present value of those benefits. Annual pension and retiree medical expense amounts are principally based on four components: (1) the value of benefits earned by employees for working during the year (service cost), (2) the increase in the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time (interest cost), and (3) other gains and losses as discussed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, reduced by (4) the expected return on assets for our funded plans. 70 Table of Contents Significant assumptions used to measure our annual pension and retiree medical expenses include: • certain employee-related demographic factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; • the expected return on assets in our funded plans; • for pension expense, the rate of salary increases for plans where benefits are based on earnings; • for retiree medical expense, health care cost trend rates; and • for pension and retiree medical expense, the spot rates along the yield curve used to determine service and interest costs and the present value of liabilities. Certain assumptions reflect our historical experience and management’s best judgment regarding future expectations. All actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually, except in the case of an interim remeasurement due to a significant event such as a curtailment or settlement. Due to the significant management judgment involved, these assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension and retiree medical expenses and obligations. At each measurement date, the discount rates are based on interest rates for high-quality, long-term corporate debt securities with maturities comparable to those of our liabilities. Our U.S. obligation and pension and retiree medical expense is based on the discount rates determined using the Mercer Above Mean Curve. This curve includes bonds that closely match the timing and amount of our expected benefit payments and reflects the portfolio of investments we would consider to settle our liabilities. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for information about the expected rate of return on plan assets and our plans’ investment strategy. Although we review our expected long-term rates of return on an annual basis, our asset returns in a given year do not significantly influence our evaluation of long-term rates of return. The health care trend rate used to determine our retiree medical plans’ liability and expense is reviewed annually. Our review is based on our claims experience, information provided by our health plans and actuaries, and our knowledge of the health care industry. Our review of the trend rate considers factors such as demographics, plan design, new medical technologies and changes in medical carriers. Weighted-average assumptions for pension and retiree medical expense are as follows: 2020 2019 2018 Pension Service cost discount rate 3.4 % 4.4 % 3.7 % Interest cost discount rate 2.8 % 3.9 % 3.2 % Expected rate of return on plan assets 6.6 % 6.8 % 6.9 % Expected rate of salary increases 3.2 % 3.2 % 3.2 % Retiree medical Service cost discount rate 3.2 % 4.3 % 3.6 % Interest cost discount rate 2.6 % 3.8 % 3.0 % Expected rate of return on plan assets 5.8 % 6.6 % 6.5 % Current health care cost trend rate 5.6 % 5.7 % 5.8 % In 2019, we incurred pension settlement charges related to the purchase of a group annuity contract of $220 million and one-time lump sum settlements of $53 million to certain former employees who had vested benefits. In addition, based on our assumptions, we expect our total pension and retiree medical expense to decrease in 2020 primarily driven by the recognition of fixed income gains on plan assets and the impact of approved plan contributions, primarily offset by the decrease in discount rates. 71 Table of Contents Sensitivity of Assumptions A decrease in each of the collective discount rates or in the expected rate of return assumptions would increase expense for our benefit plans. A 25-basis-point decrease in each of the above discount rates and expected rate of return assumptions would individually increase 2020 pre-tax pension and retiree medical expense as follows: Assumption Amount Discount rates used in the calculation of expense $ 48 Expected rate of return $ 44 Funding We make contributions to pension trusts that provide plan benefits for certain pension plans. These contributions are made in accordance with applicable tax regulations that provide for current tax deductions for our contributions and taxation to the employee only upon receipt of plan benefits. Generally, we do not fund our pension plans when our contributions would not be currently tax deductible. As our retiree medical plans are not subject to regulatory funding requirements, we generally fund these plans on a pay-as-you-go basis, although we periodically review available options to make additional contributions toward these benefits. We made discretionary contributions to Plan A in the United States of $150 million in January 2020, $400 million in 2019 and $1.4 billion in 2018. Our pension and retiree medical contributions are subject to change as a result of many factors, such as changes in interest rates, deviations between actual and expected asset returns and changes in tax or other benefit laws. We regularly evaluate different opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for our past and expected contributions and estimated future benefit payments. 72 Table of Contents Consolidated Statement of Income PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries Fiscal years ended December 28, 2019 , December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 (in millions except per share amounts) 2019 2018 2017 Net Revenue $ 67,161 $ 64,661 $ 63,525 Cost of sales 30,132 29,381 28,796 Gross profit 37,029 35,280 34,729 Selling, general and administrative expenses 26,738 25,170 24,453 Operating Profit 10,291 10,110 10,276 Other pension and retiree medical benefits (expense)/income ( 44 ) 298 233 Interest expense ( 1,135 ) ( 1,525 ) ( 1,151 ) Interest income and other 200 306 244 Income before income taxes 9,312 9,189 9,602 Provision for/(benefit from) income taxes (See Note 5) 1,959 ( 3,370 ) 4,694 Net income 7,353 12,559 4,908 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 39 44 51 Net Income Attributable to PepsiCo $ 7,314 $ 12,515 $ 4,857 Net Income Attributable to PepsiCo per Common Share Basic $ 5.23 $ 8.84 $ 3.40 Diluted $ 5.20 $ 8.78 $ 3.38 Weighted-average common shares outstanding Basic 1,399 1,415 1,425 Diluted 1,407 1,425 1,438 See accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. 73 Table of Contents Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries Fiscal years ended December 28, 2019 , December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 (in millions) 2019 2018 2017 Net income $ 7,353 $ 12,559 $ 4,908 Other comprehensive income/(loss), net of taxes: Net currency translation adjustment 628 ( 1,641 ) 1,109 Net change on cash flow hedges ( 90 ) 40 ( 36 ) Net pension and retiree medical adjustments 283 ( 467 ) ( 159 ) Net change on available-for-sale securities ( 2 ) 6 ( 68 ) Other — — 16 819 ( 2,062 ) 862 Comprehensive income 8,172 10,497 5,770 Comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests ( 39 ) ( 44 ) ( 51 ) Comprehensive Income Attributable to PepsiCo $ 8,133 $ 10,453 $ 5,719 See accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. 74 Table of Contents Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries Fiscal years ended December 28, 2019 , December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 (in millions) 2019 2018 2017 Operating Activities Net income $ 7,353 $ 12,559 $ 4,908 Depreciation and amortization 2,432 2,399 2,369 Share-based compensation expense 237 256 292 Restructuring and impairment charges 370 308 295 Cash payments for restructuring charges ( 350 ) ( 255 ) ( 113 ) Pension and retiree medical plan expenses 519 221 221 Pension and retiree medical plan contributions ( 716 ) ( 1,708 ) ( 220 ) Deferred income taxes and other tax charges and credits 453 ( 531 ) 619 Net tax related to the TCJ Act ( 8 ) ( 28 ) 2,451 Tax payments related to the TCJ Act ( 423 ) ( 115 ) — Other net tax benefits related to international reorganizations ( 2 ) ( 4,347 ) — Change in assets and liabilities: Accounts and notes receivable ( 650 ) ( 253 ) ( 202 ) Inventories ( 190 ) ( 174 ) ( 168 ) Prepaid expenses and other current assets ( 87 ) 9 20 Accounts payable and other current liabilities 735 882 201 Income taxes payable ( 287 ) 448 ( 338 ) Other, net 263 ( 256 ) ( 305 ) Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 9,649 9,415 10,030 Investing Activities Capital spending ( 4,232 ) ( 3,282 ) ( 2,969 ) Sales of property, plant and equipment 170 134 180 Acquisition of SodaStream, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired ( 1,939 ) ( 1,197 ) — Other acquisitions and investments in noncontrolled affiliates ( 778 ) ( 299 ) ( 61 ) Divestitures 253 505 267 Short-term investments, by original maturity: More than three months -

In addition, we include our share of the results of certain other affiliates using the equity method based on our economic ownership interest, our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating or financial decisions of these affiliates or our ability to direct their economic resources. We do not control these other affiliates, as our ownership in these other affiliates is generally 50 % or less. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. As a result of exchange restrictions and other operating restrictions, we do not have control over our Venezuelan subsidiaries. As such, our Venezuelan subsidiaries are not included within our consolidated financial results for any period presented. Raw materials, direct labor and plant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, costs directly related to production planning, inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities, are included in cost of sales. The costs of moving, storing and delivering finished product, including merchandising activities, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are used in determining, among other items, sales incentives accruals, tax reserves, share-based compensation, pension and retiree medical accruals, amounts and useful lives for intangible assets and future cash flows associated with impairment testing for indefinite-lived brands, goodwill and other long-lived assets. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience, as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances, such as current economic conditions, and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change. As future events and their effect cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of each December, resulting in an additional week of results every five or six years. While our North America results are reported on a weekly calendar basis, substantially all of our international operations report on a monthly calendar basis. Certain operations in our Europe segment report on a weekly calendar basis. The following chart details our quarterly reporting schedule for the three years presented: Quarter United States and Canada International First Quarter 12 weeks January, February Second Quarter 12 weeks March, April and May Third Quarter 12 weeks June, July and August Fourth Quarter 16 weeks September, October, November and December Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Certain reclassifications were made to the prior years’ consolidated financial statements to conform to the current year presentation. Our Divisions During the fourth quarter of 2019, we realigned our ESSA and AMENA reportable segments to be consistent 78 Table of Contents with a recent strategic realignment of our organizational structure and how our Chief Executive Officer assesses the performance of, and allocates resources to, our reportable segments. As a result, our beverage, food and snack businesses in North Africa, the Middle East and South Asia that were part of our former AMENA segment and our businesses in Sub-Saharan Africa that were part of our former ESSA segment are now reported together as our AMESA segment. The remaining beverage, food and snack businesses that were part of our former AMENA segment are now reported together as our APAC segment and our beverage, food and snack businesses in Europe are now reported as our Europe segment. These changes did not impact our FLNA, QFNA, PBNA or LatAm reportable segments or our consolidated financial results. Our historical segment reporting presented in this report has been retrospectively revised to reflect the new organizational structure. We are organized into seven reportable segments (also referred to as divisions), as follows: 1) FLNA, which includes our branded food and snack businesses in the United States and Canada; 2) QFNA, which includes our cereal, rice, pasta and other branded food businesses in the United States and Canada; 3) PBNA, which includes our beverage businesses in the United States and Canada; 4) LatAm, which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Latin America; 5) Europe, which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Europe; 6) AMESA, which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Africa, the Middle East and South Asia; and 7) APAC, which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Asia Pacific, Australia and New Zealand and China region. Through our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a wide variety of convenient beverages, foods and snacks, serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories with our largest operations in the United States, Mexico, Russia, Canada, the United Kingdom, China and Brazil . The accounting policies for the divisions are the same as those described in Note 2, except for the following allocation methodologies: • share-based compensation expense; • pension and retiree medical expense; and • derivatives. Share-Based Compensation Expense Our divisions are held accountable for share-based compensation expense and, therefore, this expense is allocated to our divisions as an incremental employee compensation cost. 79 Table of Contents The allocation of share-based compensation expense of each division is as follows: 2019 2018 2017 FLNA 13 % 13 % 13 % QFNA 1 % 1 % 1 % PBNA 17 % 18 % 18 % LatAm 7 % 8 % 7 % Europe 17 % 9 % 9 % AMESA 3 % 4 % 5 % APAC 5 % 4 % 4 % Corporate unallocated expenses 37 % 43 % 43 % The expense allocated to our divisions excludes any impact of changes in our assumptions during the year which reflect market conditions over which division management has no control. Therefore, any variances between allocated expense and our actual expense are recognized in corporate unallocated expenses. Pension and Retiree Medical Expense Pension and retiree medical service costs measured at fixed discount rates are reflected in division results. The variance between the fixed discount rate used to determine the service cost reflected in division results and the discount rate as disclosed in Note 7 is reflected in corporate unallocated expenses. Derivatives We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include energy, agricultural products and metals . Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in corporate unallocated expenses. These derivatives hedge underlying commodity price risk and were not entered into for trading or speculative purposes. Net revenue and operating profit of each division are as follows: Net Revenue Operating Profit 2019 (a) 2018 (a) 2017 2019 2018 2017 FLNA $ 17,078 $ 16,346 $ 15,798 $ 5,258 $ 5,008 $ 4,793 QFNA 2,482 2,465 2,503 544 637 640 PBNA 21,730 21,072 20,936 2,179 2,276 2,700 LatAm 7,573 7,354 7,208 1,141 1,049 924 Europe 11,728 10,973 10,522 1,327 1,256 1,199 AMESA 3,651 3,657 3,674 671 661 789 APAC 2,919 2,794 2,884 477 619 401 Total division 67,161 64,661 63,525 11,597 11,506 11,446 Corporate unallocated expenses — — — ( 1,306 ) ( 1,396 ) ( 1,170 ) Total $ 67,161 $ 64,661 $ 63,525 $ 10,291 $ 10,110 $ 10,276 (a) Our primary performance obligation is the distribution and sales of beverage products and food and snack products to our customers, with our food and snack business representing approximately 55 % of our consolidated net revenue. Internationally, LatAm’s food and snack business is approximately 90 % of the segment’s net revenue, Europe’s beverage business and food and snack business are approximately 55 % and 45 % , respectively, of the segment’s net revenue, AMESA’s beverage business and food and snack business are approximately 40 % and 60 % , respectively, of the segment’s net revenue and APAC’s beverage business and food and snack business are approximately 25 % and 75 % , respectively, of the segment’s net revenue. Beverage revenue from company-owned bottlers, which primarily includes our consolidated bottling operations in our PBNA and Europe segments, is approximately 40 % of our consolidated net revenue. Generally, our 80 Table of Contents finished goods beverage operations produce higher net revenue, but lower operating margins as compared to concentrate sold to authorized bottling partners for the manufacture of finished goods beverages. See Note 2 for further information. Corporate Unallocated Expenses Corporate unallocated expenses include costs of our corporate headquarters, centrally managed initiatives such as commodity derivative gains and losses, foreign exchange transaction gains and losses, our ongoing business transformation initiatives, unallocated research and development costs, unallocated insurance and benefit programs, and certain other items. Other Division Information Total assets and capital spending of each division are as follows: Total Assets Capital Spending 2019 2018 2019 2018 2017 FLNA $ 7,519 $ 6,577 $ 1,227 $ 840 $ 665 QFNA 941 870 104 53 44 PBNA 31,449 29,878 1,053 945 904 LatAm 7,007 6,458 557 492 481 Europe 17,814 16,887 613 466 463 AMESA 3,672 3,252 267 198 181 APAC 4,113 3,704 195 138 145 Total division 72,515 67,626 4,016 3,132 2,883 Corporate (a) 6,032 10,022 216 150 86 Total $ 78,547 $ 77,648 $ 4,232 $ 3,282 $ 2,969 (a) Corporate assets consist principally of certain cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments, derivative instruments, property, plant and equipment and tax assets. In 2019 , the change in assets was primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash. Refer to the cash flow statement for additional information. Amortization of intangible assets and depreciation and other amortization of each division are as follows: Amortization of Intangible Assets Depreciation and Other Amortization 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 2017 FLNA $ 7 $ 7 $ 7 $ 492 $ 457 $ 449 QFNA — — — 44 45 47 PBNA 29 31 31 857 821 780 LatAm 5 5 5 270 253 245 Europe 37 23 22 341 319 317 AMESA 2 2 2 116 169 170 APAC 1 1 1 76 80 99 Total division 81 69 68 2,196 2,144 2,107 Corporate — — — 155 186 194 Total $ 81 $ 69 $ 68 $ 2,351 $ 2,330 $ 2,301 81 Table of Contents Net revenue and long-lived assets by country are as follows: Net Revenue Long-Lived Assets (a) 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 United States $ 38,644 $ 37,148 $ 36,546 $ 30,601 $ 29,169 Mexico 4,190 3,878 3,650 1,666 1,404 Russia 3,263 3,191 3,232 4,314 3,926 Canada 2,831 2,736 2,691 2,695 2,565 United Kingdom 1,723 1,743 1,650 827 759 China 1,300 1,164 963 705 509 Brazil 1,295 1,335 1,427 590 639 All other countries 13,915 13,466 13,366 12,134 11,660 Total $ 67,161 $ 64,661 $ 63,525 $ 53,532 $ 50,631 (a) Long-lived assets represent property, plant and equipment, indefinite-lived intangible assets, amortizable intangible assets and investments in noncontrolled affiliates. These assets are reported in the country where they are primarily used. Note 2 — Our Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when our performance obligation is satisfied. Our primary performance obligation (the distribution and sales of beverage products and food and snack products) is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to our customers, which is also when control is transferred. Merchandising activities are performed after a customer obtains control of the product, are accounted for as fulfillment of our performance obligation to ship or deliver product to our customers and are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Merchandising activities are immaterial in the context of our contracts. The transfer of control of products to our customers is typically based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return. However, our policy for DSD and certain chilled products is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect. Similarly, our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. As a result, we record reserves, based on estimates, for anticipated damaged and out-of-date products. As a result of the implementation of the revenue recognition guidance adopted in the first quarter of 2018, which did not have a material impact on our accounting policies, we recorded an adjustment in the first quarter of 2018 of $ 137 million to beginning retained earnings to reflect marketplace spending that our customers and independent bottlers expect to be entitled to in line with revenue recognition. In addition, starting in 2018, we excluded from net revenue and cost of sales all sales, use, value-added and certain excise taxes assessed by governmental authorities on revenue-producing transactions. The impact of these taxes previously recognized in net revenue and cost of sales was approximately $ 75 million for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2017, with no impact on operating profit. Our products are sold for cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry practices, typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the United States, and generally within 30 to 90 days internationally, and may allow discounts for early payment. We estimate and reserve for our bad debt exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility, write-off history, the aging of accounts receivable and our analysis of customer data. Bad debt expense is classified within selling, general and administrative expenses on our income statement. 82 Table of Contents We are exposed to concentration of credit risk from our major customers, including Walmart. In 2019 , sales to Walmart and its affiliates (including Sam’s) represented approximately 13 % of our consolidated net revenue, including concentrate sales to our independent bottlers, which were used in finished goods sold by them to Walmart. We have not experienced credit issues with these customers. Total Marketplace Spending We offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to customers for performing activities on our behalf, such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new products, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices. Sales incentives and discounts also include support provided to our independent bottlers through funding of advertising and other marketing activities. A number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for the expected payout, which may occur after year end once reconciled and settled. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer and consumer participation and performance levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred. The terms of most of our incentive arrangements do not exceed a year, and, therefore, do not require highly uncertain long-term estimates. Certain arrangements, such as fountain pouring rights, may extend beyond one year. Upfront payments to customers under these arrangements are recognized over the shorter of the economic or contractual life, primarily as a reduction of revenue, and the remaining balances of $ 272 million as of December 28, 2019 and $ 218 million as of December 29, 2018 are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on our balance sheet. For interim reporting, our policy is to allocate our forecasted full-year sales incentives for most of our programs to each of our interim reporting periods in the same year that benefits from the programs. The allocation methodology is based on our forecasted sales incentives for the full year and the proportion of each interim period’s actual gross revenue or volume, as applicable, to our forecasted annual gross revenue or volume, as applicable. Based on our review of the forecasts at each interim period, any changes in estimates and the related allocation of sales incentives are recognized beginning in the interim period that they are identified. In addition, we apply a similar allocation methodology for interim reporting purposes for certain advertising and other marketing activities. Our annual consolidated financial statements are not impacted by this interim allocation methodology. Advertising and other marketing activities, reported as selling, general and administrative expenses, totaled $ 4.7 billion in 2019 , $ 4.2 billion in 2018 and $ 4.1 billion in 2017 , including advertising expenses of $ 3.0 billion in 2019 , $ 2.6 billion in 2018 and $ 2.4 billion in 2017 . Deferred advertising costs are not expensed until the year first used and consist of: • media and personal service prepayments; • promotional materials in inventory; and • production costs of future media advertising. Deferred advertising costs of $ 55 million and $ 47 million as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 , respectively, are classified as prepaid expenses and other current assets on our balance sheet. 83 Table of Contents Distribution Costs Distribution costs, including the costs of shipping and handling activities, which include certain merchandising activities, are reported as selling, general and administrative expenses. Shipping and handling expenses were $ 10.9 billion in 2019 , $ 10.5 billion in 2018 and $ 9.9 billion in 2017 . Software Costs We capitalize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use when both the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable that the software will be used as intended. Capitalized software costs include (1) external direct costs of materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining computer software, (2) compensation and related benefits for employees who are directly associated with the software projects and (3) interest costs incurred while developing internal-use computer software. Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and equipment on our balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis when placed into service over the estimated useful lives of the software, which approximate five to 10 years. Software amortization totaled $ 166 million in 2019 , $ 204 million in 2018 and $ 224 million in 2017 . Net capitalized software and development costs were $ 572 million and $ 577 million as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 , respectively. Commitments and Contingencies We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, certain taxes and environmental matters, as well as commitments under contractual and other commercial obligations. We recognize liabilities for contingencies and commitments when a loss is probable and estimable. Research and Development We engage in a variety of research and development activities and continue to invest to accelerate growth and to drive innovation globally. Consumer research is excluded from research and development costs and included in other marketing costs. Research and development costs were $ 711 million , $ 680 million and $ 737 million in 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , respectively, and are reported within selling, general and administrative expenses. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and, as a result, are assessed for impairment at least annually, using either a qualitative or quantitative approach. We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Where we use the qualitative assessment, first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered include macroeconomic, industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environment, historical financial performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed. In the quantitative assessment for indefinite lived-intangible assets and goodwill, an assessment is performed to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and the reporting unit, respectively. Estimated fair value is determined using discounted cash flows and requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with management’s strategic business plans, annual sales growth rates, perpetuity growth assumptions and the selection of assumptions underlying a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. Significant management judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeconomic and other factors to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, such as forecasted growth rates (including perpetuity growth assumptions) and weighted-average cost of capital, are based on the best available market 84 Table of Contents information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. A deterioration in these assumptions could adversely impact our results. Amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows. See Note 4 for further information. Other Significant Accounting Policies Our other significant accounting policies are disclosed as follows: • Basis of Presentation – Note 1 includes a description of our policies regarding use of estimates, basis of presentation and consolidation. • Property, Plant and Equipment – Note 4. • Income Taxes – Note 5. • Share-Based Compensation – Note 6. • Pension, Retiree Medical and Savings Plans – Note 7. • Financial Instruments – Note 9. • Cash Equivalents – Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. • Inventories – Note 15. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the average; first-in, first-out (FIFO) or, in limited instances, last-in, first-out (LIFO) methods. • Translation of Financial Statements of Foreign Subsidiaries – Financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities and weighted-average exchange rates for revenues and expenses. Adjustments resulting from translating net assets are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders’ equity as currency translation adjustment. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements - Adopted In 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance related to the TCJ Act for the optional reclassification of the residual tax effects, arising from the change in corporate tax rate, in accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings. The reclassification is the difference between the amount previously recorded in other comprehensive income at the historical U.S. federal tax rate that remains in accumulated other comprehensive loss at the time the TCJ Act was effective and the amount that would have been recorded using the newly enacted rate. This guidance became effective during the first quarter of 2019; however, we did not elect to make the optional reclassification. In 2017, the FASB issued guidance to amend and simplify the application of hedge accounting guidance to better portray the economic results of risk management activities in the financial statements. The guidance expands the ability to hedge nonfinancial and financial risk components, reduces complexity in fair value hedges of interest rate risk, eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness, as well as eases certain hedge effectiveness assessment requirements. Under this guidance, certain of our derivatives used to hedge commodity price risk that did not previously qualify for hedge accounting treatment can now qualify prospectively. We adopted this guidance during the first quarter of 2019; the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures. See Note 9 for further information. In 2016, the FASB issued guidance on leases, with amendments issued in 2018. The guidance requires lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheet, but does not change the manner in which expenses are recorded 85 Table of Contents in the income statement. For lessors, the guidance modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases. The two permitted transition methods under the guidance are the modified retrospective transition approach, which requires application of the guidance for all comparative periods presented, and the cumulative effect adjustment approach, which requires prospective application at the adoption date. We utilized a comprehensive approach to assess the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures, including the increase in the assets and liabilities on our balance sheet and the impact on our current lease portfolio from both a lessor and lessee perspective. We completed our comprehensive review of our lease portfolio, including significant leases by geography and by asset type that were impacted by the new guidance, and enhanced our controls. In addition, we implemented a new software platform, and corresponding controls, for administering our leases and facilitating compliance with the new guidance. We adopted the guidance prospectively during the first quarter of 2019. As part of our adoption, we elected not to reassess historical lease classification, recognize short-term leases on our balance sheet, nor separate lease and non-lease components for our real estate leases. In addition, we utilized the portfolio approach to group leases with similar characteristics and did not use hindsight to determine lease term. The adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, resulting in an increase of 2 % to each of our total assets and total liabilities on our balance sheet, and had an immaterial increase to retained earnings as of the beginning of 2019. See Note 13 for further information. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements - Not Yet Adopted In 2019, the FASB issued guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes. The guidance primarily addresses how to (1) recognize a deferred tax liability after we transition to or from the equity method of accounting, (2) evaluate if a step–up in the tax basis of goodwill is related to a business combination or is a separate transaction, (3) recognize all the effects of a change in tax law in the period of enactment, including adjusting the estimated annual tax rate, and (4) include the amount of tax based on income in the income tax provision and any incremental amount as a tax not based on income for hybrid tax regimes. The guidance is effective in the first quarter of 2021 with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements and the timing of adoption. In 2016, the FASB issued guidance that changes the impairment model used to measure credit losses for most financial assets. For our trade, certain other receivables and certain other financial instruments, we will be required to use a new forward-looking expected credit loss model that will replace the existing incurred credit loss model, which would generally result in earlier recognition of allowances for credit losses. We will adopt the guidance when it becomes effective in the first quarter of 2020. The guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures. Note 3 — Restructuring and Impairment Charges A summary of our restructuring and impairment charges and other productivity initiatives is as follows: 2019 2018 2017 2019 Productivity Plan $ 370 $ 138 $ — 2014 Productivity Plan — 170 295 Total restructuring and impairment charges 370 308 295 Other productivity initiatives 3 8 16 Total restructuring and impairment charges and other productivity initiatives $ 373 $ 316 $ 311 86 Table of Contents 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan The 2019 Productivity Plan, publicly announced on February 15, 2019, will leverage new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. In connection with this plan, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $ 2.5 billion and cash expenditures of approximately $ 1.6 billion . These pre-tax charges are expected to consist of approximately 70 % of severance and other employee-related costs, 15 % for asset impairments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related actions, and 15 % for other costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives. We expect to complete this plan by 2023. The total expected plan pre-tax charges are expected to be incurred by division approximately as follows: FLNA QFNA PBNA LatAm Europe AMESA APAC Corporate Expected pre-tax charges 11 % 2 % 30 % 10 % 25 % 8 % 5 % 9 % A summary of our 2019 Productivity Plan charges is as follows: 2019 2018 Cost of sales $ 115 $ 3 Selling, general and administrative expenses 253 100 Other pension and retiree medical benefits expense 2 35 Total restructuring and impairment charges $ 370 $ 138 After-tax amount $ 303 $ 109 Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share $ 0.21 $ 0.08 2019 2018 Plan to Date through 12/28/2019 FLNA $ 22 $ 31 $ 53 QFNA 2 5 7 PBNA 51 40 91 LatAm 62 9 71 Europe 99 6 105 AMESA 38 3 41 APAC 47 2 49 Corporate 47 7 54 368 103 471 Other pension and retiree medical benefits expense 2 35 37 Total $ 370 $ 138 $ 508 Plan to Date through 12/28/2019 Severance and other employee costs $ 286 Asset impairments 92 Other costs (a) 130 Total $ 508 (a) Includes other costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives, including contract termination costs, consulting and other professional fees. 87 Table of Contents A summary of our 2019 Productivity Plan activity is as follows: Severance and Other Employee Costs Asset Impairments Other Costs Total 2018 restructuring charges $ 137 $ — $ 1 $ 138 Non-cash charges and translation ( 32 ) — — ( 32 ) Liability as of December 29, 2018 105 — 1 106 2019 restructuring charges 149 92 129 370 Cash payments (a) ( 138 ) — ( 119 ) ( 257 ) Non-cash charges and translation 12 ( 92 ) 10 ( 70 ) Liability as of December 28, 2019 $ 128 $ — $ 21 $ 149 (a) Excludes cash expenditures of $ 4 million reported in the cash flow statement in pension and retiree medical contributions. Substantially all of the restructuring accrual at December 28, 2019 is expected to be paid by the end of 2020 . 2014 Multi-Year Productivity Plan The 2014 Productivity Plan, publicly announced on February 13, 2014, included the next generation of productivity initiatives that we believed would strengthen our beverage, food and snack businesses by: accelerating our investment in manufacturing automation; further optimizing our global manufacturing footprint, including closing certain manufacturing facilities; re-engineering our go-to-market systems in developed markets; expanding shared services; and implementing simplified organization structures to drive efficiency. To build on the 2014 Productivity Plan, in the fourth quarter of 2017, we expanded and extended the plan through the end of 2019 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives described above that further strengthened our beverage, food and snack businesses. The 2014 Productivity Plan was completed in 2019. In 2019, there were no material pre-tax charges related to this plan and all cash payments were paid at year end. The total plan pre-tax charges and cash expenditures approximated the previously disclosed plan estimates of $ 1.3 billion and $ 960 million , respectively. These total plan pre-tax charges consisted of 59 % of severance and other employee costs, 15 % of asset impairments and 26 % of other costs, including costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives, including certain consulting and other contract termination costs. These total plan pre-tax charges were incurred by division as follows: FLNA 14 % , QFNA 3 % , PBNA 29 % , LatAm 15 % , Europe 23 % , AMESA 3 % , APAC 3 % and Corporate 10 % .

Other Productivity Initiatives There were no material charges related to other productivity and efficiency initiatives outside the scope of the 2019 and 2014 Productivity Plans. We regularly evaluate different productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plans and other initiatives described above. 89 Table of Contents Note 4 — Property, Plant and Equipment and Intangible Assets A summary of our property, plant and equipment is as follows: Average Useful Life (Years) 2019 2018 2017 Property, plant and equipment, net Land $ 1,130 $ 1,078 Buildings and improvements 15 - 44 9,314 8,941 Machinery and equipment, including fleet and software 5 - 15 29,390 27,715 Construction in progress 3,169 2,430 43,003 40,164 Accumulated depreciation ( 23,698 ) ( 22,575 ) Total $ 19,305 $ 17,589 Depreciation expense $ 2,257 $ 2,241 $ 2,227 Property, plant and equipment is recorded at historical cost. Depreciation and amortization are recognized on a straight-line basis over an asset’s estimated useful life. Land is not depreciated and construction in progress is not depreciated until ready for service. A summary of our amortizable intangible assets is as follows: 2019 2018 2017 Average Useful Life (Years) Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Amortizable intangible assets, net Acquired franchise rights 56 – 60 $ 846 $ ( 158 ) $ 688 $ 838 $ ( 140 ) $ 698 Reacquired franchise rights 5 – 14 106 ( 105 ) 1 106 ( 105 ) 1 Brands 20 – 40 1,326 ( 1,066 ) 260 1,306 ( 1,032 ) 274 Other identifiable intangibles (a) 10 – 24 810 ( 326 ) 484 959 ( 288 ) 671 Total $ 3,088 $ ( 1,655 ) $ 1,433 $ 3,209 $ ( 1,565 ) $ 1,644 Amortization expense $ 81 $ 69 $ 68 (a) The change from 2018 to 2019 primarily reflects revisions to the purchase price allocation for our acquisition of SodaStream. Amortization of intangible assets for each of the next five years, based on existing intangible assets as of December 28, 2019 and using average 2019 foreign exchange rates, is expected to be as follows: 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 Five-year projected amortization $ 82 $ 80 $ 77 $ 75 $ 74 Depreciable and amortizable assets are evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. In these circumstances, if an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on discounted future cash flows. Useful lives are periodically evaluated to determine whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate the need for revision. Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets We did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in each of the years ended December 28, 2019 , December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 . We did not recognize any material impairment charges for indefinite-lived intangible assets in each of the years ended December 28, 2019 , December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 . As of December 28, 2019 , the estimated fair values of our indefinite-lived reacquired and acquired franchise rights recorded at PBNA exceeded their carrying values. However, there could be an 90 Table of Contents impairment of the carrying value of PBNA’s reacquired and acquired franchise rights if future revenues and their contribution to the operating results of PBNA’s CSD business do not achieve our expected future cash flows or if macroeconomic conditions result in a future increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value. We have also analyzed the impact of the macroeconomic conditions in Russia and Brazil on the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in these countries and have concluded that there were no impairments for the year ended December 28, 2019 . However, there could be an impairment of the carrying value of certain brands in these countries, including juice and dairy brands in Russia, if there is a deterioration in these conditions, if future revenues and their contributions to the operating results do not achieve our expected future cash flows (including perpetuity growth assumptions), if there are significant changes in the decisions regarding assets that do not perform consistent with our expectations, or if macroeconomic conditions result in a future increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value.

Among its many provisions, the TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings and reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35 % to 21 % , effective January 1, 2018. In 2017, the SEC issued guidance related to the TCJ Act which allowed recording of provisional tax expense using a measurement period, not to exceed one year, when information necessary to complete the accounting for the effects of the TCJ Act is not available. We elected to apply the measurement period provisions of this guidance to certain income tax effects of the TCJ Act when it became effective in the fourth quarter of 2017. As a result of the enactment of the TCJ Act, we recognized a provisional net tax expense of $ 2.5 billion ( $ 1.70 per share) in the fourth quarter of 2017. Included in the provisional net tax expense of $ 2.5 billion recognized in 2017, was a provisional mandatory one-time transition tax of approximately $ 4 billion on undistributed international earnings, included in other liabilities. This provisional mandatory one-time transition tax was partially offset by a provisional $ 1.5 billion benefit resulting from the required 93 Table of Contents remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the new, lower U.S. corporate income tax rate , effective January 1, 2018. The effect of the remeasurement was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, consistent with the enactment date of the TCJ Act, and reflected in our provision for income taxes. The provisional measurement period allowed by the SEC ended in the fourth quarter of 2018. As a result, in 2018, we recognized a net tax benefit of $ 28 million ( $ 0.02 per share) related to the TCJ Act, primarily reflecting the impact of the final analysis of certain foreign exchange gains or losses, substantiation of foreign tax credits, as well as cash and cash equivalents as of November 30, 2018, the tax year-end of our foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by additional transition tax guidance issued by the United States Department of Treasury, as well as the TCJ Act impact of both the conclusion of certain international tax audits and the resolution with the IRS of all open matters related to the audits of taxable years 2012 and 2013, each discussed below. While our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act was deemed to be complete, additional guidance issued by the IRS impacted, and may continue to impact, our recorded amounts after December 29, 2018. In 2019, we recognized a net tax benefit totaling $ 8 million ( $ 0.01 per share) related to the TCJ Act, including the impact of additional guidance issued by the IRS in the first quarter of 2019 and adjustments related to the filing of our 2018 U.S. federal tax return. As of December 28, 2019 , our mandatory transition tax liability was $ 3.3 billion , which must be paid through 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act. We reduced our liability through cash payments and application of tax overpayments by $ 663 million in 2019 and $ 150 million in 2018. We currently expect to pay approximately $ 0.1 billion of this liability in 2020 . The TCJ Act also created a requirement that certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries, known as global intangible low-tax income (GILTI), must be included in the gross income of their U.S. shareholder. The FASB allows an accounting policy election of either recognizing deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or recognizing such taxes as a current-period expense when incurred. During the first quarter of 2018, we elected to treat the tax effect of GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred. Other Tax Matters On May 19, 2019, a public referendum held in Switzerland passed the TRAF , effective January 1, 2020. The enactment of certain provisions of the TRAF in 2019 resulted in adjustments to our deferred taxes. During 2019 , we recorded net tax expense of $ 24 million related to the impact of the TRAF. Enactment of the TRAF provisions subsequent to December 28, 2019 is expected to result in adjustments to our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in future periods. The future impact of the TRAF cannot currently be reasonably estimated; we will continue to monitor and assess the impact the TRAF may have on our business and financial results. In 2018, we reorganized certain of our international operations, including the intercompany transfer of certain intangible assets. As a result, we recognized other net tax benefits of $ 4.3 billion ( $ 3.05 per share) in 2018. The related deferred tax asset of $ 4.4 billion is being amortized over a period of 15 years beginning in 2019. Additionally, the reorganization generated significant net operating loss carryforwards and related deferred tax assets that are not expected to be realized, resulting in the recording of a full valuation allowance. 94 Table of Contents Deferred tax liabilities and assets are comprised of the following: 2019 2018 Deferred tax liabilities Debt guarantee of wholly-owned subsidiary $ 578 $ 578 Property, plant and equipment 1,583 1,303 Recapture of net operating losses 335 414 Right-of-use assets 345 — Other 167 71 Gross deferred tax liabilities 3,008 2,366 Deferred tax assets Net carryforwards 4,168 4,353 Intangible assets other than nondeductible goodwill 793 985 Share-based compensation 94 106 Retiree medical benefits 154 167 Other employee-related benefits 350 303 Pension benefits 104 221 Deductible state tax and interest benefits 126 110 Lease liabilities 345 — Other 741 739 Gross deferred tax assets 6,875 6,984 Valuation allowances ( 3,599 ) ( 3,753 ) Deferred tax assets, net 3,276 3,231 Net deferred tax assets $ ( 268 ) $ ( 865 ) A summary of our valuation allowance activity is as follows: 2019 2018 2017 Balance, beginning of year $ 3,753 $ 1,163 $ 1,110 Provision ( 124 ) 2,639 33 Other (deductions)/additions ( 30 ) ( 49 ) 20 Balance, end of year $ 3,599 $ 3,753 $ 1,163 Reserves A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. Our major taxing jurisdictions and the related open tax audits are as follows: Jurisdiction Years Open to Audit Years Currently Under Audit United States 2014-2018 2014-2016 Mexico 2017-2018 None United Kingdom 2017-2018 2017 Canada (Domestic) 2015-2018 2015-2016 Canada (International) 2010-2018 2010-2016 Russia 2016-2018 None In 2018, we recognized a non-cash tax benefit of $ 364 million ( $ 0.26 per share) resulting from the conclusion of certain international tax audits. Additionally, in 2018, we recognized non-cash tax benefits of $ 353 million ( $ 0.24 per share) as a result of our agreement with the IRS resolving all open matters related to the audits 95 Table of Contents of taxable years 2012 and 2013, including the associated state impact. The conclusion of certain international tax audits and the resolution with the IRS, collectively, resulted in non-cash tax benefits totaling $ 717 million ( $ 0.50 per share) in 2018. Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning strategies and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we likely will not succeed. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit, new tax laws or tax authority settlements. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate in the year of resolution. As of December 28, 2019 , the total gross amount of reserves for income taxes, reported in other liabilities, was $ 1.4 billion . We accrue interest related to reserves for income taxes in our provision for income taxes and any associated penalties are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. The gross amount of interest accrued, reported in other liabilities, was $ 250 million as of December 28, 2019 , of which $ 84 million of tax expense was recognized in 2019 . The gross amount of interest accrued, reported in other liabilities, was $ 179 million as of December 29, 2018 , of which $ 64 million of tax benefit was recognized in 2018 . A reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: 2019 2018 Balance, beginning of year $ 1,440 $ 2,212 Additions for tax positions related to the current year 179 142 Additions for tax positions from prior years 93 197 Reductions for tax positions from prior years ( 201 ) ( 822 ) Settlement payments ( 74 ) ( 233 ) Statutes of limitations expiration ( 47 ) ( 42 ) Translation and other 5 ( 14 ) Balance, end of year $ 1,395 $ 1,440 Carryforwards and Allowances Operating loss carryforwards totaling $ 24.7 billion at year-end 2019 are being carried forward in a number of foreign and state jurisdictions where we are permitted to use tax operating losses from prior periods to reduce future taxable income. These operating losses will expire as follows: $ 0.2 billion in 2020 , $ 20.3 billion between 2021 and 2039 and $ 4.2 billion may be carried forward indefinitely. We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Undistributed International Earnings In 2018, we repatriated $ 20.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments held in our foreign subsidiaries without such funds being subject to further U.S. federal income tax liability, related to the TCJ Act. As of December 28, 2019 , we had approximately $ 6 billion of undistributed international earnings. We intend to continue to reinvest $ 6 billion of earnings outside the United States for the foreseeable future and while future distribution of these earnings would not be subject to U.S. federal tax expense, no deferred tax liabilities with respect to items such as certain foreign exchange gains or losses, foreign withholding taxes or state taxes have been recognized. It is not practicable for us to determine the amount of unrecognized tax expense on these reinvested international earnings. 96 Table of Contents Note 6 — Share-Based Compensation Our share-based compensation program is designed to attract and retain employees while also aligning employees’ interests with the interests of our shareholders. PepsiCo has granted stock options, RSUs, PSUs, PEPunits and long-term cash awards to employees under the shareholder-approved PepsiCo, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). Executives who are awarded long-term incentives based on their performance may generally elect to receive their grant in the form of stock options or RSUs, or a combination thereof. Executives who elect stock options receive four stock options for every one RSU that would have otherwise been granted. Certain executive officers and other senior executives do not have a choice and are granted 66 % PSUs and 34 % long-term cash, each of which are subject to pre-established performance targets. The Company may use authorized and unissued shares to meet share requirements resulting from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of RSUs, PSUs and PEPunits. As of December 28, 2019 , 59 million shares were available for future share-based compensation grants under the LTIP. The following table summarizes our total share-based compensation expense and excess tax benefits recognized: 2019 2018 2017 Share-based compensation expense - equity awards $ 237 $ 256 $ 292 Share-based compensation expense - liability awards 8 20 13 Restructuring charges ( 2 ) ( 6 ) ( 2 ) Total (a) $ 243 $ 270 $ 303 Income tax benefits recognized in earnings related to share-based compensation $ 39 $ 45 $ 89 (b) Excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation $ 50 $ 48 $ 115 (a) Primarily recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. (b) Reflects tax rates effective for the 2017 tax year. As of December 28, 2019 , there was $ 284 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation grants. This unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of two years . Method of Accounting and Our Assumptions The fair value of share-based award grants is amortized to expense over the vesting period, primarily three years . Awards to employees eligible for retirement prior to the award becoming fully vested are amortized to expense over the period through the date that the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide service to earn the award. In addition, we use historical data to estimate forfeiture rates and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. We do not backdate, reprice or grant share-based compensation awards retroactively. Repricing of awards would require shareholder approval under the LTIP. Stock Options A stock option permits the holder to purchase shares of PepsiCo common stock at a specified price. We account for our employee stock options under the fair value method of accounting using a Black-Scholes valuation model to measure stock option expense at the date of grant. All stock option grants have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and generally have a 10 -year term. 97 Table of Contents Our weighted-average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions are as follows: 2019 2018 2017 Expected life 5 years 5 years 5 years Risk-free interest rate 2.4 % 2.6 % 2.0 % Expected volatility 14 % 12 % 11 % Expected dividend yield 3.1 % 2.7 % 2.7 % The expected life is the period over which our employee groups are expected to hold their options. It is based on our historical experience with similar grants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the expected U.S. Treasury rate over the expected life. Volatility reflects movements in our stock price over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life. Dividend yield is estimated over the expected life based on our stated dividend policy and forecasts of net income, share repurchases and stock price. A summary of our stock option activity for the year ended December 28, 2019 is as follows: Options (a) Weighted-Average Exercise Price Weighted-Average Contractual Life Remaining (years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (b) Outstanding at December 29, 2018 15,589 $ 79.94 Granted 1,286 $ 118.33 Exercised ( 4,882 ) $ 67.34 Forfeited/expired ( 368 ) $ 94.30 Outstanding at December 28, 2019 11,625 $ 89.03 4.68 $ 563,942 Exercisable at December 28, 2019 7,972 $ 78.27 3.13 $ 472,512 Expected to vest as of December 28, 2019 3,364 $ 112.25 8.04 $ 85,066 (a) Options are in thousands and include options previously granted under the PBG plan. No additional options or shares were granted under the PBG plan after 2009. (b) In thousands. Restricted Stock Units and Performance Stock Units Each RSU represents our obligation to deliver to the holder one share of PepsiCo common stock when the award vests at the end of the service period. PSUs are awards pursuant to which a number of shares are delivered to the holder upon vesting at the end of the service period based on PepsiCo’s performance against specified financial and/or operational performance metrics. The number of shares may be increased to the maximum or reduced to the minimum threshold based on the results of these performance metrics in accordance with the terms established at the time of the award. During the vesting period, RSUs and PSUs accrue dividend equivalents that pay out in cash (without interest) if and when the applicable RSU or PSU vests and becomes payable. The fair value of RSUs and PSUs are measured at the market price of the Company’s stock on the date of grant. 98 Table of Contents A summary of our RSU and PSU activity for the year ended December 28, 2019 is as follows: RSUs/PSUs (a) Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value Weighted-Average Contractual Life Remaining (years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (a) Outstanding at December 29, 2018 7,175 $ 105.13 Granted (b) 2,754 $ 116.87 Converted ( 2,642 ) $ 99.35 Forfeited ( 852 ) $ 111.11 Actual performance change (c) ( 55 ) $ 108.32 Outstanding at December 28, 2019 (d) 6,380 $ 111.53 1.22 $ 877,487 Expected to vest as of December 28, 2019 5,876 $ 111.32 1.19 $ 808,220 (a) In thousands.

(d) The outstanding PSUs for which the performance period has not ended as of December 28, 2019 , at the threshold, target and maximum award levels were zero , 0.7 million and 1.3 million , respectively. PEPunits PEPunits provide an opportunity to earn shares of PepsiCo common stock with a value that adjusts based upon changes in PepsiCo’s absolute stock price as well as PepsiCo’s Total Shareholder Return relative to the S&P 500 over a three-year performance period. The fair value of PEPunits is measured using the Monte-Carlo simulation model, which incorporates into the fair-value determination the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied, until actual performance is determined. PEPunits were last granted in 2015 and all 248,000 units outstanding at December 30, 2017, with a weighted average grant date fair value of $ 68.94 , were converted to 278,000 shares in 2018. Long-Term Cash Certain executive officers and other senior executives were granted long-term cash awards for which final payout is based on PepsiCo’s Total Shareholder Return relative to a specific set of peer companies and achievement of a specified performance target over a three-year performance period. Long-term cash awards that qualify as liability awards under share-based compensation guidance are valued through the end of the performance period on a mark-to-market basis using the Monte Carlo simulation model. 99 Table of Contents A summary of our long-term cash activity for the year ended December 28, 2019 is as follows: Long-Term Cash Award (a) Balance Sheet Date Fair Value (a) Contractual Life Remaining (years) Outstanding at December 29, 2018 $ 54,710 Granted (b) 16,112 Vested ( 15,438 ) Forfeited ( 9,465 ) Actual performance change (c) ( 1,695 ) Outstanding at December 28, 2019 (d) $ 44,224 $ 45,875 1.10 Expected to Vest at December 28, 2019 $ 42,998 $ 44,557 1.10 (a) In thousands.

As of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 , there were approximately 269,000 and 248,000 outstanding awards, respectively, consisting primarily of phantom stock units that were granted under the PepsiCo Director Deferral Program and will be settled in shares of PepsiCo common stock pursuant to the LTIP at the end of the applicable deferral period, not included in the tables above. Note 7 — Pension, Retiree Medical and Savings Plans In 2019, Plan A purchased a group annuity contract whereby a third-party insurance company assumed the obligation to pay and administer future annuity payments for certain retirees. This transaction triggered a pre-tax settlement charge in 2019 of $ 220 million ( $ 170 million after-tax or $ 0.12 per share). 100 Table of Contents Also in 2019, certain former employees who had vested benefits in our U.S. defined benefit pension plans were offered the option of receiving a one-time lump sum payment equal to the present value of the participant’s pension benefit. This transaction triggered a pre-tax settlement charge in 2019 of $ 53 million ( $ 41 million after-tax or $ 0.03 per share). Collectively, the group annuity contract and one-time lump sum payments to certain former employees who had vested benefits resulted in settlement charges in 2019 of $ 273 million ( $ 211 million after-tax or $ 0.15 per share). Effective January 1, 2017, the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans were reorganized into Plan A and Plan I. Actuarial gains and losses associated with Plan A are amortized over the average remaining service life of the active participants, while the actuarial gains and losses associated with Plan I are amortized over the remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants. As a result of this change, the pre-tax net periodic benefit cost decreased by $ 42 million ($ 27 million after-tax, reflecting tax rates effective for the 2017 tax year, or $ 0.02 per share) in 2017, primarily impacting corporate unallocated expenses. Gains and losses resulting from actual experience differing from our assumptions, including the difference between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets, as well as changes in our assumptions, are determined at each measurement date. These differences are recognized as a component of net gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss. If this net accumulated gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or plan liabilities, a portion of the net gain or loss is included in other pension and retiree medical benefits (expense)/income for the following year based upon the average remaining service life for participants in Plan A (approximately 10 years ) and retiree medical (approximately 8 years ), or the remaining life expectancy for participants in Plan I (approximately 23 years ). The cost or benefit of plan changes that increase or decrease benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost/(credit)) is included in other pension and retiree medical benefits (expense)/income on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service life for participants in Plan A or the remaining life expectancy for participants in Plan I. 101 Table of Contents Selected financial information for our pension and retiree medical plans is as follows: Pension Retiree Medical U.S. International 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 Change in projected benefit liability Liability at beginning of year $ 13,807 $ 14,777 $ 3,098 $ 3,490 $ 996 $ 1,187 Service cost 381 431 73 92 23 32 Interest cost 543 482 97 93 36 34 Plan amendments 15 83 1 2 — — Participant contributions — — 2 2 — — Experience loss/(gain) 2,091 ( 972 ) 515 ( 230 ) 36 ( 147 ) Benefit payments ( 341 ) ( 956 ) ( 100 ) ( 114 ) ( 105 ) ( 108 ) Settlement/curtailment ( 1,268 ) ( 74 ) ( 31 ) ( 35 ) — — Special termination benefits 2 36 — 2 — 1 Other, including foreign currency adjustment — — 98 ( 204 ) 2 ( 3 ) Liability at end of year $ 15,230 $ 13,807 $ 3,753 $ 3,098 $ 988 $ 996 Change in fair value of plan assets Fair value at beginning of year $ 12,258 $ 12,582 $ 3,090 $ 3,460 $ 285 $ 321 Actual return on plan assets 3,101 ( 789 ) 551 ( 136 ) 78 ( 21 ) Employer contributions/funding 550 1,495 122 120 44 93 Participant contributions — — 2 2 — — Benefit payments ( 341 ) ( 956 ) ( 100 ) ( 114 ) ( 105 ) ( 108 ) Settlement ( 1,266 ) ( 74 ) ( 31 ) ( 32 ) — — Other, including foreign currency adjustment — — 98 ( 210 ) — — Fair value at end of year $ 14,302 $ 12,258 $ 3,732 $ 3,090 $ 302 $ 285 Funded status $ ( 928 ) $ ( 1,549 ) $ ( 21 ) $ ( 8 ) $ ( 686 ) $ ( 711 ) Amounts recognized Other assets $ 744 $ 185 $ 99 $ 81 $ — $ — Other current liabilities ( 52 ) ( 107 ) ( 1 ) ( 1 ) ( 58 ) ( 41 ) Other liabilities ( 1,620 ) ( 1,627 ) ( 119 ) ( 88 ) ( 628 ) ( 670 ) Net amount recognized $ ( 928 ) $ ( 1,549 ) $ ( 21 ) $ ( 8 ) $ ( 686 ) $ ( 711 ) Amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive loss (pre-tax) Net loss/(gain) $ 3,516 $ 4,093 $ 914 $ 780 $ ( 285 ) $ ( 287 ) Prior service cost/(credit) 114 109 — ( 1 ) ( 32 ) ( 51 ) Total $ 3,630 $ 4,202 $ 914 $ 779 $ ( 317 ) $ ( 338 ) Changes recognized in net (gain)/loss included in other comprehensive loss Net (gain)/loss arising in current year $ ( 120 ) $ 760 $ 152 $ 103 $ ( 24 ) $ ( 107 ) Amortization and settlement recognition ( 457 ) ( 187 ) ( 44 ) ( 56 ) 27 8 Foreign currency translation loss/(gain) — — 26 ( 49 ) ( 1 ) 1 Total $ ( 577 ) $ 573 $ 134 $ ( 2 ) $ 2 $ ( 98 ) Accumulated benefit obligation at end of year $ 14,255 $ 12,890 $ 3,441 $ 2,806 The net (gain)/loss arising in the current year is attributed to the change in discount rate, primarily offset by the actual asset returns different from expected returns. The amount we report in operating profit as pension and retiree medical cost is service cost, which is the 102 Table of Contents value of benefits earned by employees for working during the year. The amounts we report below operating profit as pension and retiree medical cost consist of the following components: • Interest cost is the accrued interest on the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time. • Expected return on plan assets is the long-term return we expect to earn on plan investments for our funded plans that will be used to settle future benefit obligations. • Amortization of prior service cost/(credit) represents the recognition in the income statement of benefit changes resulting from plan amendments. • Amortization of net loss/(gain) represents the recognition in the income statement of changes in the amount of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation based on changes in assumptions and actual experience. • Settlement/curtailment loss/(gain) represents the result of actions that effectively eliminate all or a portion of related projected benefit obligations. Settlements are triggered when payouts to settle the projected benefit obligation of a plan due to lump sums or other events exceed the annual service and interest cost. Settlements are recognized when actions are irrevocable and we are relieved of the primary responsibility and risk for projected benefit obligations. Curtailments are due to events such as plant closures or the sale of a business resulting in a reduction of future service or benefits. Curtailment losses are recognized when an event is probable and estimable, while curtailment gains are recognized when an event has occurred (when the related employees terminate or an amendment is adopted). • Special termination benefits are the additional benefits offered to employees upon departure due to actions such as restructuring. The components of total pension and retiree medical benefit costs are as follows: Pension Retiree Medical U.S. International 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 2017 Service cost $ 381 $ 431 $ 401 $ 73 $ 92 $ 91 $ 23 $ 32 $ 28 Other pension and retiree medical benefits expense/(income): Interest cost $ 543 $ 482 $ 468 $ 97 $ 93 $ 89 $ 36 $ 34 $ 36 Expected return on plan assets ( 892 ) ( 943 ) ( 849 ) ( 188 ) ( 197 ) ( 176 ) ( 18 ) ( 19 ) ( 22 ) Amortization of prior service cost/(credits) 10 3 1 — — — ( 19 ) ( 20 ) ( 25 ) Amortization of net losses/(gains) 161 179 123 32 45 53 ( 27 ) ( 8 ) ( 12 ) Settlement/curtailment losses (a) 296 8 8 12 6 11 — — — Special termination benefits 1 36 60 — 2 — — 1 2 Total other pension and retiree medical benefits expense/(income) $ 119 $ ( 235 ) $ ( 189 ) $ ( 47 ) $ ( 51 ) $ ( 23 ) $ ( 28 ) $ ( 12 ) $ ( 21 ) Total $ 500 $ 196 $ 212 $ 26 $ 41 $ 68 $ ( 5 ) $ 20 $ 7 (a) In 2019, U.S. includes settlement charges related to the purchase of a group annuity contract of $ 220 million and a pension lump sum settlement charge of $ 53 million . 103 Table of Contents The following table provides the weighted-average assumptions used to determine projected benefit liability and net periodic benefit cost for our pension and retiree medical plans: Pension Retiree Medical U.S. International 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 2017 Liability discount rate 3.3 % 4.4 % 3.7 % 2.5 % 3.4 % 3.0 % 3.1 % 4.2 % 3.5 % Service cost discount rate 4.4 % 3.8 % 4.5 % 4.2 % 3.5 % 3.6 % 4.3 % 3.6 % 4.0 % Interest cost discount rate 4.1 % 3.4 % 3.7 % 3.2 % 2.8 % 2.8 % 3.8 % 3.0 % 3.2 % Expected return on plan assets 7.1 % 7.2 % 7.5 % 5.8 % 6.0 % 6.0 % 6.6 % 6.5 % 7.5 % Liability rate of salary increases 3.1 % 3.1 % 3.1 % 3.3 % 3.7 % 3.7 % Expense rate of salary increases 3.1 % 3.1 % 3.1 % 3.7 % 3.7 % 3.6 % The following table provides selected information about plans with accumulated benefit obligation and total projected benefit liability in excess of plan assets: Pension Retiree Medical U.S. International 2019 2018 2019 2018 2019 2018 Selected information for plans with accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets Liability for service to date $ ( 9,194 ) $ ( 8,040 ) $ ( 192 ) $ ( 155 ) Fair value of plan assets $ 8,497 $ 7,223 $ 151 $ 121 Selected information for plans with projected benefit liability in excess of plan assets Benefit liability $ ( 10,169 ) $ ( 8,957 ) $ ( 632 ) $ ( 514 ) $ ( 988 ) $ ( 996 ) Fair value of plan assets $ 8,497 $ 7,223 $ 512 $ 426 $ 302 $ 285 Of the total projected pension benefit liability as of December 28, 2019 , approximately $ 847 million relates to plans that we do not fund because the funding of such plans does not receive favorable tax treatment. Future Benefit Payments Our estimated future benefit payments are as follows: 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 - 2029 Pension $ 945 $ 915 $ 900 $ 930 $ 970 $ 5,275 Retiree medical (a) $ 100 $ 95 $ 95 $ 90 $ 85 $ 355 (a) Expected future benefit payments for our retiree medical plans do not reflect any estimated subsidies expected to be received under the 2003 Medicare Act. Subsidies are expected to be approximately $ 2 million for each of the years from 2020 through 2024 and approximately $ 4 million in total for 2025 through 2029. These future benefit payments to beneficiaries include payments from both funded and unfunded plans. Funding Contributions to our pension and retiree medical plans were as follows: Pension Retiree Medical 2019 2018 2017 2019 2018 2017 Discretionary (a) $ 417 $ 1,417 $ 6 $ — $ 37 $ — Non-discretionary 255 198 158 44 56 56 Total $ 672 $ 1,615 $ 164 $ 44 $ 93 $ 56 (a) Includes $ 400 million contribution in 2019 and $ 1.4 billion contribution in 2018 to fund Plan A in the United States. 104 Table of Contents In January 2020 , we made discretionary contributions of $ 150 million to Plan A in the United States. In addition, in 2020 , we expect to make non-discretionary contributions of approximately $ 150 million to our U.S. and international pension benefit plans and approximately $ 60 million for retiree medical benefits. We regularly evaluate opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans. Plan Assets Our pension plan investment strategy includes the use of actively managed accounts and is reviewed periodically in conjunction with plan liabilities, an evaluation of market conditions, tolerance for risk and cash requirements for benefit payments. This strategy is also applicable to funds held for the retiree medical plans. Our investment objective includes ensuring that funds are available to meet the plans’ benefit obligations when they become due. Assets contributed to our pension plans are no longer controlled by us, but become the property of our individual pension plans. However, we are indirectly impacted by changes in these plan assets as compared to changes in our projected liabilities. Our overall investment policy is to prudently invest plan assets in a well-diversified portfolio of equity and high-quality debt securities and real estate to achieve our long-term return expectations. Our investment policy also permits the use of derivative instruments, such as futures and forward contracts, to reduce interest rate and foreign currency risks. Futures contracts represent commitments to purchase or sell securities at a future date and at a specified price. Forward contracts consist of currency forwards. For 2020 and 2019 , our expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets is 6.8 % and 7.1 % , respectively. Our target investment allocations for U.S. plan assets are as follows: 2020 2019 Fixed income 50 % 47 % U.S. equity 25 % 29 % International equity 21 % 20 % Real estate 4 % 4 % Actual investment allocations may vary from our target investment allocations due to prevailing market conditions. We regularly review our actual investment allocations and periodically rebalance our investments. The expected return on plan assets is based on our investment strategy and our expectations for long-term rates of return by asset class, taking into account volatility and correlation among asset classes and our historical experience. We also review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of the long-term rates. We evaluate our expected return assumptions annually to ensure that they are reasonable. To calculate the expected return on plan assets, our market-related value of assets for fixed income is the actual fair value. For all other asset categories, such as equity securities, we use a method that recognizes investment gains or losses (the difference between the expected and actual return based on the market-related value of assets) over a five-year period. This has the effect of reducing year-to-year volatility. 105 Table of Contents Plan assets measured at fair value as of year-end 2019 and 2018 are categorized consistently by level, and are as follows: 2019 2018 Total Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total U.S. plan assets (a) Equity securities, including preferred stock (b) $ 6,605 $ 6,605 $ — $ — $ 5,605 Government securities (c) 2,154 — 2,154 — 1,674 Corporate bonds (c) 4,737 — 4,737 — 4,145 Mortgage-backed securities (c) 159 — 159 — 212 Contracts with insurance companies (d) 9 — — 9 9 Cash and cash equivalents 275 275 — — 215 Sub-total U.S. plan assets 13,939 $ 6,880 $ 7,050 $ 9 11,860 Real estate commingled funds measured at net asset value (e) 605 618 Dividends and interest receivable, net of payables 60 65 Total U.S. plan assets $ 14,604 $ 12,543 International plan assets Equity securities (b) $ 1,973 $ 1,941 $ 32 $ — $ 1,651 Government securities (c) 524 — 524 — 433 Corporate bonds (c) 585 — 585 — 478 Fixed income commingled funds (f) 384 384 — — 356 Contracts with insurance companies (d) 42 — — 42 36 Cash and cash equivalents 24 24 — — 27 Sub-total international plan assets 3,532 $ 2,349 $ 1,141 $ 42 2,981 Real estate commingled funds measured at net asset value (e) 193 102 Dividends and interest receivable 7 7 Total international plan assets $ 3,732 $ 3,090 (a) 2019 and 2018 amounts include $ 302 million and $ 285 million , respectively, of retiree medical plan assets that are restricted for purposes of providing health benefits for U.S. retirees and their beneficiaries. (b) The equity securities portfolio was invested in U.S. and international common stock and commingled funds, and the preferred stock portfolio in the U.S. was invested in domestic and international corporate preferred stock investments. The common stock is based on quoted prices in active markets. The commingled funds are based on the published price of the fund and the U.S. commingled funds include one large-cap fund that represents 16 % and 15 % of total U.S. plan assets for 2019 and 2018 , respectively. The preferred stock investments are based on quoted bid prices for comparable securities in the marketplace and broker/dealer quotes in active markets. (c) These investments are based on quoted bid prices for comparable securities in the marketplace and broker/dealer quotes in active markets. Corporate bonds of U.S.-based companies represent 28 % of total U.S. plan assets for both 2019 and 2018 . (d) Based on the fair value of the contracts as determined by the insurance companies using inputs that are not observable. The changes in Level 3 amounts were not significant in the years ended December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 . (e) The real estate commingled funds include investments in limited partnerships. These funds are based on the net asset value of the appraised value of investments owned by these funds as determined by independent third parties using inputs that are not observable. The majority of the funds are redeemable quarterly subject to availability of cash and have notice periods ranging from 45 to 90 days. (f) Base d on the published price of the fund. Retiree Medical Cost Trend Rates 2020 2019 Average increase assumed 6 % 6 % Ultimate projected increase 5 % 5 % Year of ultimate projected increase 2039 2039 106 Table of Contents These assumed health care cost trend rates have an impact on the retiree medical plan expense and liability, however the cap on our share of retiree medical costs limits the impact. Savings Plan Certain U.S. employees are eligible to participate in a 401(k) savings plan, which is a voluntary defined contribution plan. The plan is designed to help employees accumulate savings for retirement, and we make Company matching contributions for certain employees on a portion of eligible pay based on years of service. Certain U.S. salaried employees, who are not eligible to participate in a defined benefit pension plan, are also eligible to receive an employer contribution to the 401(k) savings plan based on age and years of service regardless of employee contribution. In 2019 , 2018 and 2017 , our total Company contributions were $ 197 million , $ 180 million and $ 176 million , respectively.

(b) The interest rates presented reflect weighted-average effective interest rates at year-end. Certain of our fixed rate indebtedness have been swapped to floating rates through the use of interest rate derivative instruments. See Note 9 for further information regarding our interest rate derivative instruments. As of December 28, 2019 , our international debt of $ 69 million was related to borrowings from external parties including various lines of credit. These lines of credit are subject to normal banking terms and conditions and are fully committed at least to the extent of our borrowings. 107 Table of Contents In 2019 , we issued the following senior notes: Interest Rate Maturity Date Amount (a) 0.750 % March 2027 € 500 (b) 1.125 % March 2031 € 500 (b) 2.625 % July 2029 $ 1,000 3.375 % July 2049 $ 1,000 0.875 % October 2039 € 500 (b) 2.875 % October 2049 $ 1,000 (a) Represents gross proceeds from issuances of long-term debt excluding debt issuance costs, discounts and premiums. (b) These notes, issued in euros, were designated as net investment hedges to partially offset the effects of foreign currency on our investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries. The net proceeds from the issuances of the above notes were used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of commercial paper, except for an amount equivalent to the net proceeds from our 2.875 % senior notes due 2049 that will be used to fund, in whole or in part, eligible green projects in the categories of investments in sustainable plastics and packaging, decarbonizing our operations and supply chain and water sustainability, which promote our selected Sustainable Development Goals, as defined by the United Nations. In 2019, we entered into a new five-year unsecured revolving credit agreement (Five-Year Credit Agreement) which expires on June 3, 2024. The Five-Year Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $ 3.75 billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros, including a $ 0.75 billion swing line subfacility for euro-denominated borrowings permitted to be borrowed on a same-day basis, subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $ 4.5 billion (or the equivalent amount in euros). Additionally, we may, once a year, request renewal of the agreement for an additional one-year period. In 2019, we entered into a new 364-day unsecured revolving credit agreement (364-Day Credit Agreement) which expires on June 1, 2020. The 364-Day Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $ 3.75 billion in U.S. dollars and/or euros, subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $ 4.5 billion (or the equivalent amount in euros). We may request renewal of this facility for an additional 364-day period or convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year, which would mature no later than the anniversary of the then effective termination date. The Five-Year Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Credit Agreement together replaced our $ 3.75 billion five-year credit agreement and our $ 3.75 billion 364-day credit agreement, both dated as of June 4, 2018. Funds borrowed under the Five-Year Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. Subject to certain conditions, we may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts under these agreements. As of December 28, 2019 , there were no outstanding borrowings under the Five-Year Credit Agreement or the 364-Day Credit Agreement. In 2019, we entered into two unsecured bridge loan facilities (Bridge Loan Facilities) which together enable one of our consolidated subsidiaries to borrow up to 25.0 billion South African rand, or approximately $ 1.8 billion , to provide potential funding for our acquisition of Pioneer Foods. Each facility is available from the date the conditions precedent are met for the acquisition up through July 30, 2020 in the case of one facility and July 31, 2020 in the case of the other facility. Borrowings under the facilities are for up to one year once drawn and can be prepaid at any time. Interest rates are reset either every one month or three months. As of December 28, 2019, there were no outstanding borrowings under the Bridge Loan Facilities. In 2019, we paid $ 1.0 billion to redeem all $ 1.0 billion outstanding principal amount of our 4.50 % senior notes due 2020. 108 Table of Contents In 2018, we completed a cash tender offer for certain notes issued by PepsiCo and predecessors to a PepsiCo subsidiary for $ 1.6 billion in cash to redeem the following amounts: Interest Rate Maturity Date Amount Tendered 7.290 % September 2026 $ 11 7.440 % September 2026 $ 4 7.000 % March 2029 $ 357 5.500 % May 2035 $ 138 4.875 % November 2040 $ 410 5.500 % January 2040 $ 408 Also in 2018, we completed an exchange offer for certain notes issued by predecessors to a PepsiCo subsidiary for the following newly issued PepsiCo notes. These notes were issued in an aggregate principal amount equal to the exchanged notes: Interest Rate Maturity Date Amount Exchanged 7.290 % September 2026 $ 88 7.440 % September 2026 $ 21 7.000 % March 2029 $ 516 5.500 % May 2035 $ 107 As a result of the above transactions, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $ 253 million ( $ 191 million after-tax or $ 0.13 per share) to interest expense in 2018, primarily representing the tender price paid over the carrying value of the tendered notes. Note 9 — Financial Instruments Derivatives and Hedging We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in: • commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy; • foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and • interest rates. In the normal course of business, we manage commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of strategies, including productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs and hedging. Ongoing productivity initiatives involve the identification and effective implementation of meaningful cost-saving opportunities or efficiencies, including the use of derivatives. Our global purchasing programs include fixed-price contracts and purchase orders and pricing agreements. Our hedging strategies include the use of derivatives and, in the case of our net investment hedges, debt instruments. Certain derivatives are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment, while others do not qualify and are marked to market through earnings. The accounting for qualifying hedges allows changes in a hedging instrument’s fair value to offset corresponding changes in the hedged item in the same reporting period that the hedged item impacts earnings. Gains or losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss and reclassified to our income statement when the hedged transaction affects earnings. If it becomes probable that the hedged transaction will not occur, we immediately recognize the related hedging gains or losses in earnings; such gains or losses reclassified during the year ended December 28, 2019 were not material. 109 Table of Contents Cash flows from derivatives used to manage commodity price, foreign exchange or interest rate risks are classified as operating activities in the cash flow statement. We classify both the earnings and cash flow impact from these derivatives consistent with the underlying hedged item. We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We perform assessments of our counterparty credit risk regularly, including reviewing netting agreements, if any, and a review of credit ratings, credit default swap rates and potential nonperformance of the counterparty. Based on our most recent assessment of our counterparty credit risk, we consider this risk to be low. In addition, we enter into derivative contracts with a variety of financial institutions that we believe are creditworthy in order to reduce our concentration of credit risk. Certain of our agreements with our counterparties require us to post full collateral on derivative instruments in a net liability position if our credit rating is at A2 (Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.) or A (S&P Global Ratings) and we have been placed on credit watch for possible downgrade or if our credit rating falls below these levels. The fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk-related contingent features that were in a net liability position on December 28, 2019 was $ 415 million . We have posted no collateral under these contracts and no credit-risk-related contingent features were triggered as of December 28, 2019. Commodity Prices We are subject to commodity price risk because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited in the competitive environment in which we operate. This risk is managed through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, which primarily include swaps and futures. In addition, risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. We use derivatives, with terms of no more than three years , to hedge price fluctuations related to a portion of our anticipated commodity purchases, primarily for energy, agricultural products and metals . Derivatives used to hedge commodity price risk that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Our commodity derivatives had a total notional value of $ 1.1 billion as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 . Foreign Exchange We are exposed to foreign exchange risks in the international markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. Additionally, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency purchases and foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. We manage this risk through sourcing purchases from local suppliers, negotiating contracts in local currencies with foreign suppliers and through the use of derivatives, primarily forward contracts with terms of no more than two years . Exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions are recognized as transaction gains or losses on our income statement as incurred. We also use net investment hedges to partially offset the effects of foreign currency on our investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries. Our foreign currency derivatives had a total notional value of $ 1.9 billion as of December 28, 2019 and $ 2.0 billion as of December 29, 2018 . The total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was $ 2.5 billion as of December 28, 2019 and $ 0.9 billion as of December 29, 2018 . For foreign currency derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, gains and losses were offset by changes in the underlying hedged items, resulting in no material net impact on earnings. 110 Table of Contents Interest Rates We centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks, tax consequences and overall financing strategies. We use various interest rate derivative instruments including, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps, Treasury locks and swap locks to manage our overall interest expense and foreign exchange risk. These instruments effectively change the interest rate and currency of specific debt issuances. Certain of our fixed rate indebtedness have been swapped to floating rates. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt. Our cross-currency interest rate swaps have terms of no more than twelve years . Our Treasury locks and swap locks are entered into to protect against unfavorable interest rate changes relating to forecasted debt transactions. Our interest rate derivatives had a total notional value of $ 5.0 billion as of December 28, 2019 and $ 10.5 billion as of December 29, 2018 . As of December 28, 2019 , approximately 9 % of total debt, after the impact of the related interest rate derivative instruments, was subject to variable rates, compared to approximately 29 % as of December 29, 2018 . Available-for-Sale Securities Investments in debt securities are classified as available-for-sale. All highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents. Our investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of available-for-sale debt securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders’ equity. Unrealized gains and losses on our investments in debt securities as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 were not material. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale debt securities impact net income only when such securities are sold or an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized. We recorded no other-than-temporary impairment charges on our available-for-sale debt securities for the years ended December 28, 2019 , December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 . In 2017, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $ 95 million ( $ 85 million after-tax or $ 0.06 per share), net of discount and fees, associated with the sale of our minority stake in Britvic. The gain on the sale of this equity investment was recorded in our Europe segment in selling, general and administrative expenses. 111 Table of Contents Fair Value Measurements The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 are categorized as follows: 2019 2018 Fair Value Hierarchy Levels (a) Assets (a) Liabilities (a) Assets (a) Liabilities (a) Available-for-sale debt securities (b) 2 $ — $ — $ 3,658 $ — Short-term investments (c) 1 $ 229 $ — $ 196 $ — Prepaid forward contracts (d) 2 $ 17 $ — $ 22 $ — Deferred compensation (e) 2 $ — $ 468 $ — $ 450 Derivatives designated as fair value hedging instruments: Interest rate (f) 2 $ — $ 5 $ 1 $ 108 Derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments: Foreign exchange (g) 2 $ 5 $ 32 $ 44 $ 14 Interest rate (g) 2 — 390 — 323 Commodity (h) 1 2 5 — 1 Commodity (i) 2 2 5 — 3 $ 9 $ 432 $ 44 $ 341 Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Foreign exchange (g) 2 $ 3 $ 2 $ 3 $ 10 Commodity (h) 1 23 7 2 17 Commodity (i) 2 6 24 5 92 $ 32 $ 33 $ 10 $ 119 Total derivatives at fair value (j) $ 41 $ 470 $ 55 $ 568 Total $ 287 $ 938 $ 3,931 $ 1,018 (a) Fair value hierarchy levels are defined in Note 7.

Collateral received or posted against our asset or liability positions is classified as restricted cash. See Note 15 for further information. The carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments approximate fair value due to their short-term maturity. The fair value of our debt obligations as of December 28, 2019 and 112 Table of Contents December 29, 2018 was $ 34 billion and $ 32 billion , respectively, based upon prices of similar instruments in the marketplace, which are considered Level 2 inputs.

We have operating leases for plants, warehouses, distribution centers, storage facilities, offices and other facilities, as well as machinery and equipment, including fleet. Our leases generally have remaining lease terms of up to 20 years , some of which include options to extend the lease term for up to five years , and some of which include options to terminate the lease within one year . We consider these options in determining the lease term used to establish our right-of-use 116 Table of Contents assets and lease liabilities. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. We have lease agreements that contain both lease and non-lease components. For real estate leases, we account for lease components together with non-lease components (e.g., common-area maintenance). Components of lease cost are as follows: 2019 Operating lease cost (a) $ 474 Variable lease cost (b) $ 101 Short-term lease cost (c) $ 379 (a) Includes right-of-use asset amortization of $ 412 million . (b) Primarily related to adjustments for inflation, common-area maintenance and property tax. (c) Not recorded on our balance sheet. In 2019, we recognized gains of $ 77 million on sale-leaseback transactions with terms under four years. Supplemental cash flow information and non-cash activity related to our operating leases are as follows: 2019 Operating cash flow information: Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities $ 478 Non-cash activity: Right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for lease obligations $ 479 Supplemental balance sheet information related to our operating leases is as follows: Balance Sheet Classification 2019 Right-of-use assets Other assets $ 1,548 Current lease liabilities Accounts payable and other current liabilities $ 442 Non-current lease liabilities Other liabilities $ 1,118 Weighted-average remaining lease term and discount rate for our operating leases are as follows: 2019 Weighted-average remaining lease term 6 years Weighted-average discount rate 4 % Maturities of lease liabilities by year for our operating leases are as follows: 2020 $ 501 2021 374 2022 280 2023 183 2024 117 2025 and beyond 308 Total lease payments 1,763 Less: Imputed interest ( 203 ) Present value of lease liabilities $ 1,560 117 Table of Contents As of December 29, 2018, minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases by period were expected to be as follows: 2019 $ 459 2020 406 2021 294 2022 210 2023 161 2024 and beyond 310 Total $ 1,840 A summary of rent expense for the years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 is as follows: 2018 2017 Rent expense $ 771 $ 742 Lessor We have various arrangements for certain foodservice and vending equipment under which we are the lessor. These leases meet the criteria for operating lease classification. Lease income associated with these leases is not material. Note 14 — Acquisitions and Divestitures Acquisition of Pioneer Food Group Ltd. On July 19, 2019, we entered into an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding shares of Pioneer Foods, a food and beverage company in South Africa with exports to countries across the globe , for 110.00 South African rand per share in cash, in a transaction valued at approximately $ 1.7 billion . Also in 2019, one of our consolidated subsidiaries entered into Bridge Loan Facilities to provide potential funding for our acquisition of Pioneer Foods. See Note 8 for further information. The transaction is subject to certain regulatory approvals and other customary conditions and is expected to be recorded primarily in the AMESA segment. Closing is expected in the first half of 2020. Acquisition of SodaStream International Ltd. On December 5, 2018, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of SodaStream, a manufacturer and distributor of sparkling water makers, for $ 144.00 per share in cash, in a transaction valued at approximately $ 3.3 billion . The total consideration transferred was approximately $ 3.3 billion (or $ 3.2 billion , net of cash and cash equivalents acquired). We accounted for the transaction as a business combination. We recognized and measured the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. The purchase price allocation was finalized in the fourth quarter of 2019. 118 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the acquisition of SodaStream and the resulting goodwill as of the acquisition date, all of which are recorded in the Europe segment. Inventories $ 176 Property, plant and equipment 193 Amortizable intangible assets 284 Nonamortizable intangible asset (brand) 1,840 Other assets and liabilities 210 Net deferred income taxes ( 303 ) Total identifiable net assets $ 2,400 Goodwill 943 Total purchase price $ 3,343 Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets recognized. The goodwill recorded as part of the acquisition of SodaStream primarily reflects the value of expected synergies from our product portfolios and is not deductible for tax purposes. Refranchising in Thailand In 2018, we refranchised our beverage business in Thailand by selling a controlling interest in our Thailand bottling operations to form a joint venture, where we now have an equity method investment. We recorded a pre-tax gain of $ 144 million ( $ 126 million after-tax or $ 0.09 per share) in selling, general and administrative expenses in our APAC segment as a result of this transaction. Refranchising in Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia In 2018, we refranchised our entire beverage bottling operations and snack distribution operations in CHS. We recorded a pre-tax gain of $ 58 million ( $ 46 million after-tax or $ 0.03 per share) in selling, general and administrative expenses in our Europe segment as a result of this transaction. Refranchising in Jordan In 2017, we refranchised our beverage business in Jordan by selling a controlling interest in our Jordan bottling operations to form a joint venture, where we now have an equity method investment. We recorded a pre-tax gain of $ 140 million ( $ 107 million after-tax or $ 0.07 per share) in selling, general and administrative expenses in our AMESA segment as a result of this transaction. Inventory Fair Value Adjustments and Merger and Integration Charges In 2019, we recorded inventory fair value adjustments and merger and integration charges of $ 55 million ( $ 47 million after-tax or $ 0.03 per share), including $ 46 million in our Europe segment, $ 7 million in our AMESA segment and $ 2 million in corporate unallocated expenses.

We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2019 , based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 28, 2019 and December 29, 2018 , and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 28, 2019 , in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 28, 2019 , based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Basis for Opinions The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. 123 Table of Contents Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Critical Audit Matters The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate. Evaluation of certain sales incentive accruals As discussed in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company offers sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. A number of the sales incentives are based on annual targets, resulting in the need to accrue for the expected liability. These incentives are accrued for in the “Accounts payable and other current liabilities” line on the balance sheet. These accruals are based on sales incentive agreements, expectations regarding customer and consumer participation and performance levels, and historical experience and trends. We identified the evaluation of certain of the Company’s sales incentive accruals as a critical audit matter. Subjective and complex auditor judgment is required in evaluating these sales incentive accruals as a result of the timing difference between when the product is delivered and when the incentive is settled. This specifically related to (1) forecasted customer and consumer participation and performance level assumptions underlying the accrual, and (2) the impact of historical experience and trends. The primary procedures that we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company’s sales incentive process, including (1) the accrual methodology, (2) assumptions around forecasted customer and consumer participation, (3) performance levels, and (4) monitoring of actual sales incentives incurred compared to estimated sales incentives in respect of historical periods. To evaluate the timing and amount of certain accrued sales incentives we (1) analyzed the accrual by sales incentive type as compared to historical trends to identify specific sales incentives that may require additional testing, (2) recalculated expenses and closing accruals on a sample basis, based on volumes sold and terms of the sales incentives, (3) assessed the Company’s ability to accurately estimate its sales incentive accrual by comparing previously established accruals 124 Table of Contents to actual settlements, and (4) tested a sample of settlements or claims that occurred after period end, and compared them to the recorded sales incentive accrual. Assessment of the carrying value of certain reacquired and acquired franchise rights and certain juice and dairy brands As discussed in Notes 2 and 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company performs impairment testing of its indefinite-lived intangible assets on an annual basis during the third quarter of each fiscal year and whenever events and changes in circumstances indicate that there is a greater than 50% likelihood that the asset is impaired. The carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets as of December 28, 2019 was $30.1 billion which represents 38% of total assets, and includes PepsiCo Beverages North America’s (PBNA) reacquired and acquired franchise rights which had a carrying value of $8.6 billion as of December 28, 2019. We identified the assessment of the carrying value of PBNA’s reacquired and acquired franchise rights and certain of Europe’s juice and dairy brands in Russia as a critical audit matter. Significant auditor judgment is necessary to assess the impact of competitive operating and macroeconomic factors on future levels of sales, operating profit and cash flows. The impairment analysis of these indefinite-lived intangible assets requires significant auditor judgment to evaluate the Company’s forecasted revenue and profitability levels, including the expected long-term growth rates and the selection of the discount rates to be applied to the projected cash flows. The primary procedures that we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company’s indefinite-lived assets impairment process to develop the forecasted revenue, profitability levels, and expected long-term growth rates and select the discount rates to be applied to the projected cash flows. We also evaluated the sensitivity of the Company’s conclusion to changes in assumptions, including the assessment of changes in assumptions from prior periods. To assess the Company’s ability to accurately forecast, we compared the Company’s historical forecasted results to actual results. We compared the cash flow projections used in the impairment tests with available external industry data and other internal information. We involved valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in evaluating (1) the long-term growth rates used in the impairment tests by comparing against economic data and information specific to the respective assets, including projected long-term nominal Gross Domestic Product growth in the respective local countries, and (2) the discount rates used in the impairment tests by comparing them against discount rates that were independently developed using publicly available market data, including that of comparable companies. Evaluation of unrecognized tax benefits As discussed in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s global operating model gives rise to income tax obligations in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions in which it operates. As of December 28, 2019, the Company recorded reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of $1.4 billion . The Company establishes reserves if it believes that certain positions taken in its tax returns are subject to challenge and the Company likely will not succeed, even though the Company believes the tax return position is supportable under the tax law. The Company adjusts these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of new information, such as the progress of a tax examination, or new tax law or tax authority settlements. We identified the evaluation of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits as a critical audit matter because the application of tax law and interpretation of a tax authority’s settlement history is complex and involves subjective judgment. Such judgments impact both the timing and amount of the reserves that are recognized, including judgments about re-measuring liabilities for positions taken in prior years’ tax returns in light of new information. 125 Table of Contents The primary procedures that we performed to address this critical audit matter included the following. We tested certain internal controls over the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits process, including controls to (1) identify uncertain income tax positions, (2) evaluate the tax law and tax authority’s settlement history used to estimate the unrecognized tax benefits, and (3) monitor for new information that may give rise to changes to the existing unrecognized tax benefits, such as progress of a tax examination, new tax law or tax authority settlements. We involved tax and valuation professionals with specialized skills and knowledge, who assisted in assessing the unrecognized tax benefits by (1) evaluating the Company’s tax structure and transactions, including transfer pricing arrangements, and (2) assessing the Company’s interpretation of existing tax law as well as new and amended tax laws, tax positions taken, and associated external counsel opinions. /s/ KPMG LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1990.

Form 10-K Summary 136 1 Table of Contents Forward-Looking Statements This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains statements reflecting our views about our future performance that constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (Reform Act). Statements that constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act are generally identified through the inclusion of words such as “aim,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “drive,” “estimate,” “expect,” “expressed confidence,” “forecast,” “future,” “goal,” “guidance,” “intend,” “may,” “objective,” “outlook,” “plan,” “position,” “potential,” “project,” “seek,” “should,” “strategy,” “target,” “will” or similar statements or variations of such words and other similar expressions. All statements addressing our future operating performance, and statements addressing events and developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Reform Act. These forward-looking statements are based on currently available information, operating plans and projections about future events and trends. They inherently involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those predicted in any such forward-looking statement. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Our Business – Our Business Risks.” Investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. The discussion of risks below and elsewhere in this report is by no means all-inclusive but is designed to highlight what we believe are important factors to consider when evaluating our future performance. PART I Item 1. Business. When used in this report, the terms “we,” “us,” “our,” “PepsiCo” and the “Company” mean PepsiCo, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, collectively. Certain terms used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K are defined in the Glossary included in Item 7. of this report. Company Overview We were incorporated in Delaware in 1919 and reincorporated in North Carolina in 1986. We are a leading global food and beverage company with a complementary portfolio of brands, including Frito-Lay, Gatorade, Pepsi-Cola, Quaker and Tropicana. Through our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a wide variety of convenient beverages, foods and snacks, serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories. Our Operations We are organized into six reportable segments (also referred to as divisions), as follows: 1) Frito-Lay North America (FLNA), which includes our branded food and snack businesses in the United States and Canada; 2) Quaker Foods North America (QFNA), which includes our cereal, rice, pasta and other branded food businesses in the United States and Canada; 3) North America Beverages (NAB), which includes our beverage businesses in the United States and Canada; 4) Latin America, which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Latin America; 5) Europe Sub-Saharan Africa (ESSA), which includes all of our beverage, food and snack businesses in Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa; and 6) Asia, Middle East and North Africa (AMENA), which includes all of our beverage, food and snack 2 Table of Contents businesses in Asia, Middle East and North Africa.

Further, we license the Tropicana brand for use in China on co-branded juice products in connection with a strategic alliance with Tingyi (Cayman Islands) Holding Corp. (Tingyi). Our Distribution Network Our products are primarily brought to market through direct-store-delivery (DSD), customer warehouse and distributor networks. The distribution system used depends on customer needs, product characteristics and local trade practices. Direct-Store-Delivery We, our independent bottlers and our distributors operate DSD systems that deliver beverages, foods and snacks directly to retail stores where the products are merchandised by our employees or our independent bottlers. DSD enables us to merchandise with maximum visibility and appeal. DSD is especially well-suited to products that are restocked often and respond to in-store promotion and merchandising. Customer Warehouse Some of our products are delivered from our manufacturing plants and warehouses to customer warehouses. These less costly systems generally work best for products that are less fragile and perishable, and have lower turnover. Distributor Networks We distribute many of our products through third-party distributors. Third-party distributors are particularly effective when greater distribution reach can be achieved by including a wide range of products on the delivery vehicles. For example, our foodservice and vending business distributes beverages, foods and snacks to restaurants, businesses, schools and stadiums through third-party foodservice and vending distributors and operators. Our products are also available on a growing number of e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications as consumer consumption patterns continue to change and retail increasingly expands online. Ingredients and Other Supplies The principal ingredients we use in our beverage, food and snack products are apple, orange and pineapple juice and other juice concentrates, aspartame, corn, corn sweeteners, flavorings, flour, grapefruit, oranges and other fruits, oats, potatoes, raw milk, rice, seasonings, sucralose, sugar, vegetable and essential oils, and 4 Table of Contents wheat. We also use water in the manufacturing of our products. Our key packaging materials include plastic resins, including polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polypropylene resins used for plastic beverage bottles and film packaging used for snack foods, aluminum used for cans, glass bottles, closures, cardboard and paperboard cartons. Fuel, electricity and natural gas are also important commodities for our businesses due to their use in our and our business partners’ facilities and the vehicles delivering our products. We employ specialists to secure adequate supplies of many of these items and have not experienced any significant continuous shortages that would prevent us from meeting our requirements. Many of these ingredients, raw materials and commodities are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and futures. In addition, risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. When prices increase, we may or may not pass on such increases to our customers. In addition, we continue to make investments to improve the sustainability and resources of our agricultural supply chain, including the development of our initiative to advance sustainable farming practices by our suppliers and expanding it globally. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on how we manage our exposure to commodity costs. Our Brands and Intellectual Property Rights We own numerous valuable trademarks which are essential to our worldwide businesses, including 1893, Agusha, Amp Energy, Aquafina, Aquafina Flavorsplash, Arto Lifewater, Aunt Jemima, Bare, bubly, Cap’n Crunch, Cheetos, Chester’s, Chipsy, Chokis, Chudo, Cracker Jack, Crunchy, Diet Mountain Dew, Diet Mug, Diet Pepsi, Diet Sierra Mist, Diet 7UP (outside the United States), Domik v Derevne, Doritos, Duyvis, Elma Chips, Emperador, Frito-Lay, Fritos, Fruktovy Sad, G2, Gamesa, Gatorade, Grandma’s, H2oh!, Health Warrior, Imunele, Izze, J-7 Tonus, Kas, KeVita, Kurkure, Lay’s, Life, Lifewtr, Lubimy, Manzanita Sol, Marias Gamesa, Matutano, Mirinda, Miss Vickie’s, Mother’s, Mountain Dew, Mountain Dew Code Red, Mountain Dew Ice, Mountain Dew Kickstart, Mug, Munchies, Naked, Near East, O.N.E., Paso de los Toros, Pasta Roni, Pepsi, Pepsi Black, Pepsi Max, Pepsi Next, Pepsi Zero Sugar, Propel, Quaker, Quaker Chewy, Rice-A-Roni, Rold Gold, Rosquinhas Mabel, Ruffles, Sabritas, Sakata, Saladitas, Sandora, Santitas, 7UP (outside the United States), 7UP Free (outside the United States), Sierra Mist, Simba, Smartfood, Smith’s, Snack a Jacks, SoBe, SodaStream, Sonric’s, Stacy’s, Sting, Stubborn Soda, SunChips, Toddy, Toddynho, Tostitos, Trop 50, Tropicana, Tropicana Farmstand, Tropicana Pure Premium, Tropicana Twister, V Water, Vesely Molochnik, Walkers and Ya. We also hold long-term licenses to use valuable trademarks in connection with our products in certain markets, including Dole and Ocean Spray. We also distribute Rockstar Energy drinks, Muscle Milk protein shakes and various Keurig Dr Pepper Inc. brands, including Dr Pepper in certain markets, Crush and Schweppes. Joint ventures in which we have an ownership interest either own or have the right to use certain trademarks, such as Lipton, Sabra and Starbucks. Trademarks remain valid so long as they are used properly for identification purposes, and we emphasize correct use of our trademarks. We have authorized, through licensing arrangements, the use of many of our trademarks in such contexts as snack food joint ventures and beverage bottling appointments. In addition, we license the use of our trademarks on merchandise that is sold at retail, which enhances brand awareness. We either own or have licenses to use a number of patents which relate to certain of our products, their packaging, the processes for their production and the design and operation of various equipment used in our businesses. Some of these patents are licensed to others. Seasonality Our businesses are affected by seasonal variations. For instance, our beverage sales are higher during the warmer months and certain food and dairy sales are higher in the cooler months. Weekly beverage and snack sales are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related patterns, and generally lowest in the first quarter. However, taken as a whole, seasonality has not had a material impact on our 5 Table of Contents consolidated financial results. Our Customers Our customers include wholesale and other distributors, foodservice customers, grocery stores, drug stores, convenience stores, discount/dollar stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, hard discounters, e-commerce retailers and authorized independent bottlers, among others. We normally grant our independent bottlers exclusive contracts to sell and manufacture certain beverage products bearing our trademarks within a specific geographic area. These arrangements provide us with the right to charge our independent bottlers for concentrate, finished goods and Aquafina royalties and specify the manufacturing process required for product quality. We also grant distribution rights to our independent bottlers for certain beverage products bearing our trademarks for specified geographic areas. We rely on and provide financial incentives to our customers to assist in the distribution and promotion of our products to the consumer. For our independent distributors and retailers, these incentives include volume-based rebates, product placement fees, promotions and displays. For our independent bottlers, these incentives are referred to as bottler funding and are negotiated annually with each bottler to support a variety of trade and consumer programs, such as consumer incentives, advertising support, new product support, and vending and cooler equipment placement. Consumer incentives include coupons, pricing discounts and promotions, and other promotional offers. Advertising support is directed at advertising programs and supporting independent bottler media. New product support includes targeted consumer and retailer incentives and direct marketplace support, such as point-of-purchase materials, product placement fees, media and advertising. Vending and cooler equipment placement programs support the acquisition and placement of vending machines and cooler equipment. The nature and type of programs vary annually. Changes to the retail landscape, including increased consolidation of retail ownership, the rapid growth of sales through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription services, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers, as well as the growth in hard discounters, and the current economic environment continue to increase the importance of major customers. In 2018 , sales to Walmart Inc. (Walmart), including Sam’s Club (Sam’s), represented approximately 13% of our consolidated net revenue. Our top five retail customers represented approximately 33% of our 2018 net revenue in North America, with Walmart (including Sam’s) representing approximately 19% . These percentages include concentrate sales to our independent bottlers, which were used in finished goods sold by them to these retailers. See “Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements” in “Our Financial Results – Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for more information on our independent bottlers. Our Competition Our beverage, food and snack products are in highly competitive categories and markets and compete against products of international beverage, food and snack companies that, like us, operate in multiple geographies, as well as regional, local and private label manufacturers and economy brands and other competitors. In many countries in which our products are sold, including the United States, The Coca-Cola Company is our primary beverage competitor. Other beverage, food and snack competitors include, but are not limited to, Campbell Soup Company, Conagra Brands, Inc., Kellogg Company, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., The Kraft Heinz Company, Link Snacks, Inc., Mondelēz International, Inc., Monster Beverage Corporation, Nestlé S.A. and Red Bull GmbH. Many of our food and snack products hold significant leadership positions in the food and snack industry in the United States and worldwide. In 2018 , we and The Coca-Cola Company represented approximately 22% and 20%, respectively, of the U.S. liquid refreshment beverage category by estimated retail sales in measured 6 Table of Contents channels, according to Information Resources, Inc. However, The Coca-Cola Company has significant carbonated soft drink (CSD) share advantage in many markets outside the United States. Our beverage, food and snack products compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition and loyalty, taste, price, value, quality, product variety, innovation, distribution, advertising, marketing and promotional activity, packaging, convenience, service and the ability to anticipate and effectively respond to consumer preferences and trends, including increased consumer focus on health and wellness and the continued acceleration of e-commerce and other methods of distributing and purchasing products. Success in this competitive environment is dependent on effective promotion of existing products, effective introduction of new products and reformulations of existing products, the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns, marketing programs, product packaging, pricing, increased efficiency in production techniques, new vending and dispensing equipment and brand and trademark development and protection. We believe that the strength of our brands, innovation and marketing, coupled with the quality of our products and flexibility of our distribution network, allows us to compete effectively. Research and Development We engage in a variety of research and development activities and invest in innovation globally with the goal of meeting changing consumer demands and preferences and accelerating sustainable growth. These activities principally involve: development of new ingredients, flavors and products; reformulation and improvement in the quality and appeal of existing products; improvement and modernization of manufacturing processes, including cost reduction; improvements in product quality, safety and integrity; development of, and improvements in, dispensing equipment, packaging technology (including investments in recycling-focused technologies), package design (including development of sustainable, bio-based packaging) and portion sizes; efforts focused on identifying opportunities to transform, grow and broaden our product portfolio, including by developing products with improved nutrition profiles that reduce added sugars, sodium or saturated fat, including through the use of sweetener alternatives and flavor modifiers and innovation in existing sweeteners, further expanding our beyond the bottle portfolio (including through our acquisition of SodaStream) and offering more products with positive nutrition including whole grains, fruits and vegetables, dairy, protein and hydration; investments in building our capabilities to support our global e-commerce business; and improvements in energy efficiency and efforts focused on reducing our impact on the environment. Our research centers are located around the world, including in Brazil, China, India, Ireland, Mexico, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States, and leverage nutrition science, food science, engineering and consumer insights to meet our strategy to continue to develop nutritious and convenient beverages, foods and snacks. In 2018 , we continued to refine our beverage, food and snack portfolio to meet changing consumer demands by reducing added sugars in many of our beverages and sodium and saturated fat in many of our foods and snacks, and by developing a broader portfolio of product choices, including: continuing to expand our beverage options that contain no high-fructose corn syrup and that are made with natural flavors; expanding our state-of-the-art food and beverage healthy vending initiative to increase the availability of convenient and affordable nutrition; further expanding our portfolio of nutritious products by building on our important nutrition platforms and brands — Quaker (grains), Tropicana (juices, lemonades, fruit and vegetable drinks), Gatorade (sports nutrition for athletes), Naked Juice (cold-pressed juices and smoothies), KeVita (probiotics, tonics and fermented teas), Bare (baked apple chips and other baked produce) and Health Warrior (nutrition bars); further expanding our whole grain products globally; and further expanding our portfolio of nutritious products in growing categories, such as dairy, hummus and other refrigerated dips, and baked grain snacks. In addition, we continued to make investments to reduce our impact on the environment, including: efforts to conserve raw materials and energy, such as by working to achieve reductions in greenhouse gas emissions across our global businesses, by helping to protect and conserve global water supply especially in high-water-risk locations (including replenishing watersheds that source our operations in high-water-risk locations and 7 Table of Contents promoting the efficient use of water in our agricultural supply chain), and by incorporating improvements in the sustainability and resources of our agricultural supply chain into our operations; efforts to reduce waste generated by our operations and disposed of in landfills; efforts to support increased packaging recovery, recycling rates and the amount of recycled content in our packaging; efforts to increase energy efficiency, including the increased use of renewable energy and resources; efforts to support sustainable agriculture by expanding best practices with our growers and suppliers; and efforts to optimize packaging technology and design to minimize the amount of plastic in our packaging, and make our packaging increasingly recoverable or recyclable with lower environmental impact, including continuing to invest in developing compostable and biodegradable packaging. Regulatory Matters The conduct of our businesses, including the production, storage, distribution, sale, display, advertising, marketing, labeling, content, quality, safety, transportation, packaging, disposal, recycling and use of our products, as well as our employment and occupational health and safety practices and protection of personal information, are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States, as well as to laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies in the more than 200 other countries and territories in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. It is our policy to abide by the laws and regulations around the world that apply to our businesses. The U.S. laws and regulations that we are subject to include: the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and various state laws governing food safety; the Food Safety Modernization Act; the Occupational Safety and Health Act; various federal, state and local environmental protection laws, as discussed below; the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act; the Federal Trade Commission Act; the Lanham Act; various federal and state laws and regulations governing competition and trade practices; various federal and state laws and regulations governing our employment practices, including those related to equal employment opportunity, such as the Equal Employment Opportunity Act and the National Labor Relations Act and those related to overtime compensation, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act; customs and foreign trade laws and regulations, including laws regarding the import or export of our products or ingredients used in our products and tariffs; laws regulating the sale of certain of our products in schools; and laws relating to the payment of taxes. We are also required to comply with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act. We are also subject to various state and local statutes and regulations, including state consumer protection laws such as Proposition 65 in California, which requires that a specific warning appear on any product that contains a substance listed by the State of California as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects, unless the amount of such substance in the product is below a safe harbor level. We are also subject to numerous similar and other laws and regulations outside the United States, including but not limited to laws and regulations governing food safety, international trade and tariffs, occupational health and safety, competition, anti-corruption and data privacy, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation. In many jurisdictions, compliance with competition laws is of special importance to us due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions, as is compliance with anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act. We rely on legal and operational compliance programs, as well as in-house and outside counsel and other experts, to guide our businesses in complying with the laws and regulations around the world that apply to our businesses. In addition, certain jurisdictions have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or commodities used in the production of our products. These taxes vary in scope and form: some apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). Similarly, some measures apply a single tax rate per liquid ounce while others 8 Table of Contents apply a graduated tax rate depending upon the amount of added sugar in the beverage and some apply a flat tax rate on beverages containing a particular substance or ingredient. In addition, certain jurisdictions have either imposed, or are considering imposing, product labeling or warning requirements or other limitations on the marketing or sale of certain of our products as a result of ingredients or substances contained in such products or the audience to whom products are marketed. These types of provisions have required that we provide a label that highlights perceived concerns about a product or warns consumers to avoid consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in our products. It is possible that similar or more restrictive requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future. In addition, certain jurisdictions have either imposed or are considering imposing regulations designed to increase recycling rates or encourage waste reduction. These regulations vary in scope and form from deposit return systems designed to incentivize the return of beverage containers, to extended producer responsibility policies and even bans on the use of some plastic beverage bottles and other single-use plastics. It is possible that similar or more restrictive requirements may be proposed or enacted in the future. We are also subject to national and local environmental laws in the United States and in foreign countries in which we do business, including laws related to water consumption and treatment, wastewater discharge and air emissions. In the United States, our facilities must comply with the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other federal and state laws regarding handling, storage, release and disposal of wastes generated onsite and sent to third-party owned and operated offsite licensed facilities and our facilities outside the United States must comply with similar laws and regulations. In addition, continuing concern over climate change may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements (in or outside of the United States) to reduce or mitigate the potential effects of greenhouse gases, or to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity concerns. Our policy is to abide by all applicable environmental laws and regulations, and we have internal programs in place with respect to our global environmental compliance. We have made, and plan to continue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations. While these expenditures have not had a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations to date, changes in environmental compliance requirements, and any expenditures necessary to comply with such requirements, could adversely affect our financial performance. In addition, we and our subsidiaries are subject to environmental remediation obligations arising in the normal course of business, as well as remediation and related indemnification obligations in connection with certain historical activities and contractual obligations, including those of businesses acquired by us or our subsidiaries. While these environmental remediation and indemnification obligations cannot be predicted with certainty, such obligations have not had, and are not expected to have, a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. In addition to the discussion in this section, see also “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” Employees As of December 29, 2018 , we and our consolidated subsidiaries employed approximately 267,000 people worldwide, including approximately 114,000 people within the United States. In certain countries, our employment levels are subject to seasonal variations. We or our subsidiaries are party to numerous collective bargaining agreements. We expect that we will be able to renegotiate these collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms when they expire. We believe that relations with our employees are generally good.

Information that we post on our corporate website could be deemed material to investors. We encourage investors, the media, our customers, consumers, business partners and others interested in us to review the information we post on these channels. We may from time to time update the list of channels we will use to communicate information that could be deemed material and will post information about any such change on www.pepsico.com . The information on our website is not, and shall not be deemed to be, a part hereof or incorporated into this or any of our other filings with the SEC. Item 1A. Risk Factors. You should carefully consider the risks described below in addition to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. Any of the factors described below could occur or continue to occur and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or the price of our publicly traded securities. The risks below are not the only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us, or that we currently deem to be immaterial, may occur or become material in the future and may also adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations or the price of our publicly traded securities. Therefore, historical operating results, financial and business performance, events and trends may not be a reliable indicator of future operating results, financial and business performance, events or trends. Demand for our products may be adversely affected by changes in consumer preferences or any inability on our part to innovate, market or distribute our products effectively, and any significant reduction in demand could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We are a global food and beverage company operating in highly competitive categories and markets. To generate revenues and profits, we rely on continued demand for our products and therefore must understand our customers and consumers and sell products that appeal to them in the sales channel in which they prefer to shop or browse for such products. In general, changes in consumption in our product categories or consumer demographics could result in reduced demand for our products. Demand for our products depends in part on our ability to anticipate and effectively respond to shifts in consumer trends and preferences, including increased demand for products that meet the needs of consumers who are concerned with: health and wellness (including products that have less added sugars, sodium and saturated fat); convenience (including responding to changes in in-home and on-the-go consumption patterns and methods of distribution of our products to customers and consumers, including through e-commerce and hard discounters); or the location of origin or source of ingredients and products (including the environmental impact related to production of our products). Consumer preferences have been evolving, and are expected to continue to evolve, due to a variety of factors, including: changes in consumer demographics, including the aging of the general population and the emergence of the millennial and younger generations who have differing spending, consumption and purchasing habits; consumer concerns or perceptions regarding the nutrition profile of products, including the presence of added sugar, sodium and saturated fat in certain of our products; growing demand for organic or locally sourced ingredients, or consumer concerns or perceptions (whether or not valid) regarding the 10 Table of Contents health effects of ingredients or substances present in certain of our products, such as 4-MeI, acrylamide, artificial flavors and colors, artificial sweeteners, aspartame, caffeine, furfuryl alcohol, high-fructose corn syrup, partially hydrolyzed oils, saturated fat, sodium, sugar, trans fats or other product ingredients, substances or attributes, including genetically engineered ingredients; taxes or other restrictions, including labeling requirements, imposed on our products; consumer concerns or perceptions regarding packaging materials, including single-use and other plastic packaging, and their environmental impact; changes in package or portion size; changes in social trends that impact travel, vacation or leisure activity patterns; changes in weather patterns or seasonal consumption cycles; the continued acceleration of e-commerce and other methods of purchasing products; negative publicity (whether or not valid) resulting from regulatory actions, litigation against us or other companies in our industry or negative or inaccurate posts or comments in the media, including social media, about us, our employees, our products or advertising campaigns and marketing programs; perception of our employees, agents, customers, suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties or our respective social media posts, business practices or other information disseminated by or regarding them or us; product boycotts; or a downturn in economic conditions. Any of these factors may reduce consumers’ willingness to purchase our products and any inability on our part to anticipate or react to such changes could result in reduced demand for our products or erode our competitive and financial position and could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. Demand for our products is also dependent in part on product quality, product and marketing innovation and production and distribution, including our ability to: maintain a robust pipeline of new products; improve the quality of existing products; extend our portfolio of products in growing markets and categories (through acquisitions, such as SodaStream, and innovation, such as increasing non-carbonated beverage offerings and other alternatives to, or reformulations of, carbonated beverage offerings); respond to cultural differences and regional consumer preferences (whether through developing or acquiring new products that are responsive to such preferences); monitor and adjust our use of ingredients and packaging materials (including to respond to applicable regulations); develop sweetener alternatives and innovation; increase the recyclability or recoverability of our packaging; improve the production and distribution of our products; respond to competitive product and pricing pressures and changes in distribution channels, including in the e-commerce channel; and implement effective advertising campaigns and marketing programs, including successfully adapting to a rapidly changing media environment through the use of social media and online advertising campaigns and marketing programs. Although we devote significant resources to the items mentioned above, there can be no assurance as to our continued ability to develop, launch, maintain or distribute successful new products or variants of existing products in a timely manner (including correctly anticipating or effectively reacting to changes in consumer preferences) or to develop and effectively execute advertising and marketing campaigns that appeal to customers and consumers. Our failure to make the right strategic investments to drive innovation or successfully launch new products or variants of existing products or effectively market or distribute our products could reduce demand for our products, result in inventory write-offs and erode our competitive and financial position and could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Changes in laws and regulations relating to the use or disposal of plastics or other packaging of our products could continue to increase our costs, reduce demand for our products or otherwise have an adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. Certain of our food and beverage products are sold in plastic or other packaging designed to be recoverable for recycling but not all packaging is recovered, whether due to low value, lack of infrastructure or otherwise. In addition, certain of our packaging may currently not be recyclable, compostable or biodegradable. There is a growing concern with the accumulation of plastic and other packaging waste in the environment, 11 Table of Contents particularly in the world’s oceans and waterways. As a result, our branded packaging waste could result in negative publicity (whether or not valid) or reduce consumer demand and overall consumption of our products, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In response to these concerns, the United States and many other jurisdictions have imposed or are considering imposing regulations or policies designed to increase the sustainability of packaging, encourage waste reduction and increase recycling rates or facilitate the waste management process or restricting the sale of products in certain packaging. These regulations vary in scope and form from taxes or fees designed to incentivize behavior to restrictions or bans on certain products and materials. For example, the state of California is one of 10 states in the United States that have a bottle deposit return system in effect, which requires a deposit charged to consumers to incentivize the return of the beverage container. In addition, 26 markets in the European Union have established extended producer responsibility policies, which make manufacturers such as us responsible for the costs of recycling products after consumers have used them. Further, certain jurisdictions are considering imposing other types of regulations or policies, including packaging taxes, requirements for bottle caps to be tethered to the plastic bottle, minimum recycled content mandates, which would require packaging to include a certain percentage of post-consumer recycled material in a new package, and even bans on the use of some plastic beverage bottles and other single-use plastics. These laws and regulations, whatever their scope or form, could increase the cost of our products, reduce consumer demand and overall consumption of our products or result in negative publicity (whether or not valid), which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. While we continue to devote significant resources to increase the recyclability and sustainability of our packaging, the increased focus on reducing plastic waste may require us to increase capital expenditures, including requiring additional investments to minimize the amount of plastic across our packaging; increase the amount of recycled content in our packaging; and develop sustainable, bio-based packaging as a replacement for fossil fuel-based plastic packaging, including flexible film alternatives for our snacks packaging. Our failure to minimize our plastics use, increase the amount of recycled content in our packaging or develop sustainable packaging or consumers’ failure to accept such sustainable packaging could reduce consumer demand and overall consumption of our products and erode our competitive and financial position. Further, our reputation could be damaged for failure to achieve our sustainability goals with respect to our plastics use, including our goal to use 25% recycled content in our plastic packaging by 2025, or if we or others in our industry do not act, or are perceived not to act, responsibly with respect to packaging or disposal of our products. Changes in, or failure to comply with, laws and regulations applicable to our products or our business operations could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. The conduct of our business is subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States, as well as government entities and agencies outside the United States, including laws and regulations relating to the production, storage, distribution, sale, display, advertising, marketing, labeling, content, quality, safety, transportation, packaging, disposal, recycling and use of our products, as well as our employment and occupational health and safety practices and protection of personal information. In addition, in many jurisdictions, compliance with competition laws is of special importance to us due to our competitive position in those jurisdictions, as is compliance with anti-corruption laws. Many of these laws and regulations have differing or conflicting legal standards across the various markets where our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold and, in certain markets, such as developing and emerging markets, may be less developed or certain. For example, products containing genetically engineered ingredients are subject to differing regulations and restrictions in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, as is the packaging, disposal and recyclability of our products. For example, five provinces in Canada, covering most of the Canadian market, have 12 Table of Contents established extended producer responsibility policies, which make manufacturers such as us responsible for the costs of recycling products after consumers have used them. In addition, these laws and regulations and related interpretations may change, sometimes dramatically and unexpectedly, as a result of a variety of factors, including political, economic or social events. Such changes may include changes in: food and drug laws; laws related to product labeling, advertising and marketing practices, including restrictions on the audience to whom products are marketed; laws and treaties related to international trade, including laws regarding the import or export of our products or ingredients used in our products and tariffs; laws and programs aimed at reducing, restricting or eliminating ingredients or substances in, or attributes of, certain of our products; laws and programs aimed at discouraging the consumption or altering the package or portion size of certain of our products, including laws imposing restrictions on the use of government funds or programs to purchase certain of our products; increased regulatory scrutiny of, and increased litigation involving product claims and concerns (whether or not valid) regarding the effects on health of ingredients or substances in, or attributes of, certain of our products, including without limitation those found in energy drinks; state consumer protection laws; laws regulating the protection of personal information; cyber-security regulations; regulatory initiatives, including the imposition or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes or other measures impacting the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products; accounting rules and interpretations; employment laws; privacy laws; laws regulating the price we may charge for our products; laws regulating water rights and access to and use of water or utilities; environmental laws, including laws relating to the regulation of water treatment and discharge of wastewater and air emissions and laws relating to the disposal, recovery or recycling of our products and their packaging. Changes in regulatory requirements or changing interpretations thereof, and differing or competing regulations and standards across the markets where our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, may result in higher compliance costs, capital expenditures and higher production costs, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. The imposition of new laws, regulations or governmental policy and their related interpretations, or changes in any of the foregoing, including taxes, labeling, product, production, recovery or recycling requirements, or other limitations on, or pertaining to, the sale or advertisement of certain of our products, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products, commodities used in the production of our products or use, disposal, recovery or recyclability of our products and their packaging, may further alter the way in which we do business and, therefore, may continue to increase our costs or liabilities or reduce demand for our products, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. If one jurisdiction imposes or proposes to impose new requirements or restrictions, other jurisdictions may follow. For example, if one jurisdiction imposes a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages or foods, or imposes a specific labeling or warning requirement, other jurisdictions may impose similar or other measures that impact the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products. The foregoing may result in decreased demand for our products, adverse publicity or increased concerns about the health implications of consumption of ingredients or substances in our products (whether or not valid). In addition, studies (whether or not scientifically valid) have been and continue to be underway by third parties purporting to assess the health implications of consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in certain of our products or packaging materials, such as 4-MeI, acrylamide, caffeine, glyphosate, furfuryl alcohol, added sugars, sodium, saturated fat and plastic. Third parties have also published documents or studies claiming (whether or not valid) that taxes can address consumer consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and foods high in sugar, sodium or saturated fat. If, as a result of these studies and documents or otherwise, there is an increase in consumer concerns (whether or not valid) about the health implications of consumption of certain of our products, an increase in the number of jurisdictions that impose taxes on our products, or an increase in new labeling, product or production requirements or other restrictions on the manufacturing, sale or display of our products, demand for our products could decline, or we could be subject 13 Table of Contents to lawsuits or new regulations that could affect sales of our products, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Although we have policies and procedures in place that are designed to promote legal and regulatory compliance, our employees, suppliers, or other third parties with whom we do business could take actions, intentional or not, that violate these policies and procedures or applicable laws or regulations or could fail to maintain required documentation sufficient to evidence our compliance with applicable laws or regulations. Failure to comply with such laws or regulations could subject us to criminal or civil enforcement actions, including fines, injunctions, product recalls, penalties, disgorgement of profits or activity restrictions, any of which could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, regulatory authorities under whose laws we operate may have enforcement powers that can subject us to actions such as product recall, seizure of products or assets or other sanctions, which could have an adverse effect on the sales of products in our portfolio or could lead to damage to our reputation. In addition, we and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of legal and environmental remediation obligations arising in the normal course of business, as well as environmental remediation, product liability, toxic tort and related indemnification proceedings in connection with certain historical activities and contractual obligations, including those of businesses acquired by us or our subsidiaries. Due to regulatory complexities, uncertainties inherent in litigation and the risk of unidentified contaminants on current and former properties of ours and our subsidiaries, the potential exists for remediation, liability and indemnification costs to differ materially from the costs we have estimated. We cannot guarantee that our costs in relation to these matters will not exceed our estimates or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The imposition or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes aimed at our products could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or commodities used in the production of our products. These taxes vary in scope and form: some apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). Similarly, some measures apply a single tax rate per liquid ounce while others apply a graduated tax rate depending upon the amount of added sugar in the beverage and some apply a flat tax rate on beverages containing a particular substance or ingredient. For example, effective January 2018, the City of Seattle, Washington in the United States enacted a per-ounce surcharge on all sugar-sweetened beverages. By contrast, France revised an existing flat tax to become a graduated tax, effective July 2018, in which the per-ounce tax rate is tied to the amount of added sugar present in the beverage: the higher the amount of added sugar, the higher the per-ounce tax rate, while Saudi Arabia enacted, effective June 2017, a flat tax rate of 50%, and Jordan increased, effective January 2018, its flat tax from 10% to 20%, on the retail price of carbonated soft drinks. These tax measures, whatever their scope or form, could increase the cost of our products, reduce consumer demand and overall consumption of our products, lead to negative publicity (whether based on scientific fact or not) or leave consumers with the perception (whether or not valid) that our products do not meet their health and wellness needs. Such factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Significant additional labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or sale of our products may reduce demand for such products and could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, product labeling or warning requirements or limitations on the marketing or 14 Table of Contents sale of certain of our products as a result of ingredients or substances contained in such products. These types of provisions have required that we provide a label that highlights perceived concerns about a product or warns consumers to avoid consumption of certain ingredients or substances present in our products. For example, in California in the United States, Proposition 65 requires a specific warning on or relating to any product that contains a substance listed by the State of California as having been found to cause cancer or birth defects or other reproductive harm, unless the level of such substance in the product is below a safe harbor level established by the State of California. In addition, a number of jurisdictions, both in and outside the United States, have imposed or are considering imposing labeling requirements, including color-coded labeling of certain food and beverage products where colors such as red, yellow and green are used to indicate various levels of a particular ingredient, such as sugar, sodium or saturated fat. The imposition or proposed imposition of additional product labeling or warning requirements could reduce overall consumption of our products, lead to negative publicity (whether based on scientific fact or not) or leave consumers with the perception (whether or not valid) that our products do not meet their health and wellness needs. Such factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could suffer if we are unable to compete effectively. Our beverage, food and snack products are in highly competitive categories and markets and compete against products of international beverage, food and snack companies that, like us, operate in multiple geographies, as well as regional, local and private label manufacturers and economy brands and other competitors. In many countries in which our products are sold, including the United States, The Coca-Cola Company is our primary beverage competitor. Other beverage, food and snack competitors include, but are not limited to, Campbell Soup Company, Conagra Brands, Inc., Kellogg Company, Keurig Dr Pepper Inc., The Kraft Heinz Company, Link Snacks, Inc., Mondelēz International, Inc., Monster Beverage Corporation, Nestlé S.A. and Red Bull GmbH. Our beverage, food and snack products compete primarily on the basis of brand recognition and loyalty, taste, price, value, quality, product variety, innovation, distribution, advertising, marketing and promotional activity, packaging, convenience, service and the ability to anticipate and effectively respond to consumer preferences and trends, including increased consumer focus on health and wellness and the continued acceleration of e-commerce and other methods of distributing and purchasing products. If we are unable to effectively promote our existing products or introduce new products, if our advertising or marketing campaigns are not effective, if our competitors spend more aggressively than we do or if we are otherwise unable to effectively respond to pricing pressure or compete effectively (including in distributing our products effectively and cost efficiently through all existing and emerging channels of trade, including through e-commerce and hard discounters), we may be unable to grow or maintain sales or category share or we may need to increase capital, marketing or other expenditures, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Failure to realize anticipated benefits from our productivity initiatives or operating model could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our future success and earnings growth depend, in part, on our ability to continue to reduce costs and improve efficiencies, including implementing shared business service organizational models. Our productivity initiatives help support our growth initiatives and contribute to our results of operations. We continue to implement productivity initiatives that we believe will position our business for long-term sustainable growth by allowing us to achieve a lower cost structure and operate more efficiently in the highly competitive beverage, food and snack categories and markets. We are also continuing to implement our initiatives to 15 Table of Contents improve efficiency, decision making, innovation and brand management across our global organization to enable us to compete more effectively. Further, in order to continue to capitalize on our cost reduction efforts and operating model, it will be necessary to make certain investments in our business, which may be limited due to capital constraints. Some of these measures could yield unintended consequences, such as business disruptions, distraction of management and employees, reduced employee morale and productivity, and unexpected additional employee attrition, including the inability to attract or retain key personnel. It is critical that we have the appropriate personnel in place to continue to lead and execute our plans, including to effectively manage personnel adjustments and transitions resulting from these initiatives and increased competition for employees with the skills necessary to implement our plans. If we are unable to successfully implement our productivity initiatives as planned, fail to implement these initiatives as timely as we anticipate, do not achieve expected savings as a result of these initiatives or incur higher than expected or unanticipated costs in implementing these initiatives, fail to identify and implement additional productivity opportunities in the future, or fail to successfully manage business disruptions or unexpected employee consequences on our workforce, morale or productivity, we may not realize all or any of the anticipated benefits, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of political conditions in the markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. Political conditions in the markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold may be difficult to predict and may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The results of elections, referendums or other political conditions (including government shutdowns) in these markets could impact how existing laws, regulations and government programs or policies are implemented or create uncertainty as to how such laws, regulations and government programs or policies may change, including with respect to tariffs, sanctions, climate change regulation, taxes, benefit programs, the movement of goods, services and people between countries and other matters, and could result in exchange rate fluctuation, volatility in global stock markets and global economic uncertainty or adversely affect demand for our products. For example, the United Kingdom’s pending withdrawal from the European Union (commonly referred to as Brexit) could lead to differing laws and regulations in the United Kingdom and European Union. Any changes in, or the imposition of new laws, regulations or governmental policy and their related interpretations due to elections, referendums or other political conditions could have an adverse impact on our business, financial conditions and results of operations. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected if we are unable to grow our business in developing and emerging markets. Our success depends in part on our ability to grow our business in developing and emerging markets, including Mexico, Russia, the Middle East, Brazil, China and India. However, there can be no assurance that our existing products, variants of our existing products or new products that we make, manufacture, distribute or sell will be accepted or be successful in any particular developing or emerging market, due to local or global competition, product price, cultural differences, consumer preferences or otherwise. The following factors could reduce demand for our products or otherwise impede the growth of our business in developing and emerging markets: unstable economic, political or social conditions; acts of war, terrorist acts, and civil unrest; increased competition; volatility in the economic growth of certain of these markets and the related impact on developed countries who export to these markets; volatile oil prices and the impact on the local economy in certain of these markets; our inability to acquire businesses, form strategic business alliances or to make necessary infrastructure investments; our inability to complete divestitures or refranchisings; imposition of new or increased labeling, product or production requirements, or other restrictions; our inability to hire or retain a highly skilled workforce; imposition of new or increased tariffs and other impositions on imported goods or sanctions against, or other regulations restricting contact with, certain countries in these 16 Table of Contents markets, or imposition of new or increased sanctions against U.S. multinational corporations or tariffs on the products of such corporations operating in these markets; actions, such as removing our products from shelves, taken by retailers in response to U.S. trade sanctions, tariffs or other governmental action or policy; foreign ownership restrictions; nationalization of our assets or the assets of our suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties; imposition of taxes on our products or the ingredients or substances used in our products; government-mandated closure, or threatened closure, of our operations or the operations of our suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners, customers or other third parties; restrictions on the import or export of our products or ingredients or substances used in our products; regulations relating to the repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions to the United States; highly inflationary economies, devaluation or fluctuation, such as the devaluation of the Russian ruble, Turkish lira, Brazilian real, Argentine peso and the Mexican peso, or demonetization of currency; regulations on the transfer of funds to and from foreign countries, currency controls or other currency exchange restrictions, which result in significant cash balances in foreign countries, from time to time, or could significantly affect our ability to effectively manage our operations in certain of these markets and could result in the deconsolidation of such businesses, such as occurred with respect to our Venezuelan businesses which were deconsolidated at the end of the third quarter of 2015; the lack of well-established or reliable legal systems; increased costs of doing business due to compliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act; and adverse consequences, such as the assessment of fines or penalties, for any failure to comply with these laws and regulations. If we are unable to expand our businesses in developing and emerging markets, effectively operate, or manage the risks associated with operating, in these markets, or achieve the return on capital we expect from our investments in these markets, our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. Uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Many of the countries in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold have experienced and may, from time to time, continue to experience uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions, such as recessions or economic slowdowns. Our business or financial results may be adversely impacted by uncertain or unfavorable economic conditions in the United States and globally, including: adverse changes in interest rates, tax laws or tax rates; volatile commodity markets, including speculative influences; highly-inflationary economies, devaluation, fluctuation or demonetization; contraction in the availability of credit in the marketplace due to legislation or economic conditions; the effects of government initiatives, including demonetization, austerity or stimulus measures to manage economic conditions and any changes to or cessation of such initiatives; the effects of any default by or deterioration in the creditworthiness of the countries in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold or of countries that may then impact countries in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold; reduced demand for our products resulting from volatility in general global economic conditions or a shift in consumer preferences for economic reasons or otherwise to regional, local or private label products or other lower-cost products, or to less profitable sales channels; or a decrease in the fair value of pension or post-retirement assets that could increase future employee benefit costs and/or funding requirements of our pension or post-retirement plans. In addition, we cannot predict how current or future economic conditions will affect our customers, consumers, suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties and any negative impact on any of the foregoing may also have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, some of the major financial institutions with which we execute transactions, including U.S. and non-U.S. commercial banks, insurance companies, investment banks and other financial institutions may be 17 Table of Contents exposed to a ratings downgrade, bankruptcy, liquidity events, default or similar risks as a result of unfavorable economic conditions, changing regulatory requirements or other factors beyond our control. A ratings downgrade, bankruptcy, receivership, default or similar event involving a major financial institution, or changes in the regulatory environment, may limit the ability or willingness of financial institutions to enter into financial transactions with us, including to provide banking or related cash management services, or to extend credit on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all; may leave us with reduced borrowing capacity or exposed to certain currencies or price risk associated with forecasted purchases of raw materials, including through our use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and futures; or may result in a decline in the market value of our investments in debt securities, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Similar risks exist with respect to our customers, suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors and joint venture partners and could result in their inability to obtain credit to purchase our products or to finance the manufacture and distribution of our products resulting in canceled orders and/or product delays, which could also have an adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. Our business and reputation could suffer if we are unable to protect our information systems against, or effectively respond to, cyberattacks or other cyber incidents or if our information systems, or those of our customers, suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties, are otherwise disrupted. We depend on information systems and technology, some of which are provided by third parties, including public websites and cloud-based services, for many activities important to our business, including: to interface with our customers and consumers; to engage in marketing activities; to enable and improve the effectiveness of our operations; to order and manage materials from suppliers; to manage inventory; to manage and operate our facilities; to conduct research and development; to maintain accurate financial records; to achieve operational efficiencies; to comply with regulatory, financial reporting, legal and tax requirements; to collect and store sensitive data and confidential information; to communicate electronically among our global operations and with our employees and the employees of our customers, suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners and other third parties; and to communicate with our investors. Cyberattacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently, are constantly evolving in nature, are becoming more sophisticated and are being carried out by groups and individuals (including criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored actors, criminal and terrorist organizations, individuals or groups participating in organized crime and insiders) with a wide range of expertise and motives (including monetization of corporate, payment or other internal or personal data, theft of computing resources, financial fraud, operational disruption, theft of trade secrets and intellectual property for competitive advantage and leverage for political, social, economic and environmental reasons). Such cyberattacks and cyber incidents can take many forms including cyber extortion, denial of service, social engineering, such as impersonation attempts to fraudulently induce employees or others to disclose information or unwittingly provide access to systems or data, introduction of viruses or malware, such as ransomware through phishing emails, website defacement or theft of passwords and other credentials, unauthorized use of computing resources for digital currency mining and business email compromises. As with other global companies, we are regularly subject to cyberattacks, including many of the types of attacks described above. Although we may incur significant costs in protecting against or remediating cyberattacks or other cyber incidents, no cyberattack or other cyber incident has, to our knowledge, had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations to date. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and maintain our information technology infrastructure, including monitoring networks and systems, upgrading our security policies and 18 Table of Contents the skills and training of our employees, and requiring our third-party service providers, customers, suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties to do the same, if we or they fail to timely identify or appropriately respond to cyberattacks or other cyber incidents, or if our or their information systems are damaged, compromised, destroyed or shut down (whether as a result of natural disasters, fires, power outages, acts of terrorism or other catastrophic events, network outages, software, equipment or telecommunications failures, technology development defects, user errors, lapses in our controls or the intentional or negligent actions of employees, or from deliberate cyberattacks such as malicious or disruptive software, denial of service attacks, malicious social engineering, hackers or otherwise), our business could be disrupted and we could, among other things, be subject to: transaction errors; processing inefficiencies; the loss of, or failure to attract, new customers and consumers; lost revenues resulting from the disruption or shutdown of computer systems or other information technology systems at our offices, plants, warehouses, distribution centers or other facilities, or the loss of a competitive advantage due to the unauthorized use, acquisition or disclosure of, or access to, confidential information; the incurrence of costs to restore data and to safeguard against future extortion attempts; the loss of, or damage to, intellectual property or trade secrets, including the loss or unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data or other assets; alteration, corruption or loss of accounting, financial or other data on which we rely for financial reporting and other purposes, which could cause errors or delays in our financial reporting; damage to our reputation or brands; damage to employee, customer and consumer relations; litigation; regulatory enforcement actions or fines; unauthorized disclosure of confidential personal information of our employees, customers or consumers; the loss of information and/or supply chain disruption resulting from the failure of security patches to be developed and installed on a timely basis; violation of data privacy, security or other laws and regulations; and remediation costs. Further, our information systems and those of our third-party providers, and the information stored therein could be compromised, including through cyberattacks or other external or internal methods, resulting in unauthorized parties accessing or extracting sensitive data or confidential information. Failure to comply with data privacy laws could result in litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations. We continue to devote significant resources to network security, backup and disaster recovery, enhancing our internal controls, and other security measures, including training, to protect our systems and data, but these security measures cannot provide absolute security or guarantee that we will be successful in preventing or responding to every such breach or disruption. In addition, due to the constantly evolving nature of these security threats, the form and impact of any future incident cannot be predicted. Similar risks exist with respect to the cloud-based service providers and other third-party vendors that we rely upon for aspects of our information technology support services and administrative functions, including payroll processing, health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions, and systems managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third parties and their vendors. The need to coordinate with various third-party vendors may complicate our efforts to resolve any issues that may arise. As a result, we are subject to the risk that the activities associated with our third-party vendors may adversely affect our business even if the attack or breach does not directly impact our systems or information. Moreover, our increased use of mobile and cloud technologies could heighten these and other operational risks, as certain aspects of the security of such technologies may be complex, unpredictable or beyond our control. While we currently maintain insurance coverage that, subject to its terms and conditions, is intended to address costs associated with certain aspects of cyber incidents, network failures and data privacy-related concerns, this insurance coverage may not, depending on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding an incident, cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise from an incident, or the damage to our reputation or brands that may result from an incident. 19 Table of Contents Our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected by increased costs, disruption of supply or shortages of raw materials, energy, water and other supplies. We and our business partners use various raw materials, energy, water and other supplies in our business. The principal ingredients we use in our beverage, food and snack products are apple, orange and pineapple juice and other juice concentrates, aspartame, corn, corn sweeteners, flavorings, flour, grapefruit, oats, oranges and other fruits, potatoes, raw milk, rice, seasonings, sucralose, sugar, vegetable and essential oils, and wheat. We also use water in the manufacturing of our products. Our key packaging materials include plastic resins, including PET and polypropylene resins used for plastic beverage bottles and film packaging used for snack foods, aluminum used for cans, glass bottles, closures, cardboard and paperboard cartons. Fuel, electricity and natural gas are also important commodities for our businesses due to their use in our and our business partners’ facilities and the vehicles delivering our products. Some of these raw materials and supplies are sourced from countries experiencing civil unrest, political instability or unfavorable economic conditions, and some are available from a limited number of suppliers or a sole supplier or are in short supply when seasonal demand is at its peak. We cannot assure that we will be able to maintain favorable arrangements and relationships with these suppliers or that our contingency plans, including development of ingredients, materials or supplies to replace ingredients, materials or supplies sourced from such suppliers, will be effective in preventing disruptions that may arise from shortages or discontinuation of any ingredient that is sourced from such suppliers. In addition, increasing focus on climate change, deforestation, water, animal welfare and human rights concerns and other risks associated with the global food system may lead to increased activism focusing on consumer goods companies, governmental intervention and consumer response, and could adversely affect our or our suppliers’ reputation and business and our ability to procure the materials we need to operate our business. The raw materials and energy, including fuel, that we use for the manufacturing, production and distribution of our products are largely commodities that are subject to price volatility and fluctuations in availability caused by many factors, including changes in global supply and demand, weather conditions (including any potential effects of climate change), fire, natural disasters (such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake or flooding), disease or pests (including the impact of greening disease on the citrus industry), agricultural uncertainty, health epidemics or pandemics, governmental incentives and controls (including import/export restrictions, such as new or increased tariffs, sanctions, quotas or trade barriers), limited or sole sources of supply, political uncertainties, acts of terrorism, governmental instability or currency exchange rates. For example, in 2018, the United States imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as on goods imported from China and certain other countries, which has resulted in retaliatory tariffs by China and other countries. Additional tariffs imposed by the United States on a broader range of imports, or further retaliatory trade measures taken by China or other countries in response, could result in an increase in supply chain costs that we may not be able to offset or otherwise adversely impact our results of operations. Shortage of some of these raw materials and other supplies, sustained interruption in their supply or an increase in their costs could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Many of our ingredients, raw materials and commodities are purchased in the open market. The prices we pay for such items are subject to fluctuation, and we manage this risk through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, including swaps and futures. If commodity price changes result in unexpected or significant increases in raw materials and energy costs, we may be unwilling or unable to increase our product prices or unable to effectively hedge against commodity price increases to offset these increased costs without suffering reduced volume, revenue, margins and operating results. In addition, certain of the derivatives used to hedge price risk do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment and, therefore, can result in increased volatility in our net earnings in any given period due to changes in the spot prices of the underlying commodities. 20 Table of Contents Water is a limited resource in many parts of the world. The lack of available water of acceptable quality and increasing pressure to conserve water in areas of scarcity and stress may lead to: supply chain disruption; adverse effects on our operations; higher compliance costs; capital expenditures (including additional investments in the development of technologies to enhance water efficiency and reduce water consumption); higher production costs; the cessation of operations at, or relocation of, our facilities or the facilities of our suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties; or damage to our reputation, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Business disruptions could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our ability, and that of our suppliers and other third parties, including our bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners and customers, to make, manufacture, transport, distribute and sell products in our portfolio is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our or their operations due to any of the following factors could impair the ability to make, manufacture, transport, distribute or sell products in our portfolio: adverse weather conditions (including any potential effects of climate change) or natural disasters, such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake or flooding; government action; economic or political uncertainties or instability in countries in which such products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, which may also affect our ability to protect the security of our assets and employees; fire; terrorism; outbreak or escalation of armed hostilities; food safety warnings or recalls, whether related to products in our portfolio or otherwise; health epidemics or pandemics; supply and commodity shortages; unplanned delays or unexpected problems associated with repairs or enhancements of facilities in which such products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold; loss or impairment of key manufacturing sites; cyber incidents, including the disruption or shutdown of computer systems or other information technology systems at our offices, plants, warehouses, distribution centers or other facilities or those of our suppliers and other third parties who make, manufacture, transport, distribute and sell products in our portfolio; industrial accidents or other occupational health and safety issues; telecommunications failures; power or water shortages; strikes, labor disputes or lack of availability of qualified personnel, such as truck drivers; or other reasons beyond our control or the control of our suppliers and other third parties. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, as well as require additional resources to restore operations. Product contamination or tampering or issues or concerns with respect to product quality, safety and integrity could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. Product contamination or tampering, the failure to maintain high standards for product quality, safety and integrity, including with respect to raw materials and ingredients obtained from suppliers, or allegations (whether or not valid) of product quality issues, mislabeling, misbranding, spoilage, allergens, adulteration or contamination with respect to products in our portfolio may reduce demand for such products, and cause production and delivery disruptions or increase costs, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the products in our portfolio are mislabeled or become unfit for consumption or cause injury, illness or death, or if appropriate resources are not devoted to product quality and safety (particularly as we expand our portfolio into new categories) or to comply with changing food safety requirements, we could decide to, or be required to, recall products in our portfolio and/or we may be subject to liability or government action, which could result in payment of damages or fines, cause certain products in our portfolio to be unavailable for a period of time, result in destruction of product inventory, or result in adverse publicity (whether or not valid), which could reduce consumer demand and brand equity. Moreover, even if allegations of product contamination or tampering or suggestions that our products were not fit for consumption are meritless, the negative publicity surrounding assertions against us or products in our portfolio or processes could adversely affect our reputation or brands. Our business could 21 Table of Contents also be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in product quality, safety and integrity generally, even if such loss of confidence is unrelated to products in our portfolio. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, if we do not have adequate insurance, if we do not have enforceable indemnification from suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties or if indemnification is not available, the liability relating to such product claims or disruption as a result of recall efforts could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Any damage to our reputation or brand image could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We are a leading global beverage, food and snack company with brands that are respected household names throughout the world. Maintaining a good reputation globally is critical to selling our branded products. Our reputation or brand image could be adversely impacted by any of the following, or by adverse publicity (whether or not valid) relating thereto: the failure to maintain high ethical, social and environmental practices for all of our operations and activities, including with respect to human rights, child labor laws and workplace conditions and safety, or failure to require our suppliers or other third parties to do so; the failure to achieve our goals of reducing added sugars, sodium and saturated fat in certain of our products and of growing our portfolio of product choices; the failure to achieve our other sustainability goals, including with respect to plastic packaging, or to be perceived as appropriately addressing matters of social responsibility; the failure to protect our intellectual property, including in the event our brands are used without our authorization; health concerns (whether or not valid) about our products or particular ingredients or substances in, or attributes of, our products, including concerns regarding whether certain of our products contribute to obesity; the imposition or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes, labeling requirements or other limitations on, or pertaining to, the sale, display or advertising of our products; any failure to comply, or perception of a failure to comply, with our policies and goals, including those regarding advertising to children and reducing calorie consumption from sugar-sweetened beverages; our research and development efforts; the recall (voluntary or otherwise) of any products in our portfolio; our environmental impact, including use of agricultural materials, plastics or other packaging, water, energy use and waste management; any failure to achieve our goals with respect to reducing our impact on the environment, including the recyclability or recoverability of our packaging, or perception of a failure to act responsibly with respect to water use and the environment; any failure to achieve our goals with respect to human rights throughout our value chain; the practices of our employees, agents, customers, suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties (including others in our industry) with respect to any of the foregoing, actual or perceived; consumer perception of our industry; consumer perception of our advertising campaigns, sponsorship arrangements or marketing programs; consumer perception of our use of social media; consumer perception of statements made by us, our employees and executives, agents, customers, suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties (including others in our industry); or our responses or the responses of others in our industry to any of the foregoing. In addition, we operate globally, which requires us to comply with numerous local regulations, including, without limitation, anti-corruption laws, competition laws and tax laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. In the event that we or our employees engage in or are believed to have engaged in improper activities, we may be subject to regulatory proceedings, including enforcement actions, litigation, loss of sales or other consequences, which may cause us to suffer damage to our reputation in the United States or abroad. Failure to comply with local laws and regulations, to maintain an effective system of internal control or to provide accurate and timely financial information could also hurt our reputation. In addition, water is a limited resource in many parts of the world and demand for water continues to rise. Our reputation could be damaged if we or others in our industry do not act, or are perceived not to act, responsibly with respect to water use. 22 Table of Contents Further, the popularity of social media and other consumer-oriented technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination. As a result, negative or inaccurate posts or comments about us, our products, policies, practices, advertising campaigns and marketing programs or sponsorship arrangements; our use of social media or of posts or other information disseminated by us or our employees, agents, customers, suppliers, bottlers, contract manufacturers, distributors, joint venture partners or other third parties; consumer perception of any of the foregoing, or failure by us to respond effectively to any of the foregoing, may also generate adverse publicity (whether or not valid) that could damage our reputation. Damage to our reputation or brand image or loss of consumer confidence in our products or employees for any of these or other reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation. Failure to successfully complete or integrate acquisitions and joint ventures into our existing operations, or to complete or effectively manage divestitures or refranchisings, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We regularly review our portfolio of businesses and evaluate potential acquisitions, joint ventures, divestitures, refranchisings and other strategic transactions. Potential issues associated with these activities could include, among other things: our ability to realize the full extent of the expected returns, benefits, cost savings or synergies as a result of a transaction, within the anticipated time frame, or at all; receipt of necessary consents, clearances and approvals in connection with a transaction; and diversion of management’s attention from day-to-day operations. With respect to acquisitions, including our recently completed acquisition of SodaStream, the following factors also pose potential risks: our ability to successfully combine our businesses with the business of the acquired company, including integrating the acquired company’s manufacturing, distribution, sales, accounting, financial reporting and administrative support activities and information technology systems with our company; our ability to successfully operate in new categories or territories; motivating, recruiting and retaining executives and key employees (both of the acquired company and our company); conforming standards, controls (including internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, environmental compliance, health and safety compliance and compliance with other laws and regulations), procedures and policies, business cultures and compensation structures between us and the acquired company; consolidating and streamlining corporate and administrative infrastructures and avoiding increased operating expenses; consolidating sales and marketing operations; retaining existing customers and attracting new customers; retaining existing distributors; identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming operations and assets; coordinating geographically dispersed organizations; managing tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating our operations following completion of an acquisition; and other unanticipated problems or liabilities, such as contingent liabilities and litigation. With respect to joint ventures, we share ownership and management responsibility with one or more parties who may or may not have the same goals, strategies, priorities, resources or values as we do. Joint ventures are intended to be operated for the benefit of all co-owners, rather than for our exclusive benefit. Business decisions or other actions or omissions of our joint venture partners may adversely affect the value of our investment, result in litigation or regulatory action against us or otherwise damage our reputation and brands and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, acquisitions and joint ventures outside of the United States increase our exposure to risks associated with operations outside of the United States, including fluctuations in exchange rates and compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and laws and regulations outside the United States. 23 Table of Contents With respect to divestitures and refranchisings, we may not be able to complete or effectively manage such transactions on terms commercially favorable to us or at all and may fail to achieve the anticipated benefits or cost savings from the divestiture or refranchising. Further, as divestitures and refranchisings may reduce our direct control over certain aspects of our business, any failure to maintain good relations with divested or refranchised businesses in our supply or sales chain may adversely impact our sales or business performance. If an acquisition or joint venture is not successfully completed, integrated into our existing operations or managed effectively, or if a divestiture or refranchising is not successfully completed or managed effectively or does not result in the benefits or cost savings we expect, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected. A change in our estimates and underlying assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses could result in an impairment charge, which could materially affect our results of operations. We conduct impairment tests on our goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, as well as other investments and other long-lived assets annually, during our third quarter, or more frequently if circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Any changes in our estimates or underlying assumptions regarding the future performance of our reporting units or in determining the fair value of any such reporting unit, including goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, as well as other investments and other long-lived assets, could adversely affect our results of operations. Factors that could result in an impairment include, but are not limited to: significant negative economic or industry trends or competitive operating conditions; significant macroeconomic conditions that may result in a future increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value; and significant changes in the nature and timing of decisions regarding assets or markets that do not perform consistent with our expectations, including factors we use to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. Future impairment charges could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations in the periods recognized. Increases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws or disagreements with tax authorities could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We are subject to income taxes in the United States and in certain foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. Increases in income tax rates or other changes in income tax laws in any particular jurisdiction could reduce our after-tax income from such jurisdiction and could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our operations outside the United States generate a significant portion of our income. In addition, the United States and many of the other countries in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, including countries in which we have significant operations, have recently made or are actively considering changes to existing tax laws. For example, in December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJ Act) was signed into law in the United States. While our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act is deemed to be complete, these amounts are based on prevailing regulations and currently available information, and any additional guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) could impact our recorded amounts in future periods. For further information regarding the impact and potential impact of the TCJ Act, see “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Our Critical Accounting Policies” in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements. Additional changes in the U.S. tax regime or in how U.S. multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings, including changes in how existing tax laws are interpreted or enforced, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. For example, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has recommended changes to numerous long-standing international tax principles through its base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project. These changes, to the extent adopted, 24 Table of Contents may increase tax uncertainty, result in higher compliance costs and adversely affect our provision for income taxes, results of operations and/or cash flow. We are also subject to regular reviews, examinations and audits by the IRS and other taxing authorities with respect to income and non-income based taxes both within and outside the United States. In connection with the OECD’s BEPS project, companies are required to disclose more information to tax authorities on operations around the world, which may lead to greater audit scrutiny of profits earned in various countries. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenues in jurisdictions in which we operate, or the adoption of new or reformed tax legislation or regulation, may make resolving tax disputes more difficult and the final resolution of tax audits and any related litigation could differ from our historical provisions and accruals, resulting in an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If we are unable to recruit, hire or retain key employees or a highly skilled and diverse workforce, it could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our continued growth requires us to recruit, hire, retain and develop our leadership bench and a highly skilled and diverse workforce. We compete to recruit and hire new employees and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies. Our employees are highly sought after by our competitors and other companies and our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to retain, develop and motivate highly skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. Any unplanned turnover or unsuccessful implementation of our succession plans to backfill current leadership positions, including the Chief Executive Officer, or to hire and retain a highly skilled and diverse workforce could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitive advantage or result in increased costs due to increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. The loss of, or a significant reduction in sales to, any key customer could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our customers include wholesale and other distributors, foodservice customers, grocery stores, drug stores, convenience stores, discount/dollar stores, mass merchandisers, membership stores, hard discounters, e-commerce retailers and authorized independent bottlers, among others. We must maintain mutually beneficial relationships with our key customers, including Wal-Mart, to compete effectively. Any inability to resolve a significant dispute with any of our key customers, a change in the business condition (financial or otherwise) of any of our key customers, even if unrelated to us, a significant reduction in sales to any key customer, or the loss of any of our key customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Disruption in the retail landscape, including rapid growth in hard discounters and the e-commerce channel, could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our industry has been affected by changes to the retail landscape, including the rapid growth in sales through e-commerce websites, mobile commerce applications and subscription services as well as the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers. We continue to make significant investments in attracting talent to and building our global e-commerce capabilities. Although we are engaged in e-commerce with respect to many of our products, if we are unable to maintain and develop successful relationships with existing and new e-commerce retailers or otherwise adapt to the growing e-commerce landscape, while simultaneously maintaining relationships with our key customers operating in traditional retail channels, we may be disadvantaged in certain channels and with certain customers and consumers, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, the growth in e-commerce and hard discounters may result in consumer price deflation, which may affect our relationships with key retail 25 Table of Contents customers. Further, the ability of consumers to compare prices on a real-time basis using digital technology puts additional pressure on us to maintain competitive prices. If these e-commerce and hard discounter retailers were to take significant market share away from traditional retailers and/or we fail to adapt to the rapidly changing retail and e-commerce landscapes, our ability to maintain and grow our profitability, share of sales or volume and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. Further, the retail landscape continues to be impacted by the increased consolidation of retail ownership and purchasing power, particularly in North America, Europe and Latin America, resulting in large retailers with increased purchasing power, which may impact our ability to compete in these areas. Such retailers may demand improved efficiency, lower pricing and increased promotional programs. Further, should larger retailers increase utilization of their own distribution networks, other distribution channels such as e-commerce, or private label brands, the competitive advantages we derive from our go-to-market systems and brand equity may be eroded. In addition, the growth of hard discounters that are focused on limiting the number of items they sell and selling predominantly private label brands may reduce our ability to sell our products through such retailers. Failure to appropriately respond to any of the foregoing, including failure to offer effective sales incentives and marketing programs to our customers, could reduce our ability to secure adequate shelf space and product availability at our retailers, adversely affect our ability to maintain or grow our share of sales or volume, and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our borrowing costs and access to capital and credit markets may be adversely affected by a downgrade or potential downgrade of our credit ratings. Rating agencies routinely evaluate us, and their ratings of our long-term and short-term debt are based on a number of factors, including our cash generating capability, levels of indebtedness, policies with respect to shareholder distributions and our financial strength generally, as well as factors beyond our control, such as the then-current state of the economy and our industry generally. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, whether as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increase our future borrowing costs, impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all, and result in a reduction in our liquidity. We expect to maintain Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global credit markets at favorable interest rates. However, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. Our borrowing costs and access to the commercial paper market could also be adversely affected if a credit rating agency announces that our ratings are under review for a potential downgrade. An increase in our borrowing costs, limitations on our ability to access the global capital and credit markets or a reduction in our liquidity could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. If we are not able to successfully implement shared services or utilize information technology systems and networks effectively, our ability to conduct our business may be negatively impacted. We have entered into agreements with third-party service providers to utilize information technology support services and administrative functions in certain areas of our business, including payroll processing, health and benefit plan administration and certain finance and accounting functions. We may enter into new or additional agreements for shared services in other functions in the future to achieve cost savings and efficiencies as we continue to migrate to shared business service organizational models across our business operations. In addition, we utilize cloud-based services and systems and networks managed by third-party vendors to process, transmit and store information and to conduct certain of our business activities and transactions with employees, customers, consumers and other third parties. If any of these third-party service 26 Table of Contents providers or vendors do not perform effectively, or if we fail to adequately monitor their performance (including compliance with service level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements), we may not be able to achieve the expected cost savings, we may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers, our reputation could be harmed or we could be subject to litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations. Depending on the function involved, such errors may also lead to business disruption, processing inefficiencies, the loss of or damage to intellectual property or sensitive data through security breaches or otherwise, incorrect or adverse effects on financial reporting, litigation or remediation costs, or damage to our reputation, which could have a negative impact on employee morale. In addition, the management of multiple third-party service providers increases operational complexity and decreases our control. We continue on our multi-year business transformation initiative to migrate certain of our systems, including our financial processing systems, to enterprise-wide systems solutions. These systems implementations are part of our ongoing global business transformation initiative, and we plan to continue implementing such systems throughout other parts of our businesses. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper information technology infrastructure, or if we fail to achieve the expected benefits from this initiative, it may impact our ability to process transactions accurately and efficiently, and remain in step with the changing needs of our business, which could result in the loss of customers or consumers and revenue. In addition, the failure to either deliver the applications on time, or anticipate the necessary readiness and training needs, could lead to business disruption and loss of customers or consumers and revenue. In connection with these implementations and resulting business process changes, we continue to enhance the design and documentation of business processes and controls, including our internal control over financial reporting processes, to maintain effective controls over our financial reporting. To date, this transition has not materially affected, and we do not expect it to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. Fluctuations in exchange rates impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We hold assets, incur liabilities, earn revenues and pay expenses in a variety of currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside the United States, where the functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar, are translated into U.S. dollars. Our operations outside of the United States, particularly in Mexico, Russia, Canada, the United Kingdom and Brazil , generate a significant portion of our net revenue. In addition, we purchase many of the ingredients, raw materials and commodities used in our business in numerous markets and in numerous currencies. Fluctuations in exchange rates, including as a result of currency controls or other currency exchange restrictions have had, and may continue to have, an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Climate change, water scarcity or legal, regulatory or market measures to address climate change or water scarcity may negatively affect our business and operations or damage our reputation. There is concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as sugar cane, corn, wheat, rice, oats, oranges and other fruits and potatoes. Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions, such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake or flooding, may disrupt the productivity of our facilities or the operation of our supply chain and unfavorably impact the demand for, or our consumers’ ability to purchase, our products. The predicted effects of climate change may also exacerbate challenges regarding the availability and quality of water. As demand for water access continues to increase 27 Table of Contents around the world, we may be subject to decreased availability of water, deteriorated quality of water or less favorable pricing for water, which could adversely impact our manufacturing and distribution operations. Concern over climate change may result in new or increased regional, federal and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases, or to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity concerns. In the event that such regulation is more stringent than current regulatory obligations or the measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor and improve our energy efficiency and water conservation, we may experience disruptions in, or significant increases in our costs of, operation and delivery and we may be required to make additional investments in facilities and equipment or relocate our facilities. In particular, increasing regulation of fuel emissions could substantially increase the cost of energy, including fuel, required to operate our facilities or transport and distribute our products, thereby substantially increasing the distribution and supply chain costs associated with our products. As a result, the effects of climate change or water scarcity could negatively affect our business and operations. In addition, any failure to achieve our goals with respect to reducing our impact on the environment or perception (whether or not valid) of our failure to act responsibly with respect to water use and the environment or to effectively respond to new, or changes in, legal or regulatory requirements concerning climate change or water scarcity could result in adverse publicity and could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations. There is also increased focus, including by governmental and non-governmental organizations, investors, customers and consumers on these and other environmental sustainability matters, including deforestation, land use, climate impact, water use and recyclability or recoverability of packaging, including plastic. Our reputation could be damaged if we or others in our industry do not act, or are perceived not to act, responsibly with respect to our impact on the environment. A portion of our workforce is represented by unions. Failure to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements, or strikes or work stoppages, could cause our business to suffer. Many of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements, and other employees may seek to be covered by collective bargaining agreements. Strikes or work stoppages or other business interruptions could occur if we are unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms or enter into new agreements on satisfactory terms or if we are unable to otherwise manage changes in, or that affect, our workforce, which could impair manufacturing and distribution of our products or result in a loss of sales, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations. The terms and conditions of existing, renegotiated or new collective bargaining agreements could also increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully implement future operational changes to enhance our efficiency or to adapt to changing business needs or strategy. If we are not able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights or if we are found to infringe the intellectual property rights of others, the value of our products or brands, or our competitive position, could be reduced, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We possess intellectual property rights that are important to our business. These intellectual property rights include ingredient formulas, trademarks, copyrights, patents, business processes and other trade secrets that are important to our business and relate to a variety of our products, their packaging, the processes for their production and the design and operation of various equipment used in our businesses. We protect our intellectual property rights globally through a combination of trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret laws, third-party assignment and nondisclosure agreements and monitoring of third-party misuses of our 28 Table of Contents intellectual property. If we fail to obtain or adequately protect our trademarks, copyrights, patents, business processes and trade secrets, including our ingredient formulas, or if there is a change in law that limits or removes the current legal protections of our intellectual property, the value of our products and brands, or our competitive position, could be reduced and there could be an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, if, in the course of developing new products or improving the quality of existing products, we are found to have infringed the intellectual property rights of others, directly or indirectly, such finding could have an adverse impact on our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations and may limit our ability to introduce new products or improve the quality of existing products. Potential liabilities and costs from litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations, including but not limited to matters related to our advertising, marketing or commercial practices, product labels, claims and ingredients including sugar, sodium and saturated fat, our intellectual property rights, alleged infringement or misappropriation by us of intellectual property rights of others, environmental, privacy, employment, tax and insurance matters and matters relating to our compliance with applicable laws and regulations. We evaluate such matters to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses and establish reserves as appropriate. These matters are inherently uncertain and there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves in these matters, or that our assessment of the materiality of these matters and the likely outcome or potential losses and established reserves will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such matters. In the event that management’s assessment of actual or potential claims and proceedings proves inaccurate or litigation, claims, proceedings, inquiries or investigations that are material arise in the future, there may be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Responding to litigation, claims, proceedings, inquiries, and investigations, even those that are ultimately non-meritorious, may also require us to incur significant expense and devote significant resources, and may generate adverse publicity that may damage our reputation or brand image, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Many factors may adversely affect the price of our publicly traded securities. Many factors may adversely affect the price of our common stock and publicly traded debt. Such factors, some of which are beyond our control, may include, but are not limited to: unfavorable economic conditions; changes in financial or tax reporting and changes in accounting principles or practices that materially affect our reported financial condition and results; investor perceptions of our business, strategies and performance or those of our competitors; actions by shareholders or others seeking to influence our business strategies; speculation by the media or investment community regarding our business, strategies and performance or those of our competitors; developments relating to pending litigation, claims, inquiries or investigations; changes in laws and regulations applicable to our products or business operations; trading activity in our securities or trading activity in derivative instruments with respect to our securities; changes in our credit ratings; the impact of our share repurchase programs or dividend policy; and the outcome of referenda and elections. In addition, corporate actions, such as those we may or may not take from time to time as part of our continuous review of our corporate structure and our strategy, including as a result of business, legal, regulatory and tax considerations, may not have the impact we intend and may adversely affect the price of our securities. The above factors, as well as the other risks included in this “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” could adversely affect the price of our securities. 29 Table of Contents Item 1B. Unresolved Staff Comments. We have received no written comments regarding our periodic or current reports from the staff of the SEC that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of our 2018 fiscal year and that remain unresolved. 30 Table of Contents Item 2. Properties. Our principal executive offices located in Purchase, New York and our facilities located in Plano, Texas, all of which we own, are our most significant corporate properties. Each division utilizes plants, warehouses, distribution centers, storage facilities, offices and other facilities, either owned or leased, in connection with making, marketing, distributing and selling our products. The approximate number of such facilities utilized by each division is as follows: FLNA QFNA NAB Latin America ESSA AMENA Shared (a) Plants (b) 35 5 65 45 85 45 5 Other Facilities (c) 1,660 4 440 575 350 335 45 (a) Shared properties are in addition to the other properties reported by our six divisions identified in this table. (b) Includes manufacturing and processing plants as well as bottling and production plants. (c) Includes warehouses, distribution centers, storage facilities, offices, including division headquarters, research and development facilities and other facilities. Significant properties by division included in the table above are as follows: • FLNA’s research and development facility in Plano, Texas, which is owned. • QFNA’s food plant in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, which is owned. • NAB’s research and development facility in Valhalla, New York, and a Tropicana plant in Bradenton, Florida, both of which are owned. • Latin America’s three snack plants in Mexico (one in Vallejo, one in Celaya and one in Obregón) and one in Brazil (Sorocaba), all of which are owned. • ESSA’s snack plant in Leicester, United Kingdom, which is leased; its snack plant in Kashira, Russia, its fruit juice plant in Zeebrugge, Belgium, its beverage plant in Lebedyan, Russia and its dairy plant in Moscow, Russia, all of which are owned. • AMENA’s two beverage plants in Egypt (one in Tanta City and one in Sixth of October City) and its snack plant in Wuhan, China, all of which are owned; and its snack plant in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, which is leased. • Two concentrate plants in Cork, Ireland, which are shared by our NAB, ESSA and AMENA segments, both of which are owned; and one in Singapore, which is shared by our NAB and AMENA segments, which is leased. • Shared service centers in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and Plano, Texas, which are primarily shared by our FLNA, QFNA and NAB segments, both of which are leased. Most of our plants are owned or leased on a long-term basis. In addition to company-owned or leased properties described above, we also utilize a highly distributed network of plants, warehouses and distribution centers that are owned or leased by our contract manufacturers, co-packers, strategic alliances or joint ventures in which we have an equity interest. We believe that our properties generally are in good operating condition and, taken as a whole, are suitable, adequate and of sufficient capacity for our current operations. 31 Table of Contents Item 3. Legal Proceedings. As previously disclosed, in April 2017, Corporación Autónoma Regional de Cundinamarca, a Colombian environmental authority (the environmental authority), initiated an administrative proceeding regarding our subsidiary, PepsiCo Alimentos Z.F., Ltda. (PAZ), for allegedly delivering wastewater to a third party without first verifying that the third party had appropriate permits with respect to the discharge of such wastewater. In July 2018, the environmental authority initiated an administrative proceeding to impose a monetary sanction against PAZ with respect to the alleged permitting violation by the third party, and on August 13, 2018, PAZ submitted evidence of its defense to these allegations. If the environmental authority determines PAZ is responsible for the alleged permitting violations by the third party, the environmental authority may seek to impose monetary sanctions of up to $1.3 million, which PAZ would be entitled to appeal. In addition, we and our subsidiaries are party to a variety of litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations. While the results of such litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries and investigations cannot be predicted with certainty, management believes that the final outcome of the foregoing will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Sanctions imposed by foreign authorities are levied in local currency and disclosed using the U.S. dollar equivalent at the time of imposition and are subject to currency fluctuations.

OUR BUSINESS Executive Overview We are a leading global food and beverage company with a complementary portfolio of brands, including Frito-Lay, Gatorade, Pepsi-Cola, Quaker and Tropicana. Through our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a wide variety of convenient beverages, foods and snacks, serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories. At PepsiCo, we are focused on an approach called Winning with Purpose that will help make our company faster, stronger and better at meeting the needs of our customers, consumers, partners and communities, while caring for our planet and inspiring our associates. Our strategies are designed to address key challenges facing our Company, including: shifting consumer preferences and behaviors; a highly competitive operating environment; a rapidly changing retail landscape, including the growth in e-commerce; continued macroeconomic and political volatility; and an evolving regulatory landscape. We intend to focus on the following areas to address and adapt to these challenges: • Winning in the marketplace and accelerating growth by strengthening and broadening our portfolio, while focusing on locally meeting the needs of our consumers and customers; • Continuing to implement our productivity initiatives to improve our operational efficiency and enhance our competitive advantage while continuing to transform our core capabilities with technology and building and retaining a talented workforce to drive cost savings; and • Continuing to lead with purpose by focusing on our impact on the planet and our people, assisting in establishing a more sustainable food system, minimizing our impact on the environment, protecting human rights and securing supply while positioning our Company for sustainable growth. We believe these priorities will position our Company for long-term sustainable growth. See also “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for additional information about risks and uncertainties that the Company faces. Our Operations See “Item 1. Business” for information on our divisions and a description of our distribution network, ingredients and other supplies, brands and intellectual property rights, seasonality, customers and competition. In addition, see Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for financial information about our divisions and geographic areas. 44 Table of Contents Other Relationships Certain members of our Board of Directors also serve on the boards of certain vendors and customers. These Board members do not participate in our vendor selection and negotiations nor in our customer negotiations. Our transactions with these vendors and customers are in the normal course of business and are consistent with terms negotiated with other vendors and customers. In addition, certain of our employees serve on the boards of Pepsi Bottling Ventures LLC and other affiliated companies of PepsiCo and do not receive incremental compensation for such services. Our Business Risks We are subject to risks in the normal course of business. During 2018 and 2017 , certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold operated in a challenging environment, experiencing unstable economic, political and social conditions, civil unrest, natural disasters, debt and credit issues, and currency fluctuations. We continue to monitor the economic, operating and political environment in these markets closely and to identify actions to potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results. In addition, certain jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold have either imposed, or are considering imposing, new or increased taxes or regulations on the manufacture, distribution or sale of our products or their packaging, ingredients or substances contained in, or attributes of, our products or their packaging, commodities used in the production of our products or their packaging or the recyclability or recoverability of our packaging. These taxes and regulations vary in scope and form. For example, some taxes apply to all beverages, including non-caloric beverages, while others apply only to beverages with a caloric sweetener (e.g., sugar). In addition, some regulations apply to all products using certain types of packaging (e.g., plastic), while others are designed to increase the sustainability of packaging and encourage waste reduction and increased recycling rates. We sell a wide variety of beverages, foods and snacks in more than 200 countries and territories and the profile of the products we sell, the amount of revenue attributable to such products and the type of packaging used varies by jurisdiction. Because of this, we cannot predict the scope or form potential taxes, regulations or other limitations on our products or their packaging may take, and therefore cannot predict the impact of such taxes, regulations or limitations on our financial results. In addition, taxes, regulations and limitations may impact us and our competitors differently. We continue to monitor existing and proposed taxes and regulations in the jurisdictions in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed and sold and to consider actions we may take to potentially mitigate the unfavorable impact, if any, of such taxes, regulations or limitations, including advocating alternative measures with respect to the imposition, form and scope of any such taxes, regulations or limitations. In addition, our industry continues to be affected by disruption of the retail landscape, including the rapid growth in sales through e-commerce websites and mobile commerce applications, including through subscription services, the integration of physical and digital operations among retailers and the international expansion of hard discounters. We continue to monitor changes in the retail landscape and to identify actions we may take to build our global e-commerce capabilities, distribute our products effectively through all existing and emerging channels of trade and potentially mitigate any unfavorable impacts on our future results. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. As a result of the enactment of the TCJ Act, we recognized a provisional net tax expense of $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2017. In 2018, we recognized a net tax benefit of $28 million in connection with the TCJ Act. See further information in “Items Affecting Comparability.” While our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act is deemed to be complete, these amounts are based on prevailing regulations and currently available information, and any additional guidance issued by the IRS could impact the aforementioned amounts in future periods. For 45 Table of Contents additional information, see “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources,” “Our Critical Accounting Policies” and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements. See also “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Executive Overview” above and “Market Risks” below for more information about these risks and the actions we have taken to address key challenges. Risk Management Framework The achievement of our strategic and operating objectives involves taking risks and that those risks may evolve over time. To identify, assess, prioritize, address, manage, monitor and communicate these risks across the Company’s operations, we leverage an integrated risk management framework. This framework includes the following: • PepsiCo’s Board of Directors has oversight responsibility for PepsiCo’s integrated risk management framework. One of the Board’s primary responsibilities is overseeing and interacting with senior management with respect to key aspects of the Company’s business, including risk assessment and risk mitigation of the Company’s top risks. The Board receives updates on key risks throughout the year, including risks related to cybersecurity. In addition, the Board has tasked designated Committees of the Board with oversight of certain categories of risk management, and the Committees report to the Board regularly on these matters. ◦ The Audit Committee of the Board reviews and assesses the guidelines and policies governing PepsiCo’s risk management and oversight processes, and assists the Board’s oversight of financial, compliance and employee safety risks facing PepsiCo; ◦ The Compensation Committee of the Board reviews PepsiCo’s employee compensation policies and practices to assess whether such policies and practices could lead to unnecessary risk-taking behavior; ◦ The Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee assists the Board in its oversight of the Company’s governance structure and other corporate governance matters, including succession planning; and ◦ The Public Policy and Sustainability Committee of the Board assists the Board in its oversight of PepsiCo’s policies, programs and related risks that concern key public policy and sustainability matters. • The PepsiCo Risk Committee (PRC), which is comprised of a cross-functional, geographically diverse, senior management group, including PepsiCo’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, meets regularly to identify, assess, prioritize and address top strategic, financial, operating, compliance, safety, reputational and other risks. The PRC is also responsible for reporting progress on our risk mitigation efforts to the Board; • Division and key country risk committees, comprised of cross-functional senior management teams, meet regularly to identify, assess, prioritize and address division and country-specific business risks; • PepsiCo’s Risk Management Office, which manages the overall risk management process, provides ongoing guidance, tools and analytical support to the PRC and the division and key country risk committees, identifies and assesses potential risks and facilitates ongoing communication between the parties, as well as with PepsiCo’s Board of Directors and the Audit Committee of the Board; • PepsiCo’s Corporate Audit Department evaluates the ongoing effectiveness of our key internal controls through periodic audit and review procedures; and • PepsiCo’s Compliance & Ethics and Law Departments lead and coordinate our compliance policies and practices. 46 Table of Contents Market Risks We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in: • commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy; • foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and • interest rates. In the normal course of business, we manage commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of strategies, including productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs and hedging. Ongoing productivity initiatives involve the identification and effective implementation of meaningful cost-saving opportunities or efficiencies, including the use of derivatives. Our global purchasing programs include fixed-price contracts and purchase orders and pricing agreements. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion of our market risks, and see “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” for further information on our non-cancelable purchasing commitments. The fair value of our derivatives fluctuates based on market rates and prices. The sensitivity of our derivatives to these market fluctuations is discussed below. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these derivatives and our hedging policies. See “Our Critical Accounting Policies” for a discussion of the exposure of our pension and retiree medical plan assets and liabilities to risks related to market fluctuations. Inflationary, deflationary and recessionary conditions impacting these market risks also impact the demand for and pricing of our products. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion. Commodity Prices Our commodity derivatives had a total notional value of $1.1 billion as of December 29, 2018 and $0.9 billion as of December 30, 2017 . At the end of 2018 , the potential change in fair value of commodity derivative instruments, assuming a 10% decrease in the underlying commodity price, would have increased our net unrealized losses in 2018 by $100 million . Foreign Exchange Our operations outside of the United States generated 43% of our consolidated net revenue in 2018 , with Mexico, Russia, Canada, the United Kingdom and Brazil comprising approximately 20% of our consolidated net revenue in 2018 . As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risks in the international markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. During 2018 , unfavorable foreign exchange reduced net revenue growth by one percentage point due to declines in the Russian ruble, Turkish lira and Brazilian real. Currency declines against the U.S. dollar which are not offset could adversely impact our future financial results. In addition, volatile economic, political and social conditions and civil unrest in certain markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold, including in Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Mexico, the Middle East, Russia and Turkey, and currency fluctuations in certain of these international markets continue to result in challenging operating environments. We also continue to monitor the economic and political developments related to the United Kingdom’s pending withdrawal from the European Union, including how the United Kingdom will interact with other European Union countries following its departure, as well as the economic, operating and political environment in Russia, and the potential impact for the ESSA segment and our other businesses. Our foreign currency derivatives had a total notional value of $2.0 billion as of December 29, 2018 and $1.6 billion as of December 30, 2017 . The total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net 47 Table of Contents investment hedges was $0.9 billion as of December 29, 2018 and $1.5 billion as of December 30, 2017 . At the end of 2018 , we estimate that an unfavorable 10% change in the underlying exchange rates would have decreased our net unrealized gains in 2018 by $149 million . Interest Rates Our interest rate derivatives had a total notional value of $10.5 billion as of December 29, 2018 and $14.2 billion as of December 30, 2017 . Assuming year-end 2018 investment levels and variable rate debt, a 1-percentage-point increase in interest rates would have increased our net interest expense in 2018 by $7 million due to lower cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments levels as compared with our variable rate debt. 48 Table of Contents OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS Results of Operations — Consolidated Review In the discussions of net revenue and operating profit below, “effective net pricing” reflects the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries, and “net pricing” reflects the year-over-year combined impact of list price changes, weight changes per package, discounts and allowances. Additionally, “acquisitions and divestitures,” except as otherwise noted, reflect all mergers and acquisitions activity, including the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and changes in ownership or control in consolidated subsidiaries and nonconsolidated equity investees. Volume Our beverage volume in the NAB, Latin America, ESSA and AMENA segments reflects sales to authorized bottlers, independent distributors and retailers, as well as the sale of beverages bearing Company-owned or licensed trademarks that have been sold through our authorized independent bottlers. Bottler case sales (BCS) and concentrate shipments and equivalents (CSE) are not necessarily equal during any given period due to seasonality, timing of product launches, product mix, bottler inventory practices and other factors. While our beverage revenues are not entirely based on BCS volume, as there are independent bottlers in the supply chain, we believe that BCS is a valuable measure as it quantifies the sell-through of our beverage products at the consumer level. Sales of products from our unconsolidated joint ventures are reflected in our reported volume. NAB, Latin America, ESSA and AMENA, either independently or in conjunction with third parties, make, market, distribute and sell ready-to-drink tea products through a joint venture with Unilever (under the Lipton brand name), and NAB, either independently or in conjunction with third parties, makes, markets, distributes and sells ready-to-drink coffee products through a joint venture with Starbucks. In addition, AMENA licenses the Tropicana brand for use in China on co-branded juice products in connection with a strategic alliance with Tingyi. Our food and snack volume in the FLNA, QFNA, Latin America, ESSA and AMENA segments is reported on a system-wide basis, which includes our own sales and the sales by our noncontrolled affiliates of snacks bearing Company-owned or licensed trademarks. Servings Since our divisions each use different measures of physical unit volume (i.e., kilos, gallons, pounds and case sales), a common servings metric is necessary to reflect our consolidated physical unit volume. Our divisions’ physical volume measures are converted into servings based on U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidelines for single-serving sizes of our products. In 2018 , total servings increased 1% compared to 2017 . In 2017 , total servings decreased 1% compared to 2016 . Excluding the impact of the 53 rd reporting week in 2016, total servings in 2017 was even with the prior year. Servings growth reflects adjustments to the prior year results for divestitures and other structural changes. 49 Table of Contents Consolidated Net Revenue and Operating Profit Change 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 Net revenue $ 64,661 $ 63,525 $ 62,799 2 % 1 % Operating profit (a) $ 10,110 $ 10,276 $ 9,804 (2 )% 5 % Operating profit margin (a) 15.6 % 16.2 % 15.6 % (0.5 ) 0.6 (a) In 2017 and 2016, operating profit and operating profit margin reflect the retrospective adoption of guidance requiring the presentation of non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost below operating profit. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. See “Results of Operations – Division Review” for a tabular presentation and discussion of key drivers of net revenue. 2018 Operating profit decreased 2% and operating profit margin declined 0.5 percentage points. The operating profit performance was driven by certain operating cost increases and a 6-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, partially offset by productivity savings of more than $1 billion and net revenue growth. The impact of refranchising a portion of our beverage business in Jordan in 2017 and a prior-year gain associated with the sale of our minority stake in Britvic negatively impacted operating profit performance by 2.5 percentage points. These impacts were offset by a 2-percentage-point positive impact of refranchising a portion of our beverage business in Thailand and our entire beverage bottling operations and snack distribution operations in CHS in 2018. Items affecting comparability (see “Items Affecting Comparability”) negatively impacted operating profit performance by 3 percentage points and decreased operating profit margin by 0.5 percentage points, primarily due to higher mark-to-market net impact on commodity derivatives included in corporate unallocated expenses. 2017 Operating profit increased 5% and operating profit margin improved 0.6 percentage points. Operating profit growth was driven by productivity savings of more than $1 billion and effective net pricing, partially offset by certain operating cost increases, a 7-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs and unfavorable foreign exchange. The impact of refranchising a portion of our beverage business in Jordan and a gain associated with the sale of our minority stake in Britvic each contributed 1 percentage point to operating profit growth. Items affecting comparability (see “Items Affecting Comparability”) also contributed 2 percentage points to operating profit growth and increased operating profit margin by 0.2 percentage points, primarily reflecting a prior-year impairment charge to reduce the value of our 5% indirect equity interest in KSFB to its estimated fair value. 50 Table of Contents Other Consolidated Results Change 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 Other pension and retiree medical benefits income/(expense) (a) $ 298 $ 233 $ (19 ) $ 65 $ 252 Net interest expense $ (1,219 ) $ (907 ) $ (1,232 ) $ (312 ) $ 325 Annual tax rate (b) (36.7 )% 48.9 % 25.4 % Net income attributable to PepsiCo $ 12,515 $ 4,857 $ 6,329 158 % (23 )% Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted $ 8.78 $ 3.38 $ 4.36 160 % (23 )% Mark-to-market net impact 0.09 (0.01 ) (0.08 ) Restructuring and impairment charges 0.18 0.16 0.09 Merger and integration charges 0.05 — — Net tax (benefit)/expense related to the TCJ Act (b) (0.02 ) 1.70 — Other net tax benefits (b) (3.55 ) — — Charges related to cash tender and exchange offers 0.13 — — Charge related to the transaction with Tingyi — — 0.26 Charge related to debt redemption — — 0.11 Pension-related settlement charge — — 0.11 Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, excluding above items (c) $ 5.66 $ 5.23 $ 4.85 8 % 8 % Impact of foreign exchange translation 1 1 Growth in net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, excluding above items, on a constant currency basis (c) 9 % 9 % (a) In 2017 and 2016, reflect the retrospective adoption of guidance requiring the presentation of non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost below operating profit. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. (b) See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements. (c) See “Non-GAAP Measures.” 2018 Other pension and retiree medical benefits income increased $65 million , reflecting the impact of the $1.4 billion discretionary pension contribution to the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan A (Plan A) in the United States, as well as the recognition of net asset gains, partially offset by higher amortization of net losses. Net interest expense increased $312 million reflecting a charge of $253 million in connection with our cash tender and exchange offers, primarily representing the tender price paid over the carrying value of the tendered notes. This increase also reflects higher interest rates on debt balances, as well as losses on the market value of investments used to economically hedge a portion of our deferred compensation liability. These impacts were partially offset by higher interest income due to higher interest rates on cash balances. The reported tax rate decreased 85.6 percentage points, reflecting both other net tax benefits related to the reorganization of our international operations, which reduced the reported tax rate by 45 percentage points, and the prior year provisional net tax expense related to the TCJ Act, which reduced the current year reported tax rate by 25 percentage points. Additionally, the favorable conclusion of certain international tax audits and the favorable resolution with the IRS of all open matters related to the audits of taxable years 2012 and 2013, collectively, reduced the reported tax rate by 7 percentage points. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for further information. 51 Table of Contents Net income attributable to PepsiCo increased 158% and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share increased 160% . Items affecting comparability (see “Items Affecting Comparability”) positively contributed 150 percentage points to net income attributable to PepsiCo growth and 152 percentage points to net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share growth. 2017 Other pension and retiree medical benefits income increased $252 million , primarily reflecting a settlement charge of $242 million related to the purchase of a group annuity contract in 2016. Net interest expense decreased $325 million reflecting a charge of $233 million in 2016 representing the premium paid in accordance with the “make-whole” redemption provisions to redeem all of our outstanding 7.900% senior notes due 2018 and 5.125% senior notes due 2019 for the principal amounts of $1.5 billion and $750 million, respectively. This decrease also reflects higher interest income due to higher interest rates and average cash balances, as well as gains on the market value of investments used to economically hedge a portion of our deferred compensation liability. These impacts were partially offset by higher interest expense due to higher average debt balances. The reported tax rate increased 23.5 percentage points primarily as a result of the provisional net tax expense related to the TCJ Act, which contributed 26 percentage points to the increase, partially offset by the impact of the 2016 impairment charge to reduce the value of our 5% indirect equity interest in KSFB to its estimated fair value, which had no corresponding tax benefit, as well as the impact of recognizing excess tax benefits in the provision for income taxes as a result of the changes in accounting for certain aspects of share-based payments to employees in 2017. See Note 2 and Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information. Net income attributable to PepsiCo and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share both decreased 23%. Items affecting comparability (see “Items Affecting Comparability”) negatively impacted both net income attributable to PepsiCo performance and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share performance by 30 percentage points, primarily as a result of the provisional net tax expense related to the TCJ Act. Non-GAAP Measures Certain financial measures contained in this Form 10-K adjust for the impact of specified items and are not in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to make operating and strategic decisions, including the preparation of our annual operating plan, evaluation of our overall business performance and as a factor in determining compensation for certain employees. We believe presenting non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K provides additional information to facilitate comparison of our historical operating results and trends in our underlying operating results, and provides additional transparency on how we evaluate our business. We also believe presenting these measures in this Form 10-K allows investors to view our performance using the same measures that we use in evaluating our financial and business performance and trends. We consider quantitative and qualitative factors in assessing whether to adjust for the impact of items that may be significant or that could affect an understanding of our ongoing financial and business performance or trends. Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring programs; charges or adjustments related to the enactment of new laws, rules or regulations, such as significant tax law changes; amounts related to the resolution of tax positions; tax benefits related to reorganizations of our operations; gains or losses associated with mergers, acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes; debt redemptions, cash tender or exchange offers; pension and retiree medical related items; asset impairments (non-cash); and 52 Table of Contents remeasurements of net monetary assets. See below and “Items Affecting Comparability” for a description of adjustments to our U.S. GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K. Non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. In addition, our non-GAAP financial measures may not be the same as or comparable to similar non-GAAP measures presented by other companies. The following non-GAAP financial measures are contained in this Form 10-K: • cost of sales, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, other pension and retiree medical benefits income/expense, interest expense, benefit from/provision for income taxes and noncontrolling interests, each adjusted for items affecting comparability; • operating profit, adjusted for items affecting comparability, and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, adjusted for items affecting comparability, and the corresponding constant currency growth rates; • organic revenue growth; • free cash flow; and • return on invested capital (ROIC) and net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability. Cost of Sales, Gross Profit, Selling, General and Administrative Expenses, Other Pension and Retiree Medical Benefits Income/Expense, Interest Expense, Benefit from/Provision for Income Taxes, Annual Tax Rate and Noncontrolling Interests, Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability; Operating Profit, Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability, and Net Income Attributable to PepsiCo per Common Share – Diluted, Adjusted for Items Affecting Comparability, and the Corresponding Constant Currency Growth Rates These measures exclude the net impact of mark-to-market gains and losses on centrally managed commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting, restructuring and impairment charges related to our 2019 and 2014 Productivity Plans, merger and integration charges associated with our acquisition of SodaStream, net tax benefit/expense associated with the enactment of the TCJ Act, other net tax benefits, charges related to cash tender and exchange offers, a charge related to the transaction with Tingyi, a charge related to debt redemption, and a pension-related settlement charge (see “Items Affecting Comparability” for a detailed description of each of these items). We also evaluate performance on operating profit, adjusted for items affecting comparability, and net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share – diluted, adjusted for items affecting comparability, on a constant currency basis, which measure our financial results assuming constant foreign currency exchange rates used for translation based on the rates in effect for the comparable prior-year period. In order to compute our constant currency results, we multiply or divide, as appropriate, our current year U.S. dollar results by the current year average foreign exchange rates and then multiply or divide, as appropriate, those amounts by the prior-year average foreign exchange rates. We believe these measures provide useful information in evaluating the results of our business because they exclude items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing performance. We are not able to reconcile our full year projected 2019 annual tax rate, excluding items affecting comparability, to our full year projected 2019 reported annual tax rate because we are unable to predict the 2019 impact of foreign exchange or the mark-to-market net impact on commodity derivatives due to the unpredictability of future changes in foreign exchange rates and commodity prices. Therefore, we are unable to provide a reconciliation of this measure. Organic Revenue Growth We define organic revenue growth as net revenue growth adjusted for the impact of foreign exchange translation, as well as the impact from acquisitions, divestitures and other structural changes. Our 2018 reported results reflect the accounting policy election taken in conjunction with the adoption of the revenue 53 Table of Contents recognition guidance to exclude from net revenue and cost of sales all sales, use, value-added and certain excise taxes assessed by governmental authorities on revenue-producing transactions not already excluded. Our 2018 organic revenue growth excludes the impact of approximately $75 million of these taxes previously recognized in net revenue. In addition, our fiscal 2016 reported results included an extra week of results. Our 2017 organic revenue growth excludes the impact of the 53rd reporting week from our 2016 results. We believe organic revenue provides useful information in evaluating the results of our business because it excludes items that we believe are not indicative of ongoing performance or that we believe impact comparability with the prior year. See “Net Revenue and Organic Revenue Growth” in “Results of Operations – Division Review.” Free Cash Flow We define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less capital spending, plus sales of property, plant and equipment. Since net capital spending is essential to our product innovation initiatives and maintaining our operational capabilities, we believe that it is a recurring and necessary use of cash. As such, we believe investors should also consider net capital spending when evaluating our cash from operating activities. Free cash flow is used by us primarily for financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. Free cash flow is not a measure of cash available for discretionary expenditures since we have certain non-discretionary obligations such as debt service that are not deducted from the measure. See “Free Cash Flow” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources.” ROIC and Net ROIC, Excluding Items Affecting Comparability We define ROIC as net income attributable to PepsiCo plus interest expense after-tax divided by the sum of quarterly average debt obligations and quarterly average common shareholders’ equity. Although ROIC is a common financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating ROIC. Accordingly, the method used by management to calculate ROIC may differ from the methods other companies use to calculate their ROIC. We believe this metric serves as a measure of how well we use our capital to generate returns. In addition, we use net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability, to compare our performance over various reporting periods on a consistent basis because it removes from our operating results the impact of items that are not indicative of our ongoing performance and reflects how management evaluates our operating results and trends. We define net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability, as ROIC, adjusted for quarterly average cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, after-tax interest income and items affecting comparability. We believe the calculation of ROIC and net ROIC, excluding items affecting comparability, provides useful information to investors and is an additional relevant comparison of our performance to consider when evaluating our capital allocation efficiency. See “Return on Invested Capital” in “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources.” 54 Table of Contents Items Affecting Comparability Our reported financial results in this Form 10-K are impacted by the following items in each of the following years: 2018 Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Interest expense (Benefit from)/provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 29,381 $ 35,280 $ 25,170 $ 10,110 $ 298 $ 1,525 $ (3,370 ) $ 44 $ 12,515 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact (83 ) 83 (80 ) 163 — — 38 — 125 Restructuring and impairment charges (3 ) 3 (269 ) 272 36 — 56 1 251 Merger and integration charges — — (75 ) 75 — — — — 75 Net tax benefit related to the TCJ Act — — — — — — 28 — (28 ) Other net tax benefits — — — — — — 5,064 — (5,064 ) Charges related to cash tender and exchange offers — — — — — (253 ) 62 — 191 Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 29,295 $ 35,366 $ 24,746 $ 10,620 $ 334 $ 1,272 $ 1,878 $ 45 $ 8,065 2017 (b) Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits income Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 28,796 $ 34,729 $ 24,453 $ 10,276 $ 233 $ 4,694 $ 4,857 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact 8 (8 ) 7 (15 ) — (7 ) (8 ) Restructuring and impairment charges — — (229 ) 229 66 71 224 Provisional net tax expense related to the TCJ Act — — — — — (2,451 ) 2,451 Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 28,804 $ 34,721 $ 24,231 $ 10,490 $ 299 $ 2,307 $ 7,524 55 Table of Contents 2016 (b) Cost of sales Gross profit Selling, general and administrative expenses Operating profit Other pension and retiree medical benefits (expense)/income Interest expense Provision for income taxes (a) Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests Net income attributable to PepsiCo Reported, GAAP Measure $ 28,222 $ 34,577 $ 24,773 $ 9,804 $ (19 ) $ 1,342 $ 2,174 $ 50 $ 6,329 Items Affecting Comparability Mark-to-market net impact 78 (78 ) 89 (167 ) — — (56 ) — (111 ) Restructuring and impairment charges — — (155 ) 155 5 — 26 3 131 Charge related to the transaction with Tingyi — — (373 ) 373 — — — — 373 Charge related to debt redemption — — — — — (233 ) 77 — 156 Pension-related settlement charge — — — — 242 — 80 — 162 Core, Non-GAAP Measure $ 28,300 $ 34,499 $ 24,334 $ 10,165 $ 228 $ 1,109 $ 2,301 $ 53 $ 7,040 (a) Benefit from/provision for income taxes is the expected tax benefit/charge on the underlying item based on the tax laws and income tax rates applicable to the underlying item in its corresponding tax jurisdiction and tax year. (b) Reflects the retrospective adoption of guidance requiring the presentation of non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost below operating profit. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. Mark-to-Market Net Impact We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include energy, agricultural products and metals . Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in corporate unallocated expenses. Restructuring and Impairment Charges 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan Our 2019 Productivity Plan, publicly announced on February 15, 2019, will leverage new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. In connection with this program, we expect to incur pre-tax charges of approximately $2.5 billion, of which $138 million is included in our 2018 results, approximately $800 million is expected to be reflected in our 2019 results and the balance to be reflected in our 2020 through 2023 results. These pre-tax charges will consist of approximately 70% of severance and other employee-related costs, 15% for asset impairments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related actions, and 15% for other costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives. We expect that these pre-tax charges will result in cash expenditures of approximately $1.6 billion, of which we expect approximately $450 million to be reflected in our 2019 cash flows and the balance to be reflected in our 2020 through 2023 cash flows. We expect to incur the majority of the pre-tax charges and cash expenditures in our 2019 and 2020 results. 56 Table of Contents The total expected program pre-tax charges are expected to be incurred by division approximately as follows: FLNA QFNA NAB Latin America ESSA AMENA Corporate Expected pre-tax charges 10 % 3 % 35 % 12 % 25 % 13 % 2 % 2014 Multi-Year Productivity Plan To build on the successful implementation of the 2014 Productivity Plan, we expanded and extended the program through the end of 2019 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives of the 2014 Productivity Plan to further strengthen our beverage, food and snack businesses. In connection with this program, we expect to incur pre-tax charges and cash expenditures of approximately $1.3 billion and $960 million, respectively. This total pre-tax charge is expected to consist of approximately 55% of severance and other employee-related costs, 15% for asset impairments (all non-cash) resulting from plant closures and related actions, and 30% for other costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives. To date, we have incurred $1.2 billion of pre-tax charges and $814 million of cash expenditures. We expect to complete the program and incur the program’s remaining pre-tax charges and cash expenditures before the end of 2019. The total expected program pre-tax charges are expected to be incurred by division approximately as follows: FLNA QFNA NAB Latin America ESSA AMENA Corporate Expected pre-tax charges 14 % 3 % 30 % 15 % 20 % 6 % 12 % See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further information related to our 2019 and 2014 Productivity Plans. We regularly evaluate productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plans and other initiatives discussed above and in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. Merger and Integration Charges In 2018, we incurred merger and integration charges of $75 million ($0.05 per share) related to our acquisition of SodaStream, including $57 million recorded in the ESSA segment and $18 million recorded in corporate unallocated expenses. These charges include closing costs, advisory fees and employee-related costs . See Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements. Net Tax (Benefit)/Expense Related to the TCJ Act During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. Among its many provisions, the TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings and reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. In 2017, we recorded a provisional net tax expense of $2.5 billion ($1.70 per share) associated with the enactment of the TCJ Act. Included in the provisional net tax expense of $2.5 billion was a provisional mandatory one-time transition tax of approximately $4 billion on undistributed international earnings, included in other liabilities. This mandatory one-time transition tax was partially offset by a provisional $1.5 billion benefit resulting from the required remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the new, lower U.S. corporate income tax rate. In 2018, we recorded a net tax benefit of $28 million ($0.02 per share) in connection with the TCJ Act. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements. 57 Table of Contents Other Net Tax Benefits In 2018, we reorganized our international operations, including the intercompany transfer of certain intangible assets. As a result, we recognized other net tax benefits of $4.3 billion ($3.05 per share). Also in 2018, we recognized non-cash tax benefits associated with both the conclusion of certain international tax audits and our agreement with the IRS resolving all open matters related to the audits of taxable years 2012 and 2013. The conclusion of certain international tax audits and the resolution with the IRS resulted in non-cash tax benefits of $364 million ($0.26 per share) and $353 million ($0.24 per share), respectively. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements. Charges Related to Cash Tender and Exchange Offers In 2018, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $253 million ($191 million after-tax or $0.13 per share) to interest expense in connection with our cash tender and exchange offers, primarily representing the tender price paid over the carrying value of the tendered notes. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements. Charge Related to the Transaction with Tingyi In 2016, we recorded a pre- and after-tax impairment charge of $373 million ($0.26 per share) in the AMENA segment to reduce the value of our 5% indirect equity interest in KSFB to its estimated fair valu e. See Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements. Charge Related to Debt Redemption In 2016, we paid $2.5 billion to redeem all of our outstanding 7.900% senior notes due 2018 and 5.125% senior notes due 2019 for the principal amounts of $1.5 billion and $750 million, respectively, and terminated certain interest rate swaps. As a result, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $233 million ($156 million after-tax or $0.11 per share) to interest expense, primarily representing the premium paid in accordance with the “make-whole” redemption provisions. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements. Pension-Related Settlement Charge In 2016, we recorded a pre-tax pension settlement charge in corporate unallocated expenses of $242 million ($162 million after-tax or $0.11 per share) related to the purchase of a group annuity contract. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. 58 Table of Contents Results of Operations — Division Review The results and discussions below are based on how our Chief Executive Officer monitors the performance of our divisions.

In certain instances, volume growth varies from the amounts disclosed in the following divisional discussions due to nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our beverage businesses, temporary timing differences between BCS and CSE, as well as the mix of beverage volume sold by our Company-owned and franchise-owned bottlers. Our net revenue excludes nonconsolidated joint venture volume, and, for our franchise-owned beverage businesses, is based on CSE. (c) Includes the year-over-year impact of discrete pricing actions, sales incentive activities and mix resulting from selling varying products in different package sizes and in different countries. (d) Our fiscal 2016 results included a 53rd reporting week which increased 2016 net revenue by $657 million, including $294 million in our FLNA segment, $43 million in our QFNA segment, $300 million in our NAB segment and $20 million in our ESSA segment. Our 2017 organic revenue growth excludes the impact of the 53rd reporting week from our 2016 results. 59 Table of Contents Frito-Lay North America % Change 2018 2017 (a) 2016 (a) 2018 2017 Net revenue $ 16,346 $ 15,798 $ 15,549 3.5 2 Impact of foreign exchange translation — — Impact of acquisitions and divestitures — — Impact of 53 rd reporting week — 2 Organic revenue growth (b) 3 (d) 3 (d) Operating profit $ 5,008 $ 4,793 $ 4,612 4.5 4 Restructuring and impairment charges (c) 36 54 12 Operating profit excluding above item (b) $ 5,044 $ 4,847 $ 4,624 4 5 Impact of foreign exchange translation — — Operating profit growth excluding above item, on a constant currency basis (b) 4 5 (a) In 2017 and 2016, operating profit and restructuring and impairment charges reflect the retrospective adoption of guidance requiring the presentation of non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost below operating profit.

Volume grew 1%, reflecting mid-single-digit growth in variety packs and low-single-digit growth in trademark Doritos, partially offset by a double-digit decline in Santitas. Operating profit grew 4.5%, primarily reflecting the net revenue growth and productivity savings, partially offset by certain operating cost increases and a 1-percentage-point impact of a bonus extended to certain U.S. employees in connection with the TCJ Act. 2017 Net revenue grew 2%, primarily reflecting effective net pricing, partially offset by the impact of the 53 rd reporting week in 2016, which reduced net revenue growth by 2 percentage points. Volume declined 1%, reflecting mid-single-digit declines in trademark Lay’s and Fritos and a low-single-digit decline in trademark Doritos, partially offset by high-single-digit growth in variety packs. The 53 rd reporting week in 2016 negatively impacted volume performance by 2 percentage points. Operating profit grew 4%, primarily reflecting productivity savings, the effective net pricing and a 1-percentage-point impact of 2016 incremental investments into our business. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases, including strategic initiatives, and a 1-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily cooking oil.

The net revenue performance reflects unfavorable net pricing and mix and the volume decline. The volume decline was driven by a double-digit decline in trademark Gamesa and a mid-single-digit decline in ready-to-eat cereals, partially offset by mid-single-digit growth in oatmeal. Operating profit decreased slightly, reflecting certain operating cost increases, the net revenue performance and a 3-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs. These impacts were partially offset by productivity savings, lower advertising and marketing expenses and a 1-percentage-point positive contribution from insurance settlement recoveries related to the 2017 earthquake in Mexico. 2017 Net revenue declined 2%, reflecting the impact of the 53 rd reporting week in 2016, which negatively impacted net revenue performance by 2 percentage points, as well as unfavorable mix. Volume declined 2%, reflecting a low-single-digit decline in ready-to-eat cereals and high-single-digit declines in trademark Roni and Gamesa, in part reflecting the impact of the 53 rd reporting week in 2016 which negatively impacted volume performance by 2 percentage points. Operating profit decreased 1%, reflecting certain operating cost increases and the net revenue performance. The 53 rd reporting week in 2016 negatively impacted operating profit performance by 2 percentage points. These impacts were partially offset by productivity savings, lower advertising and marketing expenses and a 1.5-percentage-point impact of 2016 incremental investments into our business.

Volume decreased 1%, driven by a 3% decline in CSD volume, partially offset by a 2% increase in non-carbonated beverage volume. The non-carbonated beverage volume increase primarily reflected a high-single-digit increase in our overall water portfolio. Additionally, a low-single-digit increase in Gatorade sports drinks was offset by a low-single-digit decline in our juice and juice drinks portfolio. Operating profit decreased 16%, reflecting certain operating cost increases, including increased transportation costs, a 7-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs and higher advertising and marketing expenses. These impacts were partially offset by productivity savings and the net revenue growth. Higher gains on asset sales positively contributed 1.5 percentage points to operating profit performance. A bonus extended to certain U.S. employees in connection with the TCJ Act negatively impacted operating profit performance by 1.5 percentage points and was partially offset by prior-year costs related to hurricanes which positively contributed 1 percentage point to operating profit performance. 2017 Net revenue decreased 2%, primarily reflecting a decline in volume, partially offset by effective net pricing, as well as acquisitions which positively contributed 1 percentage point to the net revenue performance. The 53 rd reporting week in 2016 negatively impacted net revenue performance by 1 percentage point. Volume decreased 3.5%, driven by a 5% decline in CSD volume and a 1% decline in non-carbonated beverage volume. The non-carbonated beverage volume decrease primarily reflected mid-single-digit declines in Gatorade sports drinks and in our juice and juice drinks portfolio, partially offset by a mid-single-digit increase in our overall water portfolio and a low-single-digit increase in Lipton ready-to-drink teas. Acquisitions had a nominal positive contribution to the volume performance. The 53 rd reporting week in 2016 negatively impacted volume performance by 1.5 percentage points. 62 Table of Contents Operating profit decreased 8%, primarily reflecting certain operating cost increases, the net revenue performance and a 2-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs. These impacts were partially offset by productivity savings and lower advertising and marketing expenses. Costs related to the hurricanes that occurred in 2017 negatively impacted operating profit performance by 1 percentage point and were offset by a gain associated with a sale of an asset. In addition, the 53 rd reporting week in 2016 negatively impacted operating profit performance by 1 percentage point and was offset by incremental investments in our business in 2016.

Additionally, Russia and Turkey experienced mid-single-digit growth. Operating profit increased 4%, reflecting the net revenue growth, productivity savings and a 4-percentage-point net impact of refranchising our entire beverage bottling operations and snack distribution operations in CHS. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases and an 8-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs. Additionally, a prior-year gain on the sale of our minority stake in Britvic 64 Table of Contents and the merger and integration charges related to our acquisition of SodaStream reduced operating profit growth by 7 percentage points and 4 percentage points, respectively. 2017 Net revenue increased 8%, reflecting volume growth and effective net pricing, as well as favorable foreign exchange, which contributed 3 percentage points to net revenue growth. Snacks volume grew 5%, reflecting high-single-digit growth in Russia, partially offset by a slight decline in the United Kingdom and a low-single-digit decline in Spain. Additionally, Turkey, South Africa and the Netherlands experienced mid-single-digit growth.

Snacks volume grew 5%, reflecting double-digit growth in India, China and Pakistan, partially offset by a mid-single-digit decline in the Middle East. Additionally, Australia experienced low-single-digit growth. 65 Table of Contents Beverage volume declined slightly, reflecting a mid-single-digit decline in the Middle East and a double-digit decline in the Philippines, partially offset by double-digit growth in Vietnam, mid-single-digit growth in India and low-single-digit growth in Pakistan and China. Operating profit grew 9%, primarily reflecting the effective net pricing, productivity savings and the net volume growth, partially offset by certain operating cost increases, higher advertising and marketing expenses and a 4-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs. The net impact of refranchising a portion of our beverage business in Thailand in 2018 contributed 13 percentage points to operating profit growth and was offset by a 16-percentage-point negative impact of the prior year refranchising of a portion of our beverage business in Jordan. 2017 Net revenue decreased 5%, reflecting unfavorable foreign exchange, which negatively impacted net revenue performance by 10 percentage points, primarily driven by a weak Egyptian pound. This impact was partially offset by effective net pricing. Snacks volume grew 5%, driven by high-single-digit growth in China and India and double-digit growth in Pakistan. Additionally, the Middle East experienced low-single-digit growth and Australia experienced mid-single-digit growth. Beverage volume declined 1%, reflecting a double-digit decline in India and a mid-single-digit decline in the Middle East, partially offset by mid-single-digit growth in China, high-single-digit growth in Pakistan and low-single-digit growth in the Philippines. Operating profit improvement primarily reflected a 2016 impairment charge to reduce the value of our 5% indirect equity interest in KSFB to its estimated fair value. The effective net pricing and productivity savings also increased operating profit growth. Additionally, the impact of refranchising a portion of our beverage business in Jordan contributed 14 percentage points to operating profit growth. These impacts were partially offset by certain operating cost increases and a 32-percentage-point impact of higher commodity costs, primarily due to transaction-related foreign exchange on raw material purchases driven by the weak Egyptian pound. Unfavorable foreign exchange translation reduced operating profit growth by 8 percentage points. 66 Table of Contents Our Liquidity and Capital Resources We believe that our cash generating capability and financial condition, together with our revolving credit facilities and other available methods of debt financing, such as commercial paper borrowings and long-term debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs. Our primary sources of cash available to fund cash outflows, such as our anticipated share repurchases, dividend payments, debt repayments and transition tax liability under the TCJ Act, include cash from operations, proceeds obtained from issuances of commercial paper and long-term debt and cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. However, there can be no assurance that volatility in the global capital and credit markets will not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our credit facilities. See also “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Our Business Risks” for further discussion. As of December 29, 2018 , we had cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash in our consolidated subsidiaries of $5.7 billion outside the United States. The restricted cash of approximately $2.0 billion held outside the United States relates to our acquisition of SodaStream. Refer to Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of restricted cash. The TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings, including $18.9 billion held in our consolidated subsidiaries outside the United States as of December 30, 2017. As of December 29, 2018, our mandatory transition tax liability is $3.8 billion. Under the provisions of the TCJ Act, this transition tax liability must be paid over eight years; we currently expect to pay approximately $0.4 billion of this liability in 2019 and the remainder over the period 2020 to 2026. See “Credit Facilities and Long-Term Contractual Commitments.” While our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act is deemed to be complete, this amount is based on prevailing regulations and currently available information, and any additional guidance issued by the IRS could impact the aforementioned amount in future periods. The IRS issued additional guidance in the first quarter of 2019 and we are currently evaluating the impact of this guidance. In connection with the TCJ Act, during 2018 we repatriated $20.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments held in our foreign subsidiaries without such funds being subject to further U.S. federal income tax liability. The repatriated cash was used primarily for repayment of commercial paper and to fund discretionary benefit plan contributions, debt repayments, dividend payments, share repurchases and our acquisition of SodaStream. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Our Business Risks,” “Items Affecting Comparability,” “Our Critical Accounting Policies,” as well as Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements. As of December 29, 2018 , cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments in our consolidated subsidiaries subject to currency controls or currency exchange restrictions were not material. Furthermore, our cash provided from operating activities is somewhat impacted by seasonality. Working capital needs are impacted by weekly sales, which are generally highest in the third quarter due to seasonal and holiday-related sales patterns, and generally lowest in the first quarter. On a continuing basis, we consider various transactions to increase shareholder value and enhance our business results, including acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures, dividends, share repurchases, productivity and other efficiency initiatives, and other structural changes. These transactions may result in future cash proceeds or payments. The table below summarizes our cash activity: 2018 2017 2016 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 9,415 $ 10,030 $ 10,663 Net cash provided by/(used for) investing activities $ 4,564 $ (4,403 ) $ (7,150 ) Net cash used for financing activities $ (13,769 ) $ (4,186 ) $ (3,211 ) 67 Table of Contents Operating Activities During 2018 , net cash provided by operating activities was $9.4 billion , compared to $10.0 billion in the prior year. The operating cash flow performance primarily reflects the discretionary contributions of $1.5 billion to our pension and retiree medical plans in the current year, partially offset by lower net cash tax payments in the current year. During 2017 , net cash provided by operating activities was $10 billion , compared to $10.7 billion in 2016. The operating cash flow performance primarily reflects unfavorable working capital comparisons to 2016. This decrease is mainly due to higher current year payments to vendors and customers, coupled with higher net cash tax payments in 2017, partially offset by lower pension and retiree medical plan contributions in 2017. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of pension contributions. Investing Activities During 2018 , net cash provided by investing activities was $4.6 billion , primarily reflecting net maturities and sales of debt securities with maturities greater than three months of $8.7 billion, partially offset by net capital spending of $3.1 billion and $1.2 billion of cash paid, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired, in connection with our acquisition of SodaStream. During 2017 , net cash used for investing activities was $4.4 billion , primarily reflecting net capital spending of $2.8 billion and net purchases of debt securities with maturities greater than three months of $1.9 billion. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of capital spending by division; see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our investments in debt securities. We expect 2019 net capital spending to be approximately $4.5 billion . Financing Activities During 2018 , net cash used for financing activities was $13.8 billion , primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases of $6.9 billion, payments of long-term debt borrowings of $4.0 billion, cash tender and exchange offers of $1.6 billion and net payments of short-term borrowings of $1.4 billion. During 2017 , net cash used for financing activities was $4.2 billion , primarily reflecting the return of operating cash flow to our shareholders through dividend payments and share repurchases of $6.5 billion and net payments of short-term borrowings of $1.1 billion, partially offset by net proceeds from long-term debt of $3.1 billion and proceeds from exercises of stock options of $0.5 billion. See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of debt obligations. We annually review our capital structure with our Board of Directors, including our dividend policy and share repurchase activity. On February 11, 2015, we announced a share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $12.0 billion of PepsiCo common stock which commenced on July 1, 2015 and expired on June 30, 2018 (2015 share repurchase program). The 2015 share repurchase program had approximately $4.3 billion of authorized repurchase capacity unused at expiration. On February 13, 2018, we announced the 2018 share repurchase program providing for the repurchase of up to $15.0 billion of PepsiCo common stock which commenced on July 1, 2018 and will expire on June 30, 2021. On February 15, 2019, we announced a 3% increase in our annualized dividend to $3.82 per share from $3.71 per share, effective with the dividend expected to be paid in June 2019. We expect to return a total of approximately $8 billion to shareholders in 2019 through share repurchases of approximately $3 billion and dividends of approximately $5 billion. 68 Table of Contents Free Cash Flow Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure. For further information on free cash flow see “Non-GAAP Measures.” The table below reconciles net cash provided by operating activities, as reflected in our cash flow statement, to our free cash flow. % Change 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 9,415 $ 10,030 $ 10,663 (6 ) (6 ) Capital spending (3,282 ) (2,969 ) (3,040 ) Sales of property, plant and equipment 134 180 99 Free cash flow (a) $ 6,267 $ 7,241 $ 7,722 (13 ) (6 ) (a) See “Non-GAAP Measures.” In addition, when evaluating free cash flow, we also consider the following items impacting comparability: $1.5 billion , $6 million and $459 million in discretionary pension and retiree medical contributions and associated net cash tax benefits of $473 million, $1 million and $151 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively; $266 million , $113 million and $125 million of payments related to restructuring charges and associated net cash tax benefits of $45 million , $30 million and $22 million in 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively; tax payments related to the TCJ Act of $115 million in 2018; certain other items of $47 million in 2018; net cash tax benefit related to debt redemption charge of $83 million in 2016; and net cash received related to interest rate swaps of $5 million in 2016. We will also consider payments related to the transition tax liability of $3.8 billion as of December 29, 2018, which we currently expect to be paid over the period 2019 to 2026 under the provisions of the TCJ Act, as an item impacting comparability. We use free cash flow primarily for financing activities, including debt repayments, dividends and share repurchases. We expect to continue to return free cash flow to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases while maintaining Tier 1 commercial paper access, which we believe will facilitate appropriate financial flexibility and ready access to global capital and credit markets at favorable interest rates. However, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Our Business Risks” for certain factors that may impact our credit ratings or our operating cash flows. Any downgrade of our credit ratings by a credit rating agency, especially any downgrade to below investment grade, whether or not as a result of our actions or factors which are beyond our control, could increase our future borrowing costs and impair our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us, or at all. In addition, any downgrade of our current short-term credit ratings could impair our ability to access the commercial paper market with the same flexibility that we have experienced historically, and therefore require us to rely more heavily on more expensive types of debt financing. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Our Business Risks” and Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Credit Facilities and Long-Term Contractual Commitments See Note 8 to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our credit facilities. 69 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our long-term contractual commitments by period: Payments Due by Period (a) Total 2019 2020 – 2021 2022 – 2023 2024 and beyond Long-term debt obligations (b) $ 28,351 $ — $ 7,166 $ 5,093 $ 16,092 Interest on debt obligations (c) 11,157 1,044 1,759 1,322 7,032 Operating leases (d) 1,840 459 700 371 310 Purchasing commitments (e) 2,602 982 1,221 252 147 Marketing commitments (e) 1,686 452 796 234 204 $ 45,636 $ 2,937 $ 11,642 $ 7,272 $ 23,785 (a) Based on year-end foreign exchange rates. Reserves for uncertain tax positions are excluded from the table above as we are unable to reasonably predict the ultimate amount or timing of any such settlements. However, under the provisions of the TCJ Act, our transition tax liability of $3.8 billion, of which $3.4 billion is recorded in other liabilities on our balance sheet, must be paid over eight years. We expect to pay approximately $0.4 billion in 2019, $0.3 billion per year in 2020-2023, $0.6 billion in 2024, $0.7 billion in 2025 and $0.9 billion in 2026 and these amounts are excluded from the table above. (b) Excludes $3,953 million related to current maturities of debt, $56 million related to the fair value adjustments for debt acquired in acquisitions and interest rate swaps and payments of $119 million related to unamortized net discounts. (c) Interest payments on floating-rate debt are estimated using interest rates effective as of December 29, 2018 . (d) See Note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on operating leases. (e) Primarily reflects non-cancelable commitments as of December 29, 2018 . Long-term contractual commitments, except for our long-term debt obligations and transition tax liability, are generally not recorded on our balance sheet. Operating leases primarily represent building leases. Non-cancelable purchasing commitments are primarily for oranges, orange juice and certain other commodities. Non-cancelable marketing commitments are primarily for sports marketing. Bottler funding to independent bottlers is not reflected in our long-term contractual commitments as it is negotiated on an annual basis. Accrued liabilities for pension and retiree medical plans are not reflected in our long-term contractual commitments. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our pension and retiree medical obligations. Off-Balance-Sheet Arrangements We do not have guarantees or other off-balance-sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity. We coordinate, on an aggregate basis, the contract negotiations of raw material requirements, including sweeteners, aluminum cans and plastic bottles and closures for us and certain of our independent bottlers. Once we have negotiated the contracts, the bottlers order and take delivery directly from the supplier and pay the suppliers directly. Consequently, transactions between our independent bottlers and suppliers are not reflected in our consolidated financial statements. As the contracting party, we could be liable to these suppliers in the event of any nonpayment by our independent bottlers, but we consider this exposure to be remote. 70 Table of Contents Return on Invested Capital ROIC is a non-GAAP financial measure.

These policies may require management to make difficult and subjective judgments regarding uncertainties, and as a result, such estimates may significantly impact our financial results. The precision of these estimates and the likelihood of future changes depend on a number of underlying variables and a range of possible outcomes. Other than our accounting for pension and retiree medical plans, our critical accounting policies do not involve a choice between alternative methods of accounting. We applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all material respects and for all periods presented. We have discussed our critical accounting policies with our Audit Committee. 71 Table of Contents Our critical accounting policies are: • revenue recognition; • goodwill and other intangible assets; • income tax expense and accruals; and • pension and retiree medical plans. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when our performance obligation is satisfied. Our primary performance obligation (the distribution and sales of beverage products and food and snack products) is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to our customers, which is also when control is transferred. The transfer of control of products to our customers is typically based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return. However, our policy for DSD and certain chilled products is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect. Similarly, our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. As a result, we record reserves, based on estimates, for anticipated damaged and out-of-date products. Our products are sold for cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry practices, typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the United States, and generally within 30 to 90 days internationally, and may allow discounts for early payment. We estimate and reserve for our bad debt exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility, the aging of accounts receivable and our analysis of customer data. Our policy is to provide customers with product when needed. In fact, our commitment to freshness and product dating serves to regulate the quantity of product shipped or delivered. In addition, DSD products are placed on the shelf by our employees with customer shelf space and storerooms limiting the quantity of product. For product delivered through other distribution networks, we monitor customer inventory levels. As discussed in “Our Customers” in “Item 1. Business,” we offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to customers for performing activities on our behalf, such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new products, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices. Sales incentives and discounts also include support provided to our independent bottlers through funding of advertising and other marketing activities. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our revenue recognition and related policies, including total marketplace spending. Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets We sell products under a number of brand names, many of which were developed by us. Brand development costs are expensed as incurred. We also purchase brands and other intangible assets in acquisitions. In a business combination, the consideration is first assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities, including brands and other intangible assets, based on estimated fair values, with any excess recorded as goodwill. Determining fair value requires significant estimates and assumptions based on an evaluation of a number of factors, such as marketplace participants, product life cycles, market share, consumer awareness, brand history and future 72 Table of Contents expansion expectations, amount and timing of future cash flows and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. We believe that a brand has an indefinite life if it has a history of strong revenue and cash flow performance and we have the intent and ability to support the brand with marketplace spending for the foreseeable future. If these indefinite-lived brand criteria are not met, brands are amortized over their expected useful lives, which generally range from 20 to 40 years. Determining the expected life of a brand requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors, including market share, consumer awareness, brand history, future expansion expectations and regulatory restrictions, as well as the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brand is sold. In connection with previous acquisitions, we reacquired certain franchise rights which provided the exclusive and perpetual rights to manufacture and/or distribute beverages for sale in specified territories. In determining the useful life of these franchise rights, many factors were considered, including the pre-existing perpetual bottling arrangements, the indefinite period expected for these franchise rights to contribute to our future cash flows, as well as the lack of any factors that would limit the useful life of these franchise rights to us, including legal, regulatory, contractual, competitive, economic or other factors. Therefore, certain of these franchise rights are considered as indefinite-lived. Franchise rights that are not considered indefinite-lived are amortized over the remaining contractual period of the contract in which the right was granted. Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and, as a result, are assessed for impairment at least annually, using either a qualitative or quantitative approach. We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter. Where we use the qualitative assessment, first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered include macroeconomic, industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environment, historical financial performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed. In the quantitative assessment, estimated fair value is determined using discounted cash flows and requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with management’s strategic business plans, annual sales growth rates, perpetuity growth assumptions and the selection of assumptions underlying a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. Significant management judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeconomic and other factors to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for indefinite-lived intangible assets, such as forecasted growth rates and weighted-average cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. These assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain of the risks described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Our Business Risks.” Amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows. See Note 2 and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements. Income Tax Expense and Accruals Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish reserves when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable, we believe that certain positions are subject to challenge and that we likely 73 Table of Contents will not succeed. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion. An estimated annual effective tax rate is applied to our quarterly operating results. In the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in our quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded at the same time as that item. We consider the tax adjustments from the resolution of prior year tax matters to be among such items. Tax law requires items to be included in our tax returns at different times than the items are reflected in our financial statements. As a result, our annual tax rate reflected in our financial statements is different than that reported in our tax returns (our cash tax rate). Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax returns in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit on our income statement. We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment has been deferred, or expense for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return but have not yet recognized as expense in our financial statements. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. Among its many provisions, the TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings and reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. As a result of the enactment of the TCJ Act, we recognized a provisional net tax expense of $2.5 billion ($1.70 per share) in the fourth quarter of 2017. Included in the provisional net tax expense of $2.5 billion recognized in 2017 is a provisional mandatory one-time transition tax of approximately $4 billion on undistributed international earnings, included in other liabilities. This provisional mandatory one-time transition tax was partially offset by a provisional $1.5 billion benefit resulting from the required remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the new, lower U.S. corporate income tax rate, effective January 1, 2018. The effect of the remeasurement was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, consistent with the enactment date of the TCJ Act and reflected in our provision for income taxes. During 2018, we recognized a net tax benefit of $28 million ($0.02 per share) in connection with the TCJ Act. See further information in “Items Affecting Comparability.” While our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act is deemed to be complete, these amounts are based on prevailing regulations and currently available information, and any additional guidance issued by the IRS could impact the aforementioned amounts in future periods. As a result of the TCJ Act, we currently expect our annual tax rate, excluding items affecting comparability, in percentage terms, to be in the low twenties in 2019. However, we continue to evaluate the impact of the TCJ Act on our annual tax rate due to certain provisions, such as the global intangible low-tax income (GILTI) provision, which may impact our tax rate in future years. In 2018 , our annual tax rate was (36.7)% compared to 48.9% in 2017 , as discussed in “Other Consolidated Results.” The tax rate decreased 85.6 percentage points compared to 2017, reflecting both other net tax benefits related to the reorganization of our international operations, which reduced the reported tax rate by 45 percentage points, and the prior year provisional net tax expense related to the TCJ Act, which reduced the current year reported tax rate by 25 percentage points. Additionally, the favorable conclusion of certain international tax audits and the favorable resolution with the IRS of all open matters related to the audits of 74 Table of Contents taxable years 2012 and 2013, collectively, reduced the reported tax rate by 7 percentage points. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements. Pension and Retiree Medical Plans Our pension plans cover certain employees in the United States and certain international employees. Benefits are determined based on either years of service or a combination of years of service and earnings. Certain U.S. and Canada retirees are also eligible for medical and life insurance benefits (retiree medical) if they meet age and service requirements. Generally, our share of retiree medical costs is capped at specified dollar amounts, which vary based upon years of service, with retirees contributing the remainder of the cost. In addition, we have been phasing out certain subsidies of retiree medical benefits. In 2016, we approved an amendment to reorganize the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans that resulted in the combination of two plans effective December 31, 2016, and the spinoff of a portion of the combined plan into a pre-existing plan effective January 1, 2017. The benefits offered to the plans’ participants were unchanged. The result of the reorganization was the creation of Plan A and the PepsiCo Employees Retirement Plan I (Plan I). The reorganization was made to facilitate a targeted investment strategy over time and to provide additional flexibility in evaluating opportunities to reduce risk and volatility. Actuarial gains and losses associated with Plan A are amortized over the average remaining service life of the active participants, while the actuarial gains and losses associated with Plan I are amortized over the remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants. As a result of these changes, the pre-tax net periodic benefit cost decreased by $42 million ($27 million after-tax, reflecting tax rates effective for the 2017 tax year, or $0.02 per share) in 2017, primarily impacting corporate unallocated expenses. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. In 2016, the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans purchased a group annuity contract whereby an unrelated insurance company assumed the obligation to pay and administer future annuity payments for certain retirees. In 2016, we made discretionary contributions of $452 million primarily to fund the transfer of the obligation. This transaction triggered a pre-tax settlement charge of $242 million ($162 million after-tax or $0.11 per share). See “Items Affecting Comparability” and Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. Our Assumptions The determination of pension and retiree medical expenses and obligations requires the use of assumptions to estimate the amount of benefits that employees earn while working, as well as the present value of those benefits. Annual pension and retiree medical expense amounts are principally based on four components: (1) the value of benefits earned by employees for working during the year (service cost), (2) the increase in the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time (interest cost), and (3) other gains and losses as discussed in Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements, reduced by (4) the expected return on assets for our funded plans. Significant assumptions used to measure our annual pension and retiree medical expenses include: • certain employee-related demographic factors, such as turnover, retirement age and mortality; • the expected return on assets in our funded plans; • for pension expense, the rate of salary increases for plans where benefits are based on earnings; • for retiree medical expense, health care cost trend rates; and • for pension and retiree medical expense, the spot rates along the yield curve used to determine service and interest costs and the present value of liabilities. 75 Table of Contents Certain assumptions reflect our historical experience and management’s best judgment regarding future expectations. All actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually, except in the case of an interim remeasurement due to a significant event such as a curtailment or settlement. Due to the significant management judgment involved, our assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension and retiree medical expenses and obligations. At each measurement date, the discount rates are based on interest rates for high-quality, long-term corporate debt securities with maturities comparable to those of our liabilities. Our U.S. obligation and pension and retiree medical expense is based on the discount rates determined using the Mercer Above Mean Curve. This curve includes bonds that closely match the timing and amount of our expected benefit payments and reflects the portfolio of investments we would consider to settle our liabilities. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for information about the expected rate of return on plan assets and our plans’ investment strategy. Although we review our expected long-term rates of return on an annual basis, our asset returns in a given year do not significantly influence our evaluation of long-term rates of return. The health care trend rate used to determine our retiree medical plans’ liability and expense is reviewed annually. Our review is based on our claims experience, information provided by our health plans and actuaries, and our knowledge of the health care industry. Our review of the trend rate considers factors such as demographics, plan design, new medical technologies and changes in medical carriers. Weighted-average assumptions for pension and retiree medical expense are as follows: 2019 2018 2017 Pension Service cost discount rate 4.4 % 3.7 % 4.3 % Interest cost discount rate 3.9 % 3.2 % 3.5 % Expected rate of return on plan assets 6.8 % 6.9 % 7.2 % Expected rate of salary increases 3.2 % 3.2 % 3.2 % Retiree medical Service cost discount rate 4.3 % 3.6 % 4.0 % Interest cost discount rate 3.8 % 3.0 % 3.2 % Expected rate of return on plan assets 6.6 % 6.5 % 7.5 % Current health care cost trend rate 5.7 % 5.8 % 5.9 % Based on our assumptions, we expect our total pension and retiree medical expense to increase in 2019 primarily driven by the recognition of prior experience losses on return on plan assets, partially offset by the impact of higher discount rates and discretionary plan contributions. Sensitivity of Assumptions A decrease in each of the collective discount rates or in the expected rate of return assumptions would increase expense for our benefit plans. A 25-basis-point decrease in each of the above discount rates and expected rate of return assumptions would individually increase 2019 pre-tax pension and retiree medical expense as follows: Assumption Amount Discount rates used in the calculation of expense $42 Expected rate of return $40 76 Table of Contents Funding We make contributions to pension trusts that provide plan benefits for certain pension plans. These contributions are made in accordance with applicable tax regulations that provide for current tax deductions for our contributions and taxation to the employee only upon receipt of plan benefits. Generally, we do not fund our pension plans when our contributions would not be currently tax deductible. As our retiree medical plans are not subject to regulatory funding requirements, we generally fund these plans on a pay-as-you-go basis, although we periodically review available options to make additional contributions toward these benefits. Our pension and retiree medical contributions are subject to change as a result of many factors, such as changes in interest rates, deviations between actual and expected asset returns and changes in tax or other benefit laws. We regularly evaluate different opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans. See Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for our past and expected contributions and estimated future benefit payments. 77 Table of Contents Consolidated Statement of Income PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries Fiscal years ended December 29, 2018 , December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 (in millions except per share amounts) 2018 2017 2016 Net Revenue $ 64,661 $ 63,525 $ 62,799 Cost of sales 29,381 28,796 28,222 Gross profit 35,280 34,729 34,577 Selling, general and administrative expenses 25,170 24,453 24,773 Operating Profit 10,110 10,276 9,804 Other pension and retiree medical benefits income/(expense) 298 233 (19 ) Interest expense (1,525 ) (1,151 ) (1,342 ) Interest income and other 306 244 110 Income before income taxes 9,189 9,602 8,553 (Benefit from)/provision for income taxes (See Note 5) (3,370 ) 4,694 2,174 Net income 12,559 4,908 6,379 Less: Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests 44 51 50 Net Income Attributable to PepsiCo $ 12,515 $ 4,857 $ 6,329 Net Income Attributable to PepsiCo per Common Share Basic $ 8.84 $ 3.40 $ 4.39 Diluted $ 8.78 $ 3.38 $ 4.36 Weighted-average common shares outstanding Basic 1,415 1,425 1,439 Diluted 1,425 1,438 1,452 See accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. 78 Table of Contents Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries Fiscal years ended December 29, 2018 , December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 (in millions) 2018 2017 2016 Net income $ 12,559 $ 4,908 $ 6,379 Other comprehensive income/(loss), net of taxes: Net currency translation adjustment (1,641 ) 1,109 (302 ) Net change on cash flow hedges 40 (36 ) 46 Net pension and retiree medical adjustments (467 ) (159 ) (316 ) Net change on available-for-sale securities 6 (68 ) (24 ) Other — 16 — (2,062 ) 862 (596 ) Comprehensive income 10,497 5,770 5,783 Comprehensive income attributable to noncontrolling interests (44 ) (51 ) (54 ) Comprehensive Income Attributable to PepsiCo $ 10,453 $ 5,719 $ 5,729 See accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. 79 Table of Contents Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries Fiscal years ended December 29, 2018 , December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 (in millions) 2018 2017 2016 Operating Activities Net income $ 12,559 $ 4,908 $ 6,379 Depreciation and amortization 2,399 2,369 2,368 Share-based compensation expense 256 292 284 Restructuring and impairment charges 308 295 160 Cash payments for restructuring charges (255 ) (113 ) (125 ) Charge related to the transaction with Tingyi — — 373 Pension and retiree medical plan expenses 221 221 501 Pension and retiree medical plan contributions (1,708 ) (220 ) (695 ) Deferred income taxes and other tax charges and credits (531 ) 619 452 Other net tax benefits related to international reorganizations (4,347 ) — — Net tax (benefit)/expense related to the TCJ Act (28 ) 2,451 — Change in assets and liabilities: Accounts and notes receivable (253 ) (202 ) (349 ) Inventories (174 ) (168 ) (75 ) Prepaid expenses and other current assets 9 20 10 Accounts payable and other current liabilities 882 201 981 Income taxes payable 333 (338 ) 329 Other, net (256 ) (305 ) 70 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities 9,415 10,030 10,663 Investing Activities Capital spending (3,282 ) (2,969 ) (3,040 ) Sales of property, plant and equipment 134 180 99 Acquisition of SodaStream, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired (1,197 ) — — Other acquisitions and investments in noncontrolled affiliates (299 ) (61 ) (212 ) Divestitures 505 267 85 Short-term investments, by original maturity: More than three months -

See accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements. 82 Table of Contents Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements Note 1 — Basis of Presentation and Our Divisions Basis of Presentation The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include the consolidated accounts of PepsiCo, Inc. and the affiliates that we control. In addition, we include our share of the results of certain other affiliates using the equity method based on our economic ownership interest, our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating or financial decisions of these affiliates or our ability to direct their economic resources. We do not control these other affiliates, as our ownership in these other affiliates is generally 50% or less. Intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. As a result of exchange restrictions and other operating restrictions, we do not have control over our Venezuelan subsidiaries. As such, our Venezuelan subsidiaries are not included within our consolidated financial results for any period presented. Raw materials, direct labor and plant overhead, as well as purchasing and receiving costs, costs directly related to production planning, inspection costs and raw materials handling facilities, are included in cost of sales. The costs of moving, storing and delivering finished product, including merchandising activities, are included in selling, general and administrative expenses. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates are used in determining, among other items, sales incentives accruals, tax reserves, share-based compensation, pension and retiree medical accruals, amounts and useful lives for intangible assets and future cash flows associated with impairment testing for perpetual brands, goodwill and other long-lived assets. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis using our historical experience, as well as other factors we believe appropriate under the circumstances, such as current economic conditions, and adjust or revise our estimates as circumstances change. As future events and their effect cannot be determined with precision, actual results could differ significantly from these estimates. Our fiscal year ends on the last Saturday of each December, resulting in an additional week of results every five or six years. Our fiscal 2016 results included an extra week. While our North America results are reported on a weekly calendar basis, most of our international operations report on a monthly calendar basis. Certain operations in our ESSA segment report on a weekly calendar basis. The following chart details our quarterly reporting schedule: Quarter United States and Canada International First Quarter 12 weeks January, February Second Quarter 12 weeks March, April and May Third Quarter 12 weeks June, July and August Fourth Quarter 16 weeks (17 weeks for 2016) September, October, November and December See “Our Divisions” below, and for additional unaudited information on items affecting the comparability of our consolidated results, see further unaudited information in “Items Affecting Comparability” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Unless otherwise noted, tabular dollars are in millions, except per share amounts. All per share amounts reflect common per share amounts, assume dilution unless otherwise noted, and are based on unrounded amounts. Certain reclassifications were made to the prior years’ financial statements to conform to the current year presentation, including the adoption of the recently issued accounting pronouncements disclosed in Note 2. 83 Table of Contents Our Divisions Through our operations, authorized bottlers, contract manufacturers and other third parties, we make, market, distribute and sell a wide variety of convenient beverages, foods and snacks, serving customers and consumers in more than 200 countries and territories with our largest operations in North America, Mexico, Russia, the United Kingdom and Brazil. Division results are based on how our Chief Executive Officer assesses the performance of and allocates resources to our divisions and are considered our reportable segments. For additional unaudited information on our divisions, see “Our Operations” contained in “Item 1. Business.” The accounting policies for the divisions are the same as those described in Note 2, except for the following allocation methodologies: • share-based compensation expense; • pension and retiree medical expense; and • derivatives. Share-Based Compensation Expense Our divisions are held accountable for share-based compensation expense and, therefore, this expense is allocated to our divisions as an incremental employee compensation cost. The allocation of share-based compensation expense of each division is as follows: 2018 2017 2016 FLNA 13 % 13 % 14 % QFNA 1 % 1 % 2 % NAB 18 % 18 % 22 % Latin America 8 % 7 % 7 % ESSA 9 % 9 % 11 % AMENA 8 % 9 % 10 % Corporate unallocated expenses 43 % 43 % 34 % The expense allocated to our divisions excludes any impact of changes in our assumptions during the year which reflect market conditions over which division management has no control. Therefore, any variances between allocated expense and our actual expense are recognized in corporate unallocated expenses. Pension and Retiree Medical Expense Pension and retiree medical service costs measured at fixed discount rates are reflected in division results. The variance between the fixed discount rate used to determine the service cost reflected in division results and the discount rate as disclosed in Note 7 is reflected in corporate unallocated expenses. Derivatives We centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include energy, agricultural products and metals . Commodity derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in corporate unallocated expenses. These derivatives hedge underlying commodity price risk and were not entered into for trading or speculative purposes. 84 Table of Contents Net revenue and operating profit of each division are as follows: Net Revenue Operating Profit (b) 2018 (a) 2017 2016 2018 2017 (c) 2016 (c) FLNA $ 16,346 $ 15,798 $ 15,549 $ 5,008 $ 4,793 $ 4,612 QFNA 2,465 2,503 2,564 637 640 649 NAB 21,072 20,936 21,312 2,276 2,700 2,947 Latin America 7,354 7,208 6,820 1,049 924 904 ESSA 11,523 11,050 10,216 1,364 1,316 1,061 AMENA 5,901 6,030 6,338 1,172 1,073 619 Total division 64,661 63,525 62,799 11,506 11,446 10,792 Corporate unallocated expenses — — — (1,396 ) (1,170 ) (988 ) $ 64,661 $ 63,525 $ 62,799 $ 10,110 $ 10,276 $ 9,804 (a) Our primary performance obligation is the distribution and sales of beverage products and food and snack products to our customers, each comprising approximately 50% of our consolidated net revenue. Internationally, our Latin America segment is predominantly a food and snack business, ESSA’s beverage business and food and snack business are each approximately 50% of the segment’s net revenue and AMENA’s beverage business and food and snack business are approximately 35% and 65% , respectively, of the segment’s net revenue. Beverage revenue from company-owned bottlers, which primarily includes our consolidated bottling operations in our NAB and ESSA segments, is approximately 40% of our consolidated net revenue. Generally, our finished goods beverage operations produce higher net revenue, but lower operating margins as compared to concentrate sold to authorized bottling partners for the manufacture of finished goods beverages. See Note 2 for additional information. (b) For further unaudited information on certain items that impacted our financial performance, see “Item 6. Selected Financial Data.” (c) Reflects the retrospective adoption of guidance requiring the presentation of non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost below operating profit. See Note 2 for additional information. Corporate Unallocated Expenses Corporate unallocated expenses include costs of our corporate headquarters, centrally managed initiatives such as commodity derivative gains and losses, foreign exchange transaction gains and losses, our ongoing business transformation initiatives, unallocated research and development costs, unallocated insurance and benefit programs, and certain other items. Other Division Information Total assets and capital spending of each division are as follows: Total Assets Capital Spending 2018 2017 2018 2017 2016 FLNA $ 6,577 $ 5,979 $ 840 $ 665 $ 801 QFNA 870 804 53 44 41 NAB 29,878 28,592 945 904 769 Latin America 6,458 4,976 492 481 507 ESSA (a) 17,410 13,556 479 481 439 AMENA 6,433 5,668 323 308 381 Total division 67,626 59,575 3,132 2,883 2,938 Corporate (b) 10,022 20,229 150 86 102 $ 77,648 $ 79,804 $ 3,282 $ 2,969 $ 3,040 (a) In 2018, the change in assets was primarily related to our acquisition of SodaStream. (b) Corporate assets consist principally of certain cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, short-term investments, derivative instruments, property, plant and equipment and tax assets. In 2018 , the change in assets was primarily due to a decrease in short-term investments and cash and cash equivalents.

These assets are reported in the country where they are primarily used. (b) Change in net revenue in 2017 primarily reflects appreciation of the Russian ruble. Change in long-lived assets in 2018 primarily reflects depreciation of the Russian ruble. (c) Change in long-lived assets in 2018 primarily related to our acquisition of SodaStream. Note 2 — Our Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when our performance obligation is satisfied. Our primary performance obligation (the distribution and sales of beverage products and food and snack products) is satisfied upon the shipment or delivery of products to our customers, which is also when control is transferred. Merchandising activities are performed after a customer obtains control of the product, are accounted for as fulfillment of our performance obligation to ship or deliver product to our customers and are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Merchandising activities are immaterial in the context of our contracts. The transfer of control of products to our customers is typically based on written sales terms that do not allow for a right of return. However, our policy for DSD and certain chilled products is to remove and replace damaged and out-of-date products from store shelves to ensure that consumers receive the product quality and freshness they expect. Similarly, our policy for certain warehouse-distributed products is to replace damaged and out-of-date products. As a result, we record reserves, based on estimates, for anticipated damaged and out-of-date products. In addition, upon adoption of the revenue recognition guidance (see subsequent discussion of “Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements - Adopted”), we exclude from net revenue and cost of sales, all sales, 86 Table of Contents use, value-added and certain excise taxes assessed by governmental authorities on revenue-producing transactions. Our products are sold for cash or on credit terms. Our credit terms, which are established in accordance with local and industry practices, typically require payment within 30 days of delivery in the United States, and generally within 30 to 90 days internationally, and may allow discounts for early payment. We estimate and reserve for our bad debt exposure based on our experience with past due accounts and collectibility, the aging of accounts receivable and our analysis of customer data. Bad debt expense is classified within selling, general and administrative expenses on our income statement. We are exposed to concentration of credit risk from our major customers, including Walmart. In 2018 , sales to Walmart (including Sam’s) represented approximately 13% of our consolidated net revenue, including concentrate sales to our independent bottlers, which were used in finished goods sold by them to Walmart. We have not experienced credit issues with these customers. Total Marketplace Spending We offer sales incentives and discounts through various programs to customers and consumers. Total marketplace spending includes sales incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to customers for performing activities on our behalf, such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new products, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices. Sales incentives and discounts also include support provided to our independent bottlers through funding of advertising and other marketing activities. A number of our sales incentives, such as bottler funding to independent bottlers and customer volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year for the expected payout. These accruals are based on contract terms and our historical experience with similar programs and require management judgment with respect to estimating customer participation and performance levels. Differences between estimated expense and actual incentive costs are normally insignificant and are recognized in earnings in the period such differences are determined. In addition, certain advertising and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred. The terms of most of our incentive arrangements do not exceed a year, and, therefore, do not require highly uncertain long-term estimates. Certain arrangements, such as fountain pouring rights, may extend beyond one year. Upfront payments to customers under these arrangements are recognized over the shorter of the economic or contractual life, primarily as a reduction of revenue, and the remaining balances of $218 million as of December 29, 2018 and $262 million as of December 30, 2017 are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets on our balance sheet. For additional unaudited information on our sales incentives, see “Our Customers” in “Item 1. Business.” For interim reporting, our policy is to allocate our forecasted full-year sales incentives for most of our programs to each of our interim reporting periods in the same year that benefits from the programs. The allocation methodology is based on our forecasted sales incentives for the full year and the proportion of each interim period’s actual gross revenue or volume, as applicable, to our forecasted annual gross revenue or volume, as applicable. Based on our review of the forecasts at each interim period, any changes in estimates and the related allocation of sales incentives are recognized beginning in the interim period that they are identified. In addition, we apply a similar allocation methodology for interim reporting purposes for certain advertising and other marketing activities. Our annual financial statements are not impacted by this interim allocation methodology. 87 Table of Contents Advertising and other marketing activities, reported as selling, general and administrative expenses, totaled $4.2 billion in 2018 , $4.1 billion in 2017 and $4.2 billion in 2016 , including advertising expenses of $2.6 billion in 2018 , $2.4 billion in 2017 and $2.5 billion in 2016 . Deferred advertising costs are not expensed until the year first used and consist of: • media and personal service prepayments; • promotional materials in inventory; and • production costs of future media advertising. Deferred advertising costs of $47 million and $46 million as of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 , respectively, are classified as prepaid expenses and other current assets on our balance sheet. Distribution Costs Distribution costs, including the costs of shipping and handling activities, which include certain merchandising activities, are reported as selling, general and administrative expenses. Shipping and handling expenses were $10.5 billion in 2018 , $9.9 billion in 2017 and $9.7 billion in 2016 . Cash Equivalents Cash equivalents are highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less. Software Costs We capitalize certain computer software and software development costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining computer software for internal use when both the preliminary project stage is completed and it is probable that the software will be used as intended. Capitalized software costs include (i) external direct costs of materials and services utilized in developing or obtaining computer software, (ii) compensation and related benefits for employees who are directly associated with the software projects and (iii) interest costs incurred while developing internal-use computer software. Capitalized software costs are included in property, plant and equipment on our balance sheet and amortized on a straight-line basis when placed into service over the estimated useful lives of the software, which approximate five to 10 years. Software amortization totaled $204 million in 2018 , $224 million in 2017 and $214 million in 2016 . Net capitalized software and development costs were $577 million and $686 million as of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 , respectively. Commitments and Contingencies We are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits, certain taxes and environmental matters, as well as commitments under contractual and other commercial obligations. We recognize liabilities for contingencies and commitments when a loss is probable and estimable. For additional unaudited information on our commitments, see “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Research and Development We engage in a variety of research and development activities and continue to invest to accelerate growth and to drive innovation globally. Consumer research is excluded from research and development costs and included in other marketing costs. Research and development costs were $680 million , $737 million and $ 760 million in 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , respectively, and are reported within selling, general and administrative expenses. See “Research and Development” in “Item 1. Business” for additional unaudited information about our research and development activities. 88 Table of Contents Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized and, as a result, are assessed for impairment at least annually, using either a qualitative or quantitative approach. We perform this annual assessment during our third quarter. Where we use the qualitative assessment, first we determine if, based on qualitative factors, it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Factors considered include macroeconomic, industry and competitive conditions, legal and regulatory environment, historical financial performance and significant changes in the brand or reporting unit. If the qualitative assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative assessment is performed. In the quantitative assessment of indefinite lived-intangible assets and goodwill, an assessment is performed to determine the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset and the reporting unit, respectively. Estimated fair value is determined using discounted cash flows and requires an analysis of several estimates including future cash flows or income consistent with management’s strategic business plans, annual sales growth rates, perpetuity growth assumptions and the selection of assumptions underlying a discount rate (weighted-average cost of capital) based on market data available at the time. Significant management judgment is necessary to estimate the impact of competitive operating, macroeconomic and other factors to estimate future levels of sales, operating profit or cash flows. All assumptions used in our impairment evaluations for indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill, such as forecasted growth rates and weighted-average cost of capital, are based on the best available market information and are consistent with our internal forecasts and operating plans. These assumptions could be adversely impacted by certain of the risks described in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Our Business Risks” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Amortizable intangible assets are only evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. If an evaluation of the undiscounted future cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on its discounted future cash flows. See also Note 4, and for additional unaudited information on goodwill and other intangible assets, see “Our Critical Accounting Policies” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Other Significant Accounting Policies Our other significant accounting policies are disclosed as follows: • Basis of Presentation – Note 1 includes a description of our policies regarding use of estimates, basis of presentation and consolidation. • Property, Plant and Equipment – Note 4. • Income Taxes – Note 5, and for additional unaudited information, see “Our Critical Accounting Policies” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. • Share-Based Compensation – Note 6. • Pension, Retiree Medical and Savings Plans – Note 7, and for additional unaudited information, see “Our Critical Accounting Policies” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. • Financial Instruments – Note 9, and for additional unaudited information, see “Our Business Risks” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. • Inventories – Note 15. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined using the average; first-in, first-out (FIFO) or, in limited instances, last-in, first-out (LIFO) methods. • Translation of Financial Statements of Foreign Subsidiaries – Financial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars using period-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities 89 Table of Contents and weighted-average exchange rates for revenues and expenses. Adjustments resulting from translating net assets are reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders’ equity as currency translation adjustment. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements - Adopted In 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued guidance to retrospectively present the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost for pension and retiree medical plans along with other compensation costs in operating profit and present the other components of net periodic benefit cost separately below operating profit in the income statement. The guidance also allows only the service cost component of net periodic benefit cost to be eligible for capitalization within inventory or fixed assets on a prospective basis. We adopted the provisions of this guidance retrospectively in the first quarter of 2018, using historical information previously disclosed in our pension and retiree medical benefits footnote as the estimation basis. We also updated our allocation of service costs to our divisions to better approximate actual service cost. The impact from retrospective adoption of this guidance resulted in an increase to cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses of $11 million and $222 million , respectively, for the year ended December 30, 2017 and an increase of $13 million and a decrease of $32 million , respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016. We recorded a corresponding increase of $233 million and decrease of $19 million for the years ended December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, to other pension and retiree medical benefits income/(expense) below operating profit. The (decreases)/increases to operating profit for each division and to corporate unallocated expenses are as follows: 2017 (a) 2016 (b) FLNA $ (30 ) $ (47 ) QFNA (2 ) (4 ) NAB (7 ) (12 ) Latin America 16 17 ESSA (38 ) (47 ) AMENA — — Corporate unallocated expenses (172 ) 112 (c) Total $ (233 ) $ 19 (a) Includes restructuring charges of $66 million , including $13 million in our FLNA segment, $2 million in our QFNA segment, $11 million in our NAB segment, $7 million in our Latin America segment and $33 million in corporate unallocated expenses. See “Items Affecting Comparability” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (b) Includes restructuring charges of $5 million , including $1 million in our FLNA segment, $2 million in our NAB segment and $2 million in corporate unallocated expenses. See “Items Affecting Comparability” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. (c) Reflects a settlement charge of $242 million related to a group annuity contract purchase. See “Items Affecting Comparability” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The changes described above had no impact on our consolidated net revenue, net income or earnings per share. See Note 7 for further information on our service cost and other components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and retiree medical plans. In 2016, the FASB issued guidance to clarify how restricted cash should be presented in the cash flow statement. We adopted the provisions of this guidance retrospectively during the first quarter of 2018; the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements and primarily related to collateral posted against our derivative asset or liability positions. See Note 9 and Note 13 for further information. 90 Table of Contents In 2016, the FASB issued guidance that requires companies to account for the income tax effects of intercompany transfers of assets, other than inventory, when the transfer occurs versus deferring income tax effects until the transferred asset is sold to an outside party or otherwise recognized. We adopted the provisions of this guidance during the first quarter of 2018; the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements and we recorded an adjustment of $8 million to beginning retained earnings. In 2016, the FASB issued guidance that requires companies to measure investments in certain equity securities at fair value and recognize any changes in fair value in net income. We adopted the provisions of this guidance during the first quarter of 2018; the adoption did not have an impact on our financial statements. See Note 9 for further information on our investments in equity securities. In 2014, the FASB issued guidance on revenue recognition, with final amendments issued in 2016. The guidance provides for a five-step model to determine the revenue recognized for the transfer of goods or services to customers that reflects the expected entitled consideration in exchange for those goods or services. It also provides clarification for principal versus agent considerations and identifying performance obligations. In addition, the FASB introduced practical expedients related to disclosures of remaining performance obligations, as well as other amendments related to guidance on collectibility, non-cash consideration and the presentation of sales and other similar taxes. Financial statement disclosures required under the guidance will enable users to understand the nature, amount, timing, judgments and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows relating to customer contracts. The two permitted transition methods under the guidance are the full retrospective approach or a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening retained earnings in the year of adoption (cumulative effect approach). We adopted the guidance applied to all contracts using the cumulative effect approach during the first quarter of 2018; the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements. We utilized a comprehensive approach to assess the impact of the guidance on our contract portfolio by reviewing our current accounting policies and practices to identify potential differences that would result from applying the new requirements to our revenue contracts, including evaluation of our performance obligations, principal versus agent considerations and variable consideration. We completed our contract and business process reviews and implemented changes to our controls and disclosures under the new guidance. As a result of the implementation of the guidance, which did not have a material impact on our accounting policies upon adoption, in the first quarter of 2018, we recorded an adjustment of $137 million to beginning retained earnings to reflect marketplace spending that our customers and independent bottlers expect to be entitled to in line with revenue recognition. In addition, we excluded from net revenue and cost of sales all sales, use, value-added and certain excise taxes assessed by governmental authorities on revenue-producing transactions that were not already excluded. The impact of these taxes previously recognized in net revenue and cost of sales was approximately $75 million for the fiscal year ended December 30, 2017, with no impact on operating profit. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements - Not Yet Adopted In 2018, the FASB issued guidance related to the TCJ Act for the optional reclassification of the residual tax effects, arising from the change in corporate tax rate, in accumulated other comprehensive loss to retained earnings. The reclassification is the difference between the amount previously recorded in other comprehensive income at the historical U.S. federal tax rate that remains in accumulated other comprehensive loss at the time the TCJ Act was effective and the amount that would have been recorded using the newly enacted rate. If elected, the guidance can be applied retrospectively to each period during which the impact of the TCJ Act is recognized or in the period of adoption. We will adopt the guidance when it becomes effective in the first quarter of 2019, but we are not planning to make the optional reclassification. 91 Table of Contents In 2017, the FASB issued guidance to amend and simplify the application of hedge accounting guidance to better portray the economic results of risk management activities in the financial statements. The guidance expands the ability to hedge nonfinancial and financial risk components, reduces complexity in fair value hedges of interest rate risk, eliminates the requirement to separately measure and report hedge ineffectiveness, as well as eases certain hedge effectiveness assessment requirements. Under this guidance, certain of our derivatives used to hedge commodity price risk that did not previously qualify for hedge accounting treatment will qualify prospectively. We will adopt the guidance when it becomes effective in the first quarter of 2019. The guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements or disclosures. See Note 9 for further information. In 2016, the FASB issued guidance on leases, with amendments issued in 2018. The guidance requires lessees to recognize most leases on the balance sheet but record expenses in the income statement in a manner similar to current accounting. For lessors, the guidance modifies the classification criteria and the accounting for sales-type and direct financing leases. The two permitted transition methods under the guidance are the modified retrospective transition approach, which requires application of the guidance for all comparative periods presented, and the cumulative effect adjustment approach, which requires prospective application at the adoption date. We continue to utilize a comprehensive approach to assess the impact of this guidance on our financial statements and related disclosures, including the increase in the assets and liabilities on our balance sheet and the impact on our current lease portfolio from both a lessor and lessee perspective. We are substantially complete with our comprehensive review of our lease portfolio including significant leases by geography and by asset type that will be impacted by the new guidance, and enhancing our controls. In addition, we are progressing on the implementation of a new software platform, and corresponding controls, for administering our leases and facilitating compliance with the new guidance. As part of our adoption, we will not reassess historical lease classification, will not recognize short-term leases on our balance sheet, will utilize the portfolio approach to group leases with similar characteristics and will not separate lease and non-lease components for our real estate leases. We will adopt the guidance prospectively when it becomes effective in the first quarter of 2019. The guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements, with an expected increase of approximately 2% to each of our total assets and total liabilities on our balance sheet, subject to completion of our assessment. See Note 15 for our minimum lease payments under non-cancelable operating leases. Note 3 — Restructuring and Impairment Charges A summary of our restructuring and impairment charges and other productivity initiatives is as follows: 2018 2017 2016 2019 Productivity Plan $ 138 $ — $ — 2014 Productivity Plan 170 295 160 Total restructuring and impairment charges 308 295 160 Other productivity initiatives 8 16 12 Total restructuring and impairment charges and other productivity initiatives $ 316 $ 311 $ 172 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan The 2019 Productivity Plan, publicly announced on February 15, 2019, will leverage new technology and business models to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes; re-engineer our go-to-market and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. 92 Table of Contents A summary of our 2019 Productivity Plan charges is as follows: 2018 Costs of sales $ 3 Selling, general and administrative expenses 100 Other pension and retiree medical benefits expense 35 Total restructuring and impairment charges $ 138 After-tax amount $ 109 Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share $ 0.08 2018 FLNA $ 31 QFNA 5 NAB 40 Latin America 9 ESSA 8 AMENA 3 Corporate 7 103 Other pension and retiree medical benefits expense 35 $ 138 A summary of our 2019 Productivity Plan activity is as follows: Severance and Other Employee Costs Asset Impairments Other Costs (a) Total 2018 restructuring charges $ 137 $ — $ 1 $ 138 Non-cash charges and translation (32 ) — — (32 ) Liability as of December 29, 2018 $ 105 $ — $ 1 $ 106 (a) Includes other costs associated with the implementation of our initiatives, including consulting and other professional fees. Substantially all of the restructuring accrual at December 29, 2018 is expected to be paid by the end of 2019 . 2014 Multi-Year Productivity Plan The 2014 Productivity Plan, publicly announced on February 13, 2014, includes the next generation of productivity initiatives that we believe will strengthen our beverage, food and snack businesses by: accelerating our investment in manufacturing automation; further optimizing our global manufacturing footprint, including closing certain manufacturing facilities; re-engineering our go-to-market systems in developed markets; expanding shared services; and implementing simplified organization structures to drive efficiency. To build on the 2014 Productivity Plan, in the fourth quarter of 2017, we expanded and extended the program through the end of 2019 to take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives described above to further strengthen our beverage, food and snack businesses. 93 Table of Contents A summary of our 2014 Productivity Plan charges is as follows: 2018 2017 2016 Selling, general and administrative expenses $ 169 $ 229 $ 155 Other pension and retiree medical benefits expense 1 66 5 Total restructuring and impairment charges $ 170 $ 295 $ 160 After-tax amount $ 143 $ 224 $ 134 Net income attributable to PepsiCo per common share $ 0.10 $ 0.16 $ 0.09 2018 2017 2016 Plan to Date FLNA $ 8 $ 67 $ 13 $ 171 QFNA 2 11 1 34 NAB 51 54 35 352 Latin America 30 63 27 182 ESSA 55 53 60 282 AMENA (a) 25 (3 ) 14 69 Corporate (b) (1 ) 50 10 114 $ 170 $ 295 $ 160 $ 1,204 (a) In 2017, income amount primarily reflects a gain on the sale of property, plant and equipment.

We regularly evaluate different productivity initiatives beyond the productivity plans and other initiatives described above. See additional unaudited information in “Items Affecting Comparability” and “Results of Operations – Division Review” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Note 4 — Property, Plant and Equipment and Intangible Assets A summary of our property, plant and equipment is as follows: Average Useful Life (Years) 2018 2017 2016 Property, plant and equipment, net Land $ 1,078 $ 1,148 Buildings and improvements 15 - 44 8,941 8,796 Machinery and equipment, including fleet and software 5 - 15 27,715 27,018 Construction in progress 2,430 2,144 40,164 39,106 Accumulated depreciation (22,575 ) (21,866 ) $ 17,589 $ 17,240 Depreciation expense $ 2,241 $ 2,227 $ 2,217 Property, plant and equipment is recorded at historical cost. Depreciation and amortization are recognized on a straight-line basis over an asset’s estimated useful life. Land is not depreciated and construction in progress is not depreciated until ready for service. A summary of our amortizable intangible assets is as follows: 2018 2017 2016 Amortizable intangible assets, net Average Useful Life (Years) Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Gross Accumulated Amortization Net Acquired franchise rights 56 – 60 $ 838 $ (140 ) $ 698 $ 858 $ (128 ) $ 730 Reacquired franchise rights 5 – 14 106 (105 ) 1 106 (104 ) 2 Brands 20 – 40 1,306 (1,032 ) 274 1,322 (1,026 ) 296 Other identifiable intangibles (a) 10 – 24 959 (288 ) 671 521 (281 ) 240 $ 3,209 $ (1,565 ) $ 1,644 $ 2,807 $ (1,539 ) $ 1,268 Amortization expense $ 69 $ 68 $ 70 (a) The change in 2018 is primarily related to our acquisition of SodaStream. Amortization of intangible assets for each of the next five years, based on existing intangible assets as of December 29, 2018 and using average 2018 foreign exchange rates, is expected to be as follows: 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Five-year projected amortization $ 89 $ 89 $ 87 $ 85 $ 83 Depreciable and amortizable assets are evaluated for impairment upon a significant change in the operating or macroeconomic environment. In these circumstances, if an evaluation of the undiscounted cash flows indicates impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value, which is based on discounted future 95 Table of Contents cash flows. Useful lives are periodically evaluated to determine whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate the need for revision. For additional unaudited information on our policies for amortizable brands, see “Our Critical Accounting Policies” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets We did not recognize any impairment charges for goodwill in each of the fiscal years ended December 29, 2018 , December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 . We recognized no material impairment charges for indefinite-lived intangible assets in each of the fiscal years ended December 29, 2018 , December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 . As of December 29, 2018 , the estimated fair values of our indefinite-lived reacquired and acquired franchise rights recorded at NAB exceeded their carrying values. However, there could be an impairment of the carrying value of NAB’s reacquired and acquired franchise rights if future revenues and their contribution to the operating results of NAB’s CSD business do not achieve our expected future cash flows or if macroeconomic conditions result in a future increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value. We have also analyzed the impact of the macroeconomic conditions in Russia and Brazil on the estimated fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets in these countries and have concluded that there were no material impairments for the year ended December 29, 2018 . However, there could be an impairment of the carrying value of certain brands in these countries if there is a deterioration in these conditions, if future revenues and their contributions to the operating results do not achieve our expected future cash flows, if there are significant changes in the decisions regarding assets that do not perform consistent with our expectations, or if macroeconomic conditions result in a future increase in the weighted-average cost of capital used to estimate fair value. For additional information on our policies for indefinite-lived intangible assets, see Note 2. 96 Table of Contents The change in the book value of indefinite-lived intangible assets is as follows: Balance, Beginning 2017 Translation and Other Balance, End of 2017 Acquisitions/ (Divestitures) Translation and Other Balance, End of 2018 FLNA Goodwill $ 270 $ 10 $ 280 $ 28 $ (11 ) $ 297 Brands 23 2 25 138 (2 ) 161 293 12 305 166 (13 ) 458 QFNA Goodwill 175 — 175 9 — 184 Brands — — — 25 — 25 175 — 175 34 — 209 NAB (a) Goodwill 9,843 11 9,854 — (41 ) 9,813 Reacquired franchise rights 7,064 62 7,126 — (68 ) 7,058 Acquired franchise rights 1,512 13 1,525 — (15 ) 1,510 Brands 314 39 353 — — 353 18,733 125 18,858 — (124 ) 18,734 Latin America Goodwill 553 2 555 — (46 ) 509 Brands 150 (9 ) 141 — (14 ) 127 703 (7 ) 696 — (60 ) 636 ESSA (b) Goodwill 3,177 275 3,452 526 (367 ) 3,611 Reacquired franchise rights 488 61 549 (1 ) (51 ) 497 Acquired franchise rights 184 11 195 (25 ) (9 ) 161 Brands 2,358 187 2,545 1,993 (350 ) 4,188 6,207 534 6,741 2,493 (777 ) 8,457 AMENA Goodwill 412 16 428 — (34 ) 394 Brands 103 8 111 — (10 ) 101 515 24 539 — (44 ) 495 Total goodwill 14,430 314 14,744 563 (499 ) 14,808 Total reacquired franchise rights 7,552 123 7,675 (1 ) (119 ) 7,555 Total acquired franchise rights 1,696 24 1,720 (25 ) (24 ) 1,671 Total brands 2,948 227 3,175 2,156 (376 ) 4,955 $ 26,626 $ 688 $ 27,314 $ 2,693 $ (1,018 ) $ 28,989 (a) The change in translation and other in 2018 primarily reflects the depreciation of the Canadian dollar. (b) The change in acquisitions/(divestitures) in 2018 is primarily related to the preliminary allocation of the purchase price for our acquisition of SodaStream. See Note 14 for further information. The change in translation and other in 2018 primarily reflects the depreciation of the Russian ruble, euro and Pound sterling. The change in translation and other in 2017 primarily reflects the appreciation of the Russian ruble and euro. 97 Table of Contents Note 5 — Income Taxes The components of income before income taxes are as follows: 2018 2017 2016 United States $ 3,864 $ 3,452 $ 2,630 Foreign 5,325 6,150 5,923 $ 9,189 $ 9,602 $ 8,553 The (benefit from)/provision for income taxes consisted of the following: 2018 2017 2016 Current: U.S. Federal $ 437 $ 4,925 $ 1,219 Foreign 378 724 824 State 63 136 77 878 5,785 2,120 Deferred: U.S. Federal 140 (1,159 ) 109 Foreign (4,379 ) (9 ) (33 ) State (9 ) 77 (22 ) (4,248 ) (1,091 ) 54 $ (3,370 ) $ 4,694 $ 2,174 A reconciliation of the U.S. Federal statutory tax rate to our annual tax rate is as follows: 2018 2017 2016 U.S. Federal statutory tax rate 21.0 % 35.0 % 35.0 % State income tax, net of U.S. Federal tax benefit 0.5 0.9 0.4 Lower taxes on foreign results (2.2 ) (9.4 ) (8.0 ) One-time mandatory transition tax - TCJ Act 0.1 41.4 — Remeasurement of deferred taxes - TCJ Act (0.4 ) (15.9 ) — International reorganizations (47.3 ) — — Tax settlements (7.8 ) — — Other, net (0.6 ) (3.1 ) (2.0 ) Annual tax rate (36.7 )% 48.9 % 25.4 % Tax Cuts and Jobs Act During the fourth quarter of 2017, the TCJ Act was enacted in the United States. Among its many provisions, the TCJ Act imposed a mandatory one-time transition tax on undistributed international earnings and reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% , effective January 1, 2018. As a result of the enactment of the TCJ Act, we recognized a provisional net tax expense of $2.5 billion ( $1.70 per share) in the fourth quarter of 2017. See further unaudited information in “Items Affecting Comparability” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Included in the provisional net tax expense of $2.5 billion recognized in the fourth quarter of 2017, was a provisional mandatory one-time transition tax of approximately $4 billion on undistributed international earnings, included in other liabilities. This provisional mandatory one-time transition tax was partially offset by a provisional $1.5 billion benefit resulting from the required remeasurement of our deferred tax assets and liabilities to the new, lower U.S. corporate income tax rate, effective January 1, 2018. The effect of the remeasurement was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2017, consistent with the enactment date of the TCJ Act, and reflected in our provision for income taxes. 98 Table of Contents During 2018, we recognized a net tax benefit of $28 million ( $0.02 per share) primarily reflecting the impact of the final analysis of certain foreign exchange gains or losses, substantiation of foreign tax credits, as well as cash and cash equivalents as of November 30, 2018, the tax year-end of our foreign subsidiaries, partially offset by additional transition tax guidance issued by the United States Department of Treasury, as well as the TCJ Act impact of both the conclusion of certain international tax audits and the resolution with the IRS of all open matters related to the audits of taxable years 2012 and 2013, each discussed below. As of December 29, 2018, our mandatory transition tax liability is $ 3.8 billion . Under the provisions of the TCJ Act, this transition tax liability must be paid over eight years; we currently expect to pay approximately $0.4 billion of this liability in 2019 and the remainder over the period 2020 to 2026. The TCJ Act also created a requirement that certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries, known as GILTI, must be included in the gross income of their U.S. shareholder. The FASB allows an accounting policy election of either recognizing deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or recognizing such taxes as a current-period expense when incurred. During the first quarter of 2018, we elected to treat the tax effect of GILTI as a current-period expense when incurred. In 2017, the SEC issued guidance related to the TCJ Act which allowed recording of provisional tax expense using a measurement period, not to exceed one year, when information necessary to complete the accounting for the effects of the TCJ Act is not available. We elected to apply the measurement period provisions of this guidance to certain income tax effects of the TCJ Act when it became effective in the fourth quarter of 2017. The provisional measurement period ended in the fourth quarter of 2018. While our accounting for the recorded impact of the TCJ Act is deemed to be complete, these amounts are based on prevailing regulations and currently available information, and any additional guidance issued by the IRS could impact the aforementioned amounts in future periods. For further unaudited information and discussion, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” “Our Business Risks,” “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” and “Our Critical Accounting Policies” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. International Reorganizations During the fourth quarter of 2018, we reorganized certain of our international operations, including the intercompany transfer of certain intangible assets. As a result, we recognized other net tax benefits of $4.3 billion ( $3.05 per share). The related deferred tax asset of $4.4 billion is expected to be amortized over a period of 15 years beginning in 2019. Additionally, the reorganization generated significant net operating loss carryforwards and related deferred tax assets that are not expected to be realized, resulting in the recording of a full valuation allowance. 99 Table of Contents Deferred tax liabilities and assets are comprised of the following: Deferred Tax Liabilities 2018 2017 Debt guarantee of wholly-owned subsidiary $ 578 $ 578 Property, plant and equipment 1,303 1,397 Intangible assets other than nondeductible goodwill — 3,169 Recapture of net operating losses 414 — Other 71 50 Gross deferred tax liabilities 2,366 5,194 Deferred tax assets Net carryforwards 4,353 1,400 Intangible assets other than nondeductible goodwill 985 — Share-based compensation 106 107 Retiree medical benefits 167 198 Other employee-related benefits 303 338 Pension benefits 221 22 Deductible state tax and interest benefits 110 157 Other 739 893 Gross deferred tax assets 6,984 3,115 Valuation allowances (3,753 ) (1,163 ) Deferred tax assets, net 3,231 1,952 Net deferred tax (assets)/liabilities $ (865 ) $ 3,242 A summary of our valuation allowance activity is as follows: 2018 2017 2016 Balance, beginning of year $ 1,163 $ 1,110 $ 1,136 Provision 2,639 33 13 Other (deductions)/additions (49 ) 20 (39 ) Balance, end of year $ 3,753 $ 1,163 $ 1,110 For additional unaudited information on our income tax policies, including our reserves for income taxes, see “Our Critical Accounting Policies” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Reserves A number of years may elapse before a particular matter, for which we have established a reserve, is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. Our major taxing jurisdictions and the related open tax audits are as follows: Jurisdiction Years Open to Audit Years Currently Under Audit United States 2014-2017 2014-2016 Mexico 2017 None United Kingdom 2016-2017 None Canada (Domestic) 2014-2017 2014-2015 Canada (International) 2010-2017 2010-2015 Russia 2014-2017 2014-2017 100 Table of Contents During 2018, we recognized a non-cash tax benefit of $364 million ( $0.26 per share) resulting from the conclusion of certain international tax audits. Additionally, during 2018, we recognized non-cash tax benefits of $353 million ( $0.24 per share) as a result of our agreement with the IRS resolving all open matters related to the audits of taxable years 2012 and 2013, including the associated state impact. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe that our reserves reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies. We adjust these reserves, as well as the related interest, in light of changing facts and circumstances. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. Favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to our annual tax rate in the year of resolution. For further unaudited information on the impact of the resolution of open tax issues, see “Other Consolidated Results” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. As of December 29, 2018 , the total gross amount of reserves for income taxes, reported in other liabilities, was $1.4 billion . We accrue interest related to reserves for income taxes in our provision for income taxes and any associated penalties are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. The gross amount of interest accrued, reported in other liabilities, was $179 million as of December 29, 2018 , which reflects a reduction of the prior year liability of $64 million of tax benefit that was recognized in 2018 . The gross amount of interest accrued, reported in other liabilities, was $283 million as of December 30, 2017 , of which $89 million of expense was recognized in 2017 . A reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows: 2018 2017 Balance, beginning of year $ 2,212 $ 1,885 Additions for tax positions related to the current year 142 309 Additions for tax positions from prior years 197 86 Reductions for tax positions from prior years (822 ) (51 ) Settlement payments (233 ) (4 ) Statutes of limitations expiration (42 ) (33 ) Translation and other (14 ) 20 Balance, end of year $ 1,440 $ 2,212 Carryforwards and Allowances Operating loss carryforwards totaling $24.9 billion at year-end 2018 are being carried forward in a number of foreign and state jurisdictions where we are permitted to use tax operating losses from prior periods to reduce future taxable income. These operating losses will expire as follows: $0.2 billion in 2019 , $20.5 billion between 2020 and 2038 and $4.2 billion may be carried forward indefinitely. We establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Undistributed International Earnings In connection with the enactment of the TCJ Act, during 2018, we repatriated $20.4 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments held in our foreign subsidiaries without such funds being subject to further U.S. federal income tax liability. As of December 29, 2018 , we had approximately $24 billion of undistributed international earnings. We intend to continue to reinvest $24 billion of earnings outside the United States for the foreseeable future and while U.S. federal tax expense has been recognized as a result of the TCJ Act, no deferred tax liabilities with respect to items such as certain foreign exchange gains or 101 Table of Contents losses, foreign withholding taxes or state taxes have been recognized. It is not practicable for us to determine the amount of unrecognized tax expense on these reinvested international earnings. Note 6 — Share-Based Compensation Our share-based compensation program is designed to attract and retain employees while also aligning employees’ interests with the interests of our shareholders. PepsiCo has granted stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs), performance stock units (PSUs), PepsiCo equity performance units (PEPunits) and long-term cash awards to employees under the shareholder-approved PepsiCo, Inc. Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). Executives who are awarded long-term incentives based on their performance may generally elect to receive their grant in the form of stock options or RSUs, or a combination thereof. Executives who elect stock options receive four stock options for every one RSU that would have otherwise been granted. Certain executive officers and other senior executives do not have a choice and were granted 66% PSUs and 34% long-term cash, each of which are subject to pre-established performance targets. The Company may use authorized and unissued shares to meet share requirements resulting from the exercise of stock options and the vesting of RSUs, PSUs and PEPunits. As of December 29, 2018 , 66 million shares were available for future share-based compensation grants under the LTIP. The following table summarizes our total share-based compensation expense and excess tax benefits recognized: 2018 2017 2016 Share-based compensation expense - equity awards $ 256 $ 292 $ 284 Share-based compensation expense - liability awards 20 13 5 Restructuring and impairment charges (6 ) (2 ) 5 Total $ 270 $ 303 $ 294 Income tax benefits recognized in earnings related to share-based compensation $ 45 $ 89 (a) $ 91 Excess tax benefits related to share-based compensation (b) $ 48 $ 115 $ 110 (a) Reflects tax rates effective for the 2017 tax year. (b) Included in provision for income taxes in the income statement in 2018 and 2017; included in capital in excess of par value in the equity statement in 2016. As of December 29, 2018 , there was $282 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation grants. This unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of two years. Method of Accounting and Our Assumptions The fair value of share-based award grants is amortized to expense over the vesting period, primarily three years. Awards to employees eligible for retirement prior to the award becoming fully vested are amortized to expense over the period through the date that the employee first becomes eligible to retire and is no longer required to provide service to earn the award. In addition, we use historical data to estimate forfeiture rates and record share-based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest. We do not backdate, reprice or grant share-based compensation awards retroactively. Repricing of awards would require shareholder approval under the LTIP. 102 Table of Contents Stock Options A stock option permits the holder to purchase shares of PepsiCo common stock at a specified price. We account for our employee stock options under the fair value method of accounting using a Black-Scholes valuation model to measure stock option expense at the date of grant. All stock option grants have an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and generally have a 10 -year term. Our weighted-average Black-Scholes fair value assumptions are as follows: 2018 2017 2016 Expected life 5 years 5 years 6 years Risk-free interest rate 2.6 % 2.0 % 1.4 % Expected volatility 12 % 11 % 12 % Expected dividend yield 2.7 % 2.7 % 2.7 % The expected life is the period over which our employee groups are expected to hold their options. It is based on our historical experience with similar grants. The risk-free interest rate is based on the expected U.S. Treasury rate over the expected life. Volatility reflects movements in our stock price over the most recent historical period equivalent to the expected life. Dividend yield is estimated over the expected life based on our stated dividend policy and forecasts of net income, share repurchases and stock price. A summary of our stock option activity for the year ended December 29, 2018 is as follows: Options (a) Weighted-Average Exercise Price Weighted-Average Contractual Life Remaining (years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (b) Outstanding at December 30, 2017 19,013 $ 74.23 Granted 1,429 $ 108.88 Exercised (4,377 ) $ 62.95 Forfeited/expired (476 ) $ 94.85 Outstanding at December 29, 2018 15,589 $ 79.94 4.29 $ 474,746 Exercisable at December 29, 2018 11,547 $ 70.74 2.92 $ 457,529 Expected to vest as of December 29, 2018 3,713 $ 106.02 8.17 $ 16,606 (a) Options are in thousands and include options previously granted under the PBG plan. No additional options or shares were granted under the PBG plan after 2009. (b) In thousands. Restricted Stock Units and Performance Stock Units Each RSU represents our obligation to deliver to the holder one share of PepsiCo common stock when the award vests at the end of the service period. PSUs are awards pursuant to which a number of shares are delivered to the holder upon vesting at the end of the service period based on PepsiCo’s performance against specified financial and/or operational performance metrics. The number of shares may be increased to the maximum or reduced to the minimum threshold based on the results of these performance metrics in accordance with the terms established at the time of the award. During the vesting period, RSUs and PSUs accrue dividend equivalents that pay out in cash (without interest) if and when the applicable RSU or PSU vests and becomes payable. The fair value of RSUs is measured at the market price of the Company’s stock on the date of grant. The fair 103 Table of Contents value of PSUs is measured at the market price of the Company’s stock on the date of grant with the exception of awards with market conditions, for which we use the Monte-Carlo simulation model to determine the fair value. The Monte-Carlo simulation model uses the same input assumptions as the Black-Scholes model; however, it also further incorporates into the fair-value determination the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied. Compensation costs related to these awards are recognized regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied, provided that the requisite service has been provided. A summary of our RSU and PSU activity for the year ended December 29, 2018 is as follows: RSUs/PSUs (a) Weighted-Average Grant-Date Fair Value Weighted-Average Contractual Life Remaining (years) Aggregate Intrinsic Value (a) Outstanding at December 30, 2017 7,293 $ 102.30 Granted (b) 2,634 $ 108.75 Converted (2,362 ) $ 99.73 Forfeited (647 ) $ 105.21 Actual performance change (c) 257 $ 98.92 Outstanding at December 29, 2018 (d) 7,175 $ 105.13 1.22 $ 791,878 Expected to vest as of December 29, 2018 6,667 $ 104.90 1.15 $ 735,813 (a) In thousands. (b) Grant activity for all PSUs are disclosed at target. (c) Reflects the net number of PSUs above and below target levels based on actual performance measured at the end of the performance period. (d) The outstanding PSUs for which the performance period has not ended as of December 29, 2018 , at the threshold, target and maximum award levels were zero , 0.9 million and 1.6 million , respectively. PEPunits PEPunits provide an opportunity to earn shares of PepsiCo common stock with a value that adjusts based upon changes in PepsiCo’s absolute stock price as well as PepsiCo’s Total Shareholder Return relative to the S&P 500 over a three -year performance period. The fair value of PEPunits is measured using the Monte-Carlo simulation model. PEPunits were last granted in 2015 and all 248,000 units outstanding at December 30, 2017, with a weighted average grant date fair value of $68.94 , were converted to 278,000 shares during fiscal year 2018. Long-Term Cash Certain executive officers and other senior executives were granted long-term cash awards for which final payout is based on PepsiCo’s Total Shareholder Return relative to a specific set of peer companies and achievement of a specified performance target over a three-year performance period. Long-term cash awards that qualify as liability awards under share-based compensation guidance are valued through the end of the performance period on a mark-to-market basis using the Monte Carlo simulation model until actual performance is determined. 104 Table of Contents A summary of our long-term cash activity for the year ended December 29, 2018 is as follows: Long-Term Cash Award (a) Balance Sheet Date Fair Value (a) Contractual Life Remaining (years) Outstanding at December 30, 2017 $ 33,200 Granted (b) 20,926 Forfeited (2,292 ) Actual performance change (c) 2,876 Outstanding at December 29, 2018 (d) $ 54,710 $ 55,809 1.22 Expected to vest as of December 29, 2018 $ 51,159 $ 52,148 1.17 (a) In thousands.

(d) The outstanding long-term cash awards for which the performance period has not ended as of December 29, 2018, at the threshold, target and maximum award levels were zero , 37.3 million and 74.5 million, respectively. Other Share-Based Compensation Data The following is a summary of other share-based compensation data: 2018 2017 2016 Stock Options Total number of options granted (a) 1,429 1,481 1,743 Weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted $ 9.80 $ 8.25 $ 6.94 Total intrinsic value of options exercised (a) $ 224,663 $ 327,860 $ 290,131 Total grant-date fair value of options vested (a) $ 15,506 $ 23,122 $ 18,840 RSUs/PSUs Total number of RSUs/PSUs granted (a) 2,634 2,824 3,054 Weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs/PSUs granted $ 108.75 $ 109.92 $ 99.06 Total intrinsic value of RSUs/PSUs converted (a) $ 260,287 $ 380,269 $ 359,401 Total grant-date fair value of RSUs/PSUs vested (a) $ 232,141 $ 264,923 $ 257,648 PEPunits Total intrinsic value of PEPunits converted (a) $ 30,147 $ 39,782 $ 38,558 Total grant-date fair value of PEPunits vested (a) $ 9,430 $ 18,833 $ 16,572 (a) In thousands. As of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 , there were approximately 248,000 and 250,000 outstanding awards, respectively, consisting primarily of phantom stock units that were granted under the PepsiCo Director Deferral Program and will be settled in shares of PepsiCo common stock pursuant to the LTIP at the end of the applicable deferral period, not included in the tables above. Note 7 — Pension, Retiree Medical and Savings Plans Effective January 1, 2017, the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans were reorganized into Plan A and Plan I. Actuarial gains and losses associated with Plan A are amortized over the average remaining service life of the active participants, while the actuarial gains and losses associated with Plan I are amortized over the remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants. As a result of this change, the pre-tax net periodic 105 Table of Contents benefit cost decreased by $ 42 million ($ 27 million after-tax, reflecting tax rates effective for the 2017 tax year, or $ 0.02 per share) in 2017, primarily impacting corporate unallocated expenses. See “Our Critical Accounting Policies” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. In 2016, the U.S. qualified defined benefit pension plans purchased a group annuity contract whereby an unrelated insurance company assumed the obligation to pay and administer future annuity payments for certain retirees. In 2016, we made discretionary contributions of $452 million primarily to fund the transfer of the obligation. This transaction triggered a pre-tax settlement charge of $242 million ( $162 million after-tax or $0.11 per share). See additional unaudited information in “Items Affecting Comparability” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Gains and losses resulting from actual experience differing from our assumptions, including the difference between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets, as well as changes in our assumptions, are determined at each measurement date. These differences are recognized as a component of net gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss. If this net accumulated gain or loss exceeds 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or plan liabilities, a portion of the net gain or loss is included in other pension and retiree medical benefits income/(expense) for the following year based upon the average remaining service life for participants in Plan A (approximately 10 years) and retiree medical (approximately 7 years), or the remaining life expectancy for participants in Plan I (approximately 25 years). The cost or benefit of plan changes that increase or decrease benefits for prior employee service (prior service cost/(credit)) is included in other pension and retiree medical benefits income/(expense) on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service life for participants in Plan A or the remaining life expectancy for participants in Plan I. 106 Table of Contents Selected financial information for our pension and retiree medical plans is as follows: Pension Retiree Medical U.S. International 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 Change in projected benefit liability Liability at beginning of year $ 14,777 $ 13,192 $ 3,490 $ 3,124 $ 1,187 $ 1,208 Service cost 431 401 92 91 32 28 Interest cost 482 468 93 89 34 36 Plan amendments 83 10 2 2 — (5 ) Participant contributions — — 2 2 — — Experience (gain)/loss (972 ) 1,529 (230 ) 5 (147 ) 21 Benefit payments (956 ) (825 ) (114 ) (104 ) (108 ) (107 ) Settlement/curtailment (74 ) (58 ) (35 ) (22 ) — — Special termination benefits 36 60 2 — 1 2 Other, including foreign currency adjustment — — (204 ) 303 (3 ) 4 Liability at end of year $ 13,807 $ 14,777 $ 3,098 $ 3,490 $ 996 $ 1,187 Change in fair value of plan assets Fair value at beginning of year $ 12,582 $ 11,458 $ 3,460 $ 2,894 $ 321 $ 320 Actual return on plan assets (789 ) 1,935 (136 ) 288 (21 ) 52 Employer contributions/funding 1,495 60 120 104 93 56 Participant contributions — — 2 2 — — Benefit payments (956 ) (825 ) (114 ) (104 ) (108 ) (107 ) Settlement (74 ) (46 ) (32 ) (18 ) — — Other, including foreign currency adjustment — — (210 ) 294 — — Fair value at end of year $ 12,258 $ 12,582 $ 3,090 $ 3,460 $ 285 $ 321 Funded status $ (1,549 ) $ (2,195 ) $ (8 ) $ (30 ) $ (711 ) $ (866 ) Amounts recognized Other assets $ 185 $ 286 $ 81 $ 85 $ — $ — Other current liabilities (107 ) (74 ) (1 ) (1 ) (41 ) (75 ) Other liabilities (1,627 ) (2,407 ) (88 ) (114 ) (670 ) (791 ) Net amount recognized $ (1,549 ) $ (2,195 ) $ (8 ) $ (30 ) $ (711 ) $ (866 ) Amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive loss (pre-tax) Net loss/(gain) $ 4,093 $ 3,520 $ 780 $ 782 $ (287 ) $ (189 ) Prior service cost/(credit) 109 29 (1 ) (3 ) (51 ) (71 ) Total $ 4,202 $ 3,549 $ 779 $ 779 $ (338 ) $ (260 ) Changes recognized in net loss/(gain) included in other comprehensive loss Net loss/(gain) arising in current year $ 760 $ 431 $ 103 $ (115 ) $ (107 ) $ (9 ) Amortization and settlement recognition (187 ) (131 ) (56 ) (60 ) 8 12 Foreign currency translation (gain)/loss — — (49 ) 73 1 1 Total $ 573 $ 300 $ (2 ) $ (102 ) $ (98 ) $ 4 Accumulated benefit obligation at end of year $ 12,890 $ 13,732 $ 2,806 $ 2,985 The net loss/(gain) arising in the current year is attributed to actual asset returns different from expected returns, partially offset by the change in discount rate. 107 Table of Contents The amount we report in operating profit as pension and retiree medical cost is service cost, which is the value of benefits earned by employees for working during the year. The amounts we report below operating profit as pension and retiree medical cost consist of the following components: • Interest cost is the accrued interest on the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time. • Expected return on plan assets is the long-term return we expect to earn on plan investments for our funded plans that will be used to settle future benefit obligations. • Amortization of prior service cost/(credit) represents the recognition in the income statement of benefit changes resulting from plan amendments. • Amortization of net loss/(gain) represents the recognition in the income statement of changes in the amount of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation based on changes in assumptions and actual experience. • Settlement/curtailment loss/(gain) represents the result of actions that effectively eliminate all or a portion of related projected benefit obligations. Settlements are triggered when payouts to settle the projected benefit obligation of a plan due to lump sums or other events exceed the annual service and interest cost. Settlements are recognized when actions are irrevocable and we are relieved of the primary responsibility and risk for projected benefit obligations. Curtailments are due to events such as plant closures or the sale of a business resulting in a reduction of future service or benefits. Curtailment losses are recognized when an event is probable and estimable, while curtailment gains are recognized when an event has occurred (when the related employees terminate or an amendment is adopted). • Special termination benefits are the additional benefits offered to employees upon departure due to actions such as restructuring. The components of total pension and retiree medical benefit costs are as follows: Pension Retiree Medical U.S. International 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 2016 Service cost $ 431 $ 401 $ 393 $ 92 $ 91 $ 80 $ 32 $ 28 $ 31 Interest cost 482 468 484 93 89 94 34 36 41 Expected return on plan assets (943 ) (849 ) (834 ) (197 ) (176 ) (163 ) (19 ) (22 ) (24 ) Amortization of prior service cost/(credits) 3 1 (1 ) — — — (20 ) (25 ) (38 ) Amortization of net losses/(gains) 179 123 168 45 53 40 (8 ) (12 ) (1 ) 152 144 210 33 57 51 19 5 9 Settlement/curtailment losses/(gain) (a) 8 8 245 6 11 9 — — (14 ) Special termination benefits 36 60 11 2 — 1 1 2 1 Total $ 196 $ 212 $ 466 $ 41 $ 68 $ 61 $ 20 $ 7 $ (4 ) (a) U.S. includes a settlement charge of $ 242 million related to the group annuity contract purchase in 2016.

Future Benefit Payments Our estimated future benefit payments are as follows: 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 - 2028 Pension $ 1,060 $ 960 $ 875 $ 915 $ 950 $ 5,265 Retiree medical (a) $ 115 $ 105 $ 100 $ 100 $ 95 $ 395 (a) Expected future benefit payments for our retiree medical plans do not reflect any estimated subsidies expected to be received under the 2003 Medicare Act. Subsidies are expected to be approximately $ 2 million for each of the years from 2019 through 2023 and approximately $6 million in total for 2024 through 2028. These future benefit payments to beneficiaries include payments from both funded and unfunded plans. Funding Contributions to our pension and retiree medical plans were as follows: Pension Retiree Medical 2018 2017 2016 2018 2017 2016 Discretionary (a) $ 1,417 $ 6 $ 459 $ 37 $ — $ — Non-discretionary 198 158 200 56 56 36 Total $ 1,615 $ 164 $ 659 $ 93 $ 56 $ 36 (a) Includes $1.4 billion contribution in 2018 to fund Plan A in the United States. Includes $ 452 million in 2016 relating to the funding of the group annuity contract purchase from an unrelated insurance company. 109 Table of Contents In January 2019, we made discretionary contributions of $ 150 million to Plan A in the United States. In addition, in 2019, we expect to make non-discretionary contributions of approximately $205 million to our U.S. and international pension benefit plans and approximately $40 million for retiree medical benefits. We regularly evaluate opportunities to reduce risk and volatility associated with our pension and retiree medical plans. Plan Assets Our pension plan investment strategy includes the use of actively managed accounts and is reviewed periodically in conjunction with plan liabilities, an evaluation of market conditions, tolerance for risk and cash requirements for benefit payments. This strategy is also applicable to funds held for the retiree medical plans. Our investment objective includes ensuring that funds are available to meet the plans’ benefit obligations when they become due. Assets contributed to our pension plans are no longer controlled by us, but become the property of our individual pension plans. However, we are indirectly impacted by changes in these plan assets as compared to changes in our projected liabilities. Our overall investment policy is to prudently invest plan assets in a well-diversified portfolio of equity and high-quality debt securities and real estate to achieve our long-term return expectations. Our investment policy also permits the use of derivative instruments, such as futures and forward contracts, to reduce interest rate and foreign currency risks. Futures contracts represent commitments to purchase or sell securities at a future date and at a specified price. Forward contracts consist of currency forwards. For 2019 and 2018 , our expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets is 7.1% and 7.2% , respectively. Our target investment allocations for U.S. plan assets are as follows: 2019 2018 Fixed income 47 % 47 % U.S. equity 29 % 29 % International equity 20 % 20 % Real estate 4 % 4 % Actual investment allocations may vary from our target investment allocations due to prevailing market conditions. We regularly review our actual investment allocations and periodically rebalance our investments. The expected return on plan assets is based on our investment strategy and our expectations for long-term rates of return by asset class, taking into account volatility and correlation among asset classes and our historical experience. We also review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of the long-term rates. We evaluate our expected return assumptions annually to ensure that they are reasonable. To calculate the expected return on plan assets, our market-related value of assets for fixed income is the actual fair value. For all other asset categories, such as equity securities, we use a method that recognizes investment gains or losses (the difference between the expected and actual return based on the market-related value of assets) over a five -year period. This has the effect of reducing year-to-year volatility. 110 Table of Contents Plan assets measured at fair value as of fiscal year-end 2018 and 2017 are categorized consistently by level, and are as follows: 2018 2017 Total Quoted Prices in Active Markets for Identical Assets (Level 1) Significant Other Observable Inputs (Level 2) Significant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3) Total U.S. plan assets (a) Equity securities, including preferred stock (b) $ 5,605 $ 5,595 $ 10 $ — $ 6,904 Government securities (c) 1,674 — 1,674 — 1,365 Corporate bonds (c) 4,145 — 4,145 — 3,429 Mortgage-backed securities (c) 212 — 212 — 217 Contracts with insurance companies (d) 9 — — 9 8 Cash and cash equivalents 215 215 — — 236 Sub-total U.S. plan assets 11,860 $ 5,810 $ 6,041 $ 9 12,159 Real estate commingled funds measured at net asset value (e) 618 675 Dividends and interest receivable, net of payables 65 69 Total U.S. plan assets $ 12,543 $ 12,903 International plan assets Equity securities (b) $ 1,651 $ 1,621 $ 30 $ — $ 1,928 Government securities (c) 433 — 433 — 492 Corporate bonds (c) 478 — 478 — 493 Fixed income commingled funds (f) 356 356 — — 383 Contracts with insurance companies (d) 36 — — 36 36 Cash and cash equivalents 27 27 — — 19 Sub-total international plan assets 2,981 $ 2,004 $ 941 $ 36 3,351 Real estate commingled funds measured at net asset value (e) 102 102 Dividends and interest receivable 7 7 Total international plan assets $ 3,090 $ 3,460 (a) 2018 and 2017 amounts include $285 million and $ 321 million , respectively, of retiree medical plan assets that are restricted for purposes of providing health benefits for U.S. retirees and their beneficiaries. (b) The equity securities portfolio was invested in U.S. and international common stock and commingled funds, and the preferred stock portfolio in the U.S. was invested in domestic and international corporate preferred stock investments. The common stock is based on quoted prices in active markets. The U.S. commingled funds are based on fair values of the investments owned by these funds that are benchmarked against various U.S. large, mid-cap and small company indices, and includes one large-cap fund that represents 15% and 19% of total U.S. plan assets for 2018 and 2017 , respectively. The international commingled funds are based on the fair values of the investments owned by these funds that track various non-U.S. equity indices. The preferred stock investments are based on quoted bid prices for comparable securities in the marketplace and broker/dealer quotes in active markets. (c) These investments are based on quoted bid prices for comparable securities in the marketplace and broker/dealer quotes in active markets. Corporate bonds of U.S.-based companies represent 28% and 23% of total U.S. plan assets for 2018 and 2017 , respectively. (d) Based on the fair value of the contracts as determined by the insurance companies using inputs that are not observable. The changes in Level 3 amounts were not significant in the years ended December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017. (e) The real estate commingled funds include investments in limited partnerships. These funds are based on the net asset value of the appraised value of investments owned by these funds as determined by independent third parties using inputs that are not observable. The majority of the funds are redeemable quarterly subject to availability of cash and have notice periods ranging from 45 to 90 days. (f) Based on the fair value of the investments owned by these funds that track various government and corporate bond indices. Retiree Medical Cost Trend Rates 2019 2018 Average increase assumed 6 % 6 % Ultimate projected increase 5 % 5 % Year of ultimate projected increase 2039 2039 111 Table of Contents These assumed health care cost trend rates have an impact on the retiree medical plan expense and liability, however the cap on our share of retiree medical costs limits the impact. Savings Plan Certain U.S. employees are eligible to participate in a 401(k) savings plan, which is a voluntary defined contribution plan. The plan is designed to help employees accumulate savings for retirement, and we make Company matching contributions for certain employees on a portion of eligible pay based on years of service. Certain U.S. salaried employees, who are not eligible to participate in a defined benefit pension plan, are also eligible to receive an employer contribution to the 401(k) savings plan based on age and years of service regardless of employee contribution. In 2018 , 2017 and 2016 , our total Company contributions were $180 million , $176 million and $164 million , respectively.

(b) The interest rates presented reflect weighted-average effective interest rates at year-end. Certain of our fixed rate indebtedness have been swapped to floating rates through the use of interest rate derivative instruments. See Note 9 for additional information regarding our interest rate derivative instruments. As of December 29, 2018 , our international debt of $62 million was related to borrowings from external parties including various lines of credit. These lines of credit are subject to normal banking terms and conditions and are fully committed at least to the extent of our borrowings. 112 Table of Contents In 2018 , we completed a cash tender offer for certain notes issued by PepsiCo and predecessors to a PepsiCo subsidiary for $1.6 billion in cash to redeem the following amounts: Interest Rate Maturity Date Amount Tendered 7.290 % September 2026 $ 11 7.440 % September 2026 $ 4 7.000 % March 2029 $ 357 5.500 % May 2035 $ 138 4.875 % November 2040 $ 410 5.500 % January 2040 $ 408 We also completed an exchange offer for certain notes issued by predecessors to a PepsiCo subsidiary for the following newly issued PepsiCo notes. These notes were issued in an aggregate principal amount equal to the exchanged notes: Interest Rate Maturity Date Amount 7.290 % September 2026 $ 88 7.440 % September 2026 $ 21 7.000 % March 2029 $ 516 5.500 % May 2035 $ 107 As a result of the above transactions, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $253 million ( $191 million after-tax or $0.13 per share) to interest expense, primarily representing the tender price paid over the carrying value of the tendered notes. See further unaudited information in “Items Affecting Comparability” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. In 2018, we entered into a new five-year unsecured revolving credit agreement (Five-Year Credit Agreement) which expires on June 4, 2023. The Five-Year Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $3.75 billion , subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $4.5 billion . Additionally, we may, once a year, request renewal of the agreement for an additional one-year period. Also in 2018, we entered into a new 364-day unsecured revolving credit agreement (364-Day Credit Agreement) which expires on June 3, 2019. The 364-Day Credit Agreement enables us and our borrowing subsidiaries to borrow up to $3.75 billion , subject to customary terms and conditions. We may request that commitments under this agreement be increased up to $4.5 billion . We may request renewal of this facility for an additional 364-day period or convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year, which would mature no later than the anniversary of the then effective termination date. The Five-Year Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Credit Agreement together replaced our $3.75 billion five-year credit agreement and our $3.75 billion 364-day credit agreement, both dated as of June 5, 2017. Funds borrowed under the Five-Year Credit Agreement and the 364-Day Credit Agreement may be used for general corporate purposes. Subject to certain conditions, we may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts under these agreements. As of December 29, 2018 , there were no outstanding borrowings under the Five-Year Credit Agreement or the 364-Day Credit Agreement. In 2016, we paid $2.5 billion to redeem all of our outstanding 7.900% senior notes due 2018 and 5.125% senior notes due 2019 for the principal amounts of $1.5 billion and $750 million , respectively, and terminated certain interest rate swaps. As a result, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $233 million ( $156 million after-tax or $0.11 per share) to interest expense, primarily representing the premium paid in accordance with the 113 Table of Contents “make-whole” redemption provisions. See further unaudited information in “Items Affecting Comparability” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. See “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further unaudited information on our borrowings and long-term contractual commitments. Note 9 — Financial Instruments Derivatives and Hedging We are exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in: • commodity prices, affecting the cost of our raw materials and energy; • foreign exchange rates and currency restrictions; and • interest rates. In the normal course of business, we manage commodity price, foreign exchange and interest rate risks through a variety of strategies, including productivity initiatives, global purchasing programs and hedging. Ongoing productivity initiatives involve the identification and effective implementation of meaningful cost-saving opportunities or efficiencies, including the use of derivatives. Our global purchasing programs include fixed-price contracts and purchase orders and pricing agreements. Our hedging strategies include the use of derivatives and, in the case of our net investment hedges, debt instruments. Certain derivatives are designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges and qualify for hedge accounting treatment, while others do not qualify and are marked to market through earnings. Cash flows from derivatives used to manage commodity price, foreign exchange or interest rate risks are classified as operating activities in the cash flow statement. We classify both the earnings and cash flow impact from these derivatives consistent with the underlying hedged item. See “Our Business Risks” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further unaudited information on our business risks. We do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes. We perform assessments of our counterparty credit risk regularly, including reviewing netting agreements, if any, and a review of credit ratings, credit default swap rates and potential nonperformance of the counterparty. Based on our most recent assessment of our counterparty credit risk, we consider this risk to be low. In addition, we enter into derivative contracts with a variety of financial institutions that we believe are creditworthy in order to reduce our concentration of credit risk. Commodity Prices We are subject to commodity price risk because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited in the competitive environment in which we operate. This risk is managed through the use of fixed-price contracts and purchase orders, pricing agreements and derivative instruments, which primarily include swaps and futures. In addition, risk to our supply of certain raw materials is mitigated through purchases from multiple geographies and suppliers. We use derivatives, with terms of no more than three years, to economically hedge price fluctuations related to a portion of our anticipated commodity purchases, primarily for energy, agricultural products and metals . Ineffectiveness for those derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting treatment was not material for all periods presented. Derivatives used to hedge commodity price risk that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are marked to market each period with the resulting gains and losses recorded in corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. These gains and losses are 114 Table of Contents subsequently reflected in division results when the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Our commodity derivatives had a total notional value of $1.1 billion as of December 29, 2018 and $0.9 billion as of December 30, 2017 . Foreign Exchange Our operations outside of the United States generated 43% of our net revenue in 2018 , with Mexico, Russia, Canada, the United Kingdom and Brazil comprising approximately 20% of our net revenue in 2018 . As a result, we are exposed to foreign exchange risks in the international markets in which our products are made, manufactured, distributed or sold. Additionally, we are exposed to foreign exchange risk from net investments in foreign subsidiaries, foreign currency purchases and foreign currency assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business. We manage this risk through sourcing purchases from local suppliers, negotiating contracts in local currencies with foreign suppliers and through the use of derivatives, primarily forward contracts with terms of no more than two years. Exchange rate gains or losses related to foreign currency transactions are recognized as transaction gains or losses on our income statement as incurred. We also use net investment hedges to partially offset the effects of foreign currency on our investments in certain of our foreign subsidiaries. Our foreign currency derivatives had a total notional value of $2.0 billion as of December 29, 2018 and $1.6 billion as of December 30, 2017 . The total notional amount of our debt instruments designated as net investment hedges was $0.9 billion as of December 29, 2018 and $1.5 billion as of December 30, 2017 . Ineffectiveness for derivatives and non-derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting treatment was not material for all periods presented. For foreign currency derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment, all gains and losses were offset by changes in the underlying hedged items, resulting in no material net impact on earnings. Interest Rates We centrally manage our debt and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks, tax consequences and overall financing strategies. We use various interest rate derivative instruments including, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps, Treasury locks and swap locks to manage our overall interest expense and foreign exchange risk. These instruments effectively change the interest rate and currency of specific debt issuances. Certain of our fixed rate indebtedness have been swapped to floating rates. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity date of the interest rate and cross-currency interest rate swaps match the principal, interest payment and maturity date of the related debt. Our Treasury locks and swap locks are entered into to protect against unfavorable interest rate changes relating to forecasted debt transactions. Our interest rate derivatives had a total notional value of $10.5 billion as of December 29, 2018 and $14.2 billion as of December 30, 2017 . Ineffectiveness for derivatives that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment was not material for all periods presented. As of December 29, 2018 , approximately 29% of total debt, after the impact of the related interest rate derivative instruments, was subject to variable rates, compared to approximately 43% as of December 30, 2017 . Available-for-Sale Securities Investments in debt securities are classified as available-for-sale. All highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents. Our investments in available-for-sale 115 Table of Contents debt securities are reported at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of available-for-sale debt securities are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss within common shareholders’ equity. Unrealized gains and losses on our investments in debt securities as of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 were not material. Changes in the fair value of available-for-sale debt securities impact net income only when such securities are sold or an other-than-temporary impairment is recognized. We regularly review our investment portfolio to determine if any debt security is other-than-temporarily impaired. In making this judgment, we evaluate, among other things, the duration and extent to which the fair value of a debt security is less than its cost; the financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto; and our intent to sell, or whether we will more likely than not be required to sell, the debt security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Our assessment of whether a debt security is other-than-temporarily impaired could change in the future due to new developments or changes in assumptions related to any particular debt security. We recorded no other-than-temporary impairment charges on our available-for-sale debt securities for the years ended December 29, 2018 , December 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 . In 2017, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $95 million ( $85 million after-tax or $0.06 per share), net of discount and fees, associated with the sale of our minority stake in Britvic. The gain on the sale of this equity investment was recorded in our ESSA segment in selling, general and administrative expenses. See Note 2 for additional information on investments in certain equity securities. KSF Beverage Holding Co., Ltd. During 2016, we concluded that the decline in estimated fair value of our 5% indirect equity interest in KSFB was other than temporary based on significant negative economic trends in China and changes in assumptions associated with KSFB’s future financial performance arising from the disclosure by KSFB’s parent company, Tingyi, regarding the operating results of its beverage business. As a result, we recorded a pre- and after-tax impairment charge of $373 million ( $0.26 per share) in 2016 in the AMENA segment. This charge was recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses on our income statement and reduced the value of our 5% indirect equity interest in KSFB to its estimated fair value. The estimated fair value was derived using both an income and market approach, and is considered a non-recurring Level 3 measurement within the fair value hierarchy. The carrying value of the investment in KSFB was $166 million as of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 . We continue to monitor the impact of economic and other developments on the remaining value of our investment in KSFB. See further unaudited information in “Items Affecting Comparability” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 116 Table of Contents Fair Value Measurements The fair values of our financial assets and liabilities as of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 are categorized as follows: 2018 2017 Fair Value Hierarchy Levels (a) Assets (a) Liabilities (a) Assets (a) Liabilities (a) Available-for-sale debt securities (b) 2 $ 3,658 $ — $ 14,510 $ — Short-term investments (c) 1 $ 196 $ — $ 228 $ — Prepaid forward contracts (d) 2 $ 22 $ — $ 27 $ — Deferred compensation (e) 2 $ — $ 450 $ — $ 503 Derivatives designated as fair value hedging instruments: Interest rate (f) 2 $ 1 $ 108 $ 24 $ 130 Derivatives designated as cash flow hedging instruments: Foreign exchange (g) 2 $ 44 $ 14 $ 15 $ 31 Interest rate (g) 2 — 323 — 213 Commodity (h) 1 — 1 — 2 Commodity (i) 2 — 3 2 — $ 44 $ 341 $ 17 $ 246 Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments: Foreign exchange (g) 2 $ 3 $ 10 $ 10 $ 3 Commodity (h) 1 2 17 — 19 Commodity (i) 2 5 92 85 12 $ 10 $ 119 $ 95 $ 34 Total derivatives at fair value (j) $ 55 $ 568 $ 136 $ 410 Total $ 3,931 $ 1,018 $ 14,901 $ 913 (a) Fair value hierarchy levels are defined in Note 7.

As of December 29, 2018 , these debt securities were primarily classified as cash equivalents. As of December 30, 2017 , $5.8 billion and $8.7 billion of debt securities were classified as cash equivalents and short-term investments, respectively. The decrease primarily reflects net maturities and sales of debt securities with maturities greater than three months. Refer to the cash flow statement and “Our Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for further discussion on use of these proceeds.

Amounts subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements which are not offset on the balance sheet as of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017 were not material. Collateral received or posted against any of our asset or liability positions were not material. Collateral posted is classified as restricted cash. See Note 13 for further information. The carrying amounts of our cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments approximate fair value due to their short-term maturity. The fair value of our debt obligations as of December 29, 2018 and 117 Table of Contents December 30, 2017 was $32 billion and $41 billion , respectively, based upon prices of similar instruments in the marketplace, which are considered Level 2 inputs. Losses/(gains) on our hedging instruments are categorized as follows: Fair Value/Non- designated Hedges Cash Flow and Net Investment Hedges Losses/(Gains) Recognized in Income Statement (a) Losses/(Gains) Recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss Losses/(Gains) Reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss into Income Statement (b) 2018 2017 2018 2017 2018 2017 Foreign exchange $ 9 $ (15 ) $ (52 ) $ 62 $ (8 ) $ 10 Interest rate 53 101 110 (195 ) 119 (184 ) Commodity 117 (48 ) 3 3 — 3 Net investment — — (77 ) 157 — — Total $ 179 $ 38 $ (16 ) $ 27 $ 111 $ (171 ) (a) Foreign exchange derivative losses/gains are primarily included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Interest rate derivative losses/gains are primarily from fair value hedges and are included in interest expense. These losses/gains are substantially offset by decreases/increases in the value of the underlying debt, which are also included in interest expense. Commodity derivative losses/gains are included in either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity. (b) Foreign exchange derivative losses/gains are primarily included in cost of sales. Interest rate derivative losses/gains are included in interest expense. Commodity derivative losses/gains are included in either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying commodity.

Note 14 — Acquisitions and Divestitures Acquisition of SodaStream International Ltd. On December 5, 2018, we acquired all of the outstanding shares of SodaStream, a manufacturer and distributor of sparkling water makers, for $144.00 per share in cash, in a transaction valued at approximately $3.3 billion . The total consideration transferred was approximately $3.3 billion (or $3.2 billion , net of cash and cash equivalents acquired), including $2.0 billion of consideration held by our paying agent in connection with this acquisition and reported as restricted cash as of December 29, 2018. We accounted for the transaction as a business combination. We recognized and measured the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated fair values on the date of acquisition. The preliminary estimates of the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in SodaStream as of the acquisition date include goodwill and other intangible assets of $3.0 billion and property, plant and equipment of $0.2 billion , all of which are recorded in our ESSA segment. The preliminary estimates of the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are subject to revisions, which may result in adjustments to the preliminary values discussed above as valuations are finalized. We expect to finalize these amounts as soon as possible, but no later than the end of 2019. Under the guidance on accounting for business combinations, merger and integration costs are not included as components of consideration transferred but are accounted for as expenses in the period in which the costs are incurred. In 2018, we incurred merger and integration charges of $75 million ( $0.05 per share), including $57 million in our ESSA segment and $18 million in corporate unallocated expenses. These charges include closing costs, advisory fees and employee-related costs and were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. See “Item 6.

We maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the specified time periods. We monitor these internal controls through self-assessments and an ongoing program of internal audits. Our internal controls are reinforced through our Global Code of Conduct, which sets forth our commitment to conduct business with integrity, and within both the letter and the spirit of the law. Exerting rigorous oversight of the business. We continuously review our business results and strategies. This encompasses financial discipline in our strategic and daily business decisions.

GALLAGHER Marie T. Gallagher Senior Vice President and Controller (Principal Accounting Officer) /s/ HUGH F. JOHNSTON Hugh F. Johnston Vice Chairman, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer /s/ RAMON L. LAGUARTA Ramon L. Laguarta Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer 127 Table of Contents Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Shareholders and Board of Directors PepsiCo, Inc.: Opinions on the Consolidated Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of PepsiCo, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, and the related Consolidated Statements of Income, Comprehensive Income, Cash Flows, and Equity for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 29, 2018 and the related notes (collectively, the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 29, 2018 and December 30, 2017, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the fiscal years in the three-year period ended December 29, 2018, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2018, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As permitted by SEC guidance, the scope of management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 29, 2018 excluded SodaStream International Ltd. and its subsidiaries (“SodaStream”), which the Company acquired in December 2018. SodaStream’s total assets and net revenue represented approximately 5% and 1%, respectively, of the consolidated total assets and net revenue of PepsiCo, Inc. as of and for the year ended December 29, 2018. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of PepsiCo, Inc. also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of SodaStream. Basis for Opinions The Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over 128 Table of Contents financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ KPMG LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1990.

(c) Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Except as discussed, there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during our fourth fiscal quarter of 2018 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. During our fourth fiscal quarter of 2018 , we continued migrating certain of our financial processing systems to an enterprise-wide systems solution. These systems implementations are part of our ongoing global business 132 Table of Contents transformation initiative, and we plan to continue implementing such systems throughout other parts of our businesses. In addition, in connection with our 2019 multi-year productivity program, we continue to migrate to shared business models across our operations to further simplify, harmonize and automate processes.
